All Klonoped Out

So I knew I had some of this stuff in my house, and I heard it was pretty fun to mess with, so I did the dumb thing and shoved 2 .5mg pills up my nose and ate 4 more.  This all happened at about 9:30 at night.  Onset started after about 20 minutes, and kicked me in the arse after about 50.  Mildly euphoric, it felt like a weird drunk.  Stairs were a riot, but manageable.

I went to bed, put on some chill tunes, and totaly passed out.  The next morning is a blur, I recall being very tired.  Stupid me, turns out I had school the next day.  I was late to my second class, and my teacher asked me to tell him the time when I walked in.  This was about 9:40 or so, but I responded 'uhh 12 something'.  Fell asleep after about 10 minutes in class.  The sleep was very deep, but I awoke disoriented and everyone had already left the class.  The rest of the day is difficult to remember, but no real problems.  Mental clouds drifted away at about 3:00 PM that afternoon, memory was total crap for a couple days.
