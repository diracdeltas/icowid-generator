I took 3 pills and I didn't think it was going to do anything. To my suprise, it had a somewhat powerful effect. It makes me feel like a child. I seem to be content with everything. Nothing makes me particularly mad and nothing gets me really excited. I also seem to lose interest in things I generally like. My daily emotions are gone.
