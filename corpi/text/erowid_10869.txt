I just read some of the reports about Paxil.  I thought it was just me that had the bad withdrawal symptoms and saw trails in the morning.  I wonder sometimes why I only see traisl when I wake up.  Even if I nap during the day I wake up and see them.  Also, when I first started taking it, I ran out after about 2 months, and I was a wreck!!  I started acting like I was 5 or something.  I threw tantrums, I cried at the drop of a hat, I was all clingy with my grrrlfriend.  It was a terrible time.  I'm thinkin that maybe I will switch drugs.  Paxil has been more trouble than it is worth
