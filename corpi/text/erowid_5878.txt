At over 500 lbs, and with no M.D. in sight willing to aggresively manage my case, I decided to take the risk of managing my own regime of Methamphetamine.

At 42, had never used ANY illicit drug.  Worst addiction was to Diet Dr. Pepper.  Thus started snorting small amounts of meth spread every 2-4 hours.  Since work schedule was 36 hours on and 12 hours off without checmical assistance, the energy boost and mental clarity was much welcomed.  Actually slowed my speech and gave me much more patience.  Would abstain every 14 days for 7.  Moderate exercise included.  65-70 lbs lost.

About 6 months ago, was encouraged to try 'high' of 'slamming' (water and crystal meth injected directly into vein).  The world changed forever.

The 'glow' gave me new perspective.  Saved my marrige.  By the way, after 18 months of using meth, the last 6 via slam, my wife has no idea that I use anything.  Weight loss continues and I am at approx 350, with another 100 to go.

Already an empath by birth, the meth increased bioelectrical sensitivity to incredible levels.  Only draw back - Sexual sensations and drive increased exponentially, and due to medical condition wife has difficult time with sex.

Then came the next step.  While getting a massage to reduce sexual tension, companion suggested removing needle of syringe and injecting meth solution into urinary tract through head of penis.  Now would write bad checks for 'tweaker dick' orgasms.  Explosive and beyond describing.

Greatest fantasy is to find non-tweaker personality that loves self to share high and oral sex.
