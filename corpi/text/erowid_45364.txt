After eating a couple of shrooms (3-4 stems??), everything started to sway back and forth. Wverything turned into moving 'clouds'. I fell asleep shortly after taking a walk.... Woke up after 3-4 hours, with a beginning of a cold sore, which turned into the biggest cold sore I have ever seen... and lasted for about a week or two. This 'cold core' spread onto my cheek and definitely turned me off the wonderful shrooms.
