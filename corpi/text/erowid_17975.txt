A few years ago, I was constantly depressed and wanted to find an excape from it all. A friend of mine was on wellbutrin time released pills, and she said if I took enough I would hallucinate. So, she gave me 8 or 9 pills, I don't really remember. When I got home from school, I popped them all at once. I waited, and I don't remember how long, but they started to kick in. I remember I was curled up on my computer chair, mindlessly surfing the internet, when I looked down and saw the top of my desk almost crawling. It looked like it was made of murky brown mud, that kept moving. I also felt very thirsty, so I decided to get a drink. Now what you have got to understand is I have an EXTREME phobia of insects. So, I'm walking out to my kitchen, and I look down and see my floor is COVERED in spiders and ants. Realizing all of this was too much to handle, I went back into my room. By now it had been about 5 hours since I had taken them. I was feeling ill, so I layed down in my bed. Suddenly, I started getting VERY COLD. I quickly got into a hot shower, so hot it scalded my skin, but the whole time I couldn't stop shaking. When I got out I realized I had the water so hot my entire body was red and sore to the touch. I then lay back into my bed, and passed out, sleeping to the next day. This was about 6:30 on a friday. Saturday I still felt ill, and my pupils were dilated for days afterwards.
