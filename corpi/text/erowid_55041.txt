A friend of mine, who smoked weed heavily, smoked several blunts a day.  When I smoked his favorite brand with him, the day after I noticed a difficulty breathing and pain in my lungs.  I told him jokingly 'that shit (blunt wrappers) will kill you'.  Previously, this guy never did any drugs and was against doing them.  People promised him he'd be fine, they said, 'Just keep away from hard drugs'.  After about six months since starting smoking weed (he wasn't a cigarette smoker either) he came down with a cold that wouldn't go away and was hospitalized, later his lung collapsed and he eventually passed away.  Now, I cannot prove that blunts caused his untimely death, but this is SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT!
