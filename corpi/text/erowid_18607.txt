Pyracetam+cannabis=LSD

I was about to go to a expensive club in Sofia called 'Escape'. I eat two tablets pyracetam and three tablespoons grinded weed (strong one). 

The onset pleased me, when me and my friend entered the club (about one hour after). And the following was amazingly new experience for me. I had taken before only weed in large amounts orally but the effect was more deliriant. Now that was the pyracetam I was sure. The sound boxes beat with house music good quality sound and beautiful selection. During the 'kick' which lasted the amazing 50 min. I was seeing dynamic 3+dimentional patterns impressionist style designs carpets from crystals in unearthly colours. Giant light spheres, animals. The sounds from voices and music arrived to me as one single entity! I felt in painted garden and that sound was bird songs, wind. 

Suddenly (like in Salvia divinorum otherworldy shifts) I was in garden, around me were field and surealistic vines and Ruh birds (see arabian mithology). The imagery changes each second entering deeper, brighter realms. <!--Jesus you have to try this!--> A golden octopus with 50 legs in front of a deep black vast vast eternal space was dancing for me and I felt that God God and nothing else gave me the idea to combine weed with pyracetam. Because I was meant to see all this. I had revelations about eternality universe hyperspatial structure of space, secrets of quasars and galaxies. I saw all parallel worlds embedded one into another and separate one from another in the same order. Extasy for about 6 hours he he! ! 

SUMMARY: <!--I recomend: Do not smoke or take any drugs for two tree days than go to expensive club with trance; house ; ambient; drum and bass wave or other mind phenomena amplifying music (and donnot forget to take 2-3 tablets pyracetam and weed one hour before) -->Relaxed completely and entered something new unexplored and beautiful. <!--Good luck my dear friends I love you.-->
