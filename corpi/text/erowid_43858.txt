I heard about lotus from a good friend who said that smoking lotus made him happy
I then orderd 1/2 ounze of N. caerulea - Blue Lily Flower and 1 ounze of White Lotus (Nymphaea alba)

I first smoked a bowl and a 1/2 of the blue lilly with no effects ( maybe a little relaxation) the smoke was harsh.

I then tried the tea. I placed a large Tble spoon of blue lilly and one dried flower of White lotus in a tea holder. Boiled some water and put the stuff in and let it rest for about 15 minutes. My first sip was horrible so I then added some honey and a handfull of brown sugar to the tea because of its taste, took 15-30 minutes to drink. About 15 minutes after I finished I started to feel zoned out. I felt relaxed and warm. But these effects were not strong and nothing from a buzz came to me. I felt tired so laid in bed for 15 minutes and called my friend. Then feeling really mellow I played some video games and blasted Bob Dylan. This was great I spent about a hour singing to Dylan and just enjoying music. I still felt relaxed and mellow but then went to the beach nontheless ...

my 'Buzz' (I wouldnt call it that) wore off in the car and the rest of the day I felt tired and zoned out and quiet. I later played some golf. I have a bad temper and usually will scream swing and club in anger and curse but none of this happend at all during my round. I was just too chilled and relaxed. In the end Lotus is a somewhat nice herb but I'm debating if its worth the price and taste... In my opinion its kinda like damiana but I drink damiana cause of its nice taste. I will be expiramenting with it more and will probaly use it with some alchohal to increase the effects.

peace and love
