One night, on a whim, a friend and I decided to ingest a substantial dose of nutmeg, after hearing of its psychedelic potential from two other friends.  Using store-brand ground nutmeg, we each ingested about three or four heaping spoonfuls of the fragrant powder.  I found the taste of nutmeg to be quite unpleasant, and to this day the scent of the spice makes me feel queasy.

Shortly after ingesting the nutmeg, my friend and I felt excited and loose.  I suspect that this was essentially a placebo effect.  I waited around my friend's apartment for about an hour, hoping the effects of the nutmeg would set in, but gave up and returned home.  I waited up for an hour or more at home, in case something set in, but I gave up and went to sleep.  My friend did the same.

I awoke early in the morning to a very disorienting sensation which I can only liken to a very intense hangover.  The morning light seemed extremely harsh and unpleasant, and I had a difficult time negotiating my way into the bathroom, where I tried to determine how exactly I was feeling.  

I have had numerous experiences with different types of drugs, including psychedelics, with very pleasurable effects.  In this case, however, what I was experiencing was nothing of the sort.  

I felt very sick, and threw up about three times.  A common case of the flu might be likened to the sensations I experienced, except that in this case I was more aggressively and unpleasantly disoriented.  

In short, this was absolutely no fun, but in fact one of the more unfortunate experiences I can recall.  

My friend, on the other hand, later told me that he had a very good experience.  He likened it to having eaten marijuana and woken up the next day stoned (he swears by this method although I have never been successful eating pot raw).  In general, he told me he felt 'stoned all day,' and didn't vomit or want to crawl under a moving truck the way that I did.
