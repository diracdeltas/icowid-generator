Current time 4:10pm

At 10:30 am this morning I began to grind and consume what would be 10 nutmeg nuts. I put 1 ½ nuts into hot water and milk with lots of sugar. I began to drink it. It was disgusting. It wasn't so much the taste that I couldn't stand just the feeling that I was going to throw up a few seconds after it reached my stomach. With this method of ingestion I decided to ‘bomb' the rest of the nutmeg (wrap the powder in rolling papers and swallow them like capsules).

10:30 am to 12:30 PM Wednesday- ground nutmeg and ‘bombed' it. Total 5 nuts.

12:45 PM- used Internet to see other people's nutmeg experiences and the amounts they took. Decided have more nuts.

1:15 PM to 3:25 PM- ground and consumed more nuts. Total 10 nuts.

3:30 PM- no change. Decided to watch TV.

3:50 PM- started to feel slightly stoned. Light sinking feeling. Decided to write up experience so far.

4:10 PM- started writing. Now feel very stoned- like ive had a 2/3 spliffs. No nausea. Eyes not red.

4:15 PM- quite difficult to concentrate. Mind feels blank.

5:45 PM- just been for a walk. Almost got hit by a bus. Getting very hard to write.

6:25 PM- Feel VERY VERY stoned. Very difficult to write. Eyes turning red. Will definitely use as a weed substitute.

9:25 PM- hard to keep my balance. Feels like my heads floating off the rest of my body. I walked my girlfriend to her bus stop (she was going to work). I couldn't tell how far away she was from me. Feel tired. Feels quite trippy. Better than MJ buzz. Felt a bit it intense at times. Walked into a few lampposts and bins.

10:00 PM- very clear closed eye visuals rapidly changing into different things (mostly geometrical).

8:00 am Thursday- woke up in bed. Can't remember much before I fell sleep. Still feel very stoned.

9:00 PM- still feeling stoned and very relaxed. Keep having very clear memories from my childhood that make me feel VERY comforted and warm.

1:15 PM Friday- feel a lot more normal. Still a little stoned though. Feel lazy and occasionally dizzy when I stand up.
