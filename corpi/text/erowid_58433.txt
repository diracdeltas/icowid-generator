[Erowid Note: 
Most Coricidin contains CPM (Chlorpheniramine Maleate) which can be dangerous in high doses. See <a href='/chemicals/dxm/dxm_info2.shtml'>DXM Brand Warnings for more info.] 

I an on probation and periodically my probation officer performs a drug test. One such time, my girlfriend and I had been tripping Coricidin Cough and Cold the night before. A friend had assured us it was safe because drug tests don't look for DXM. We both took sixteen pills.

My test came back positive for PCP. I had been sick so I claimed I had been taking too much to try to get better quicker and that I had no idea why my cold medicine was coming up as PCP but I was unable to convince her. She placed me in a weekly drug treatment that I am expected to pay for.
