Last night I tried melatonin for the first time, largely out of curiosity.  I have had a history of sleep problems, and while I've found diphenhydramine to be helpful in inducing sleep, it has often left me feeling less than great the next morning.  Melatonin is another deal entirely.  The process of falling asleep feels incredibly natural, as though no drugs had been consumed (I suppose this makes sense as this is a natural chemical produced by the brain).  Waking up in the morning felt just as good.  But this is not even the beginning of why melatonin amazed me so much. 

What is truly amazing about melatonin is the dream state it induces.  Incredibly vivid lifelike dreams delighted my neurological passageways throughout the night as I explored my own mind.  Never before have I had such wonderful visions play out in my head, be they natural or chemically induced.  I dare say that my dreams far surpassed my experiences with psychedelics.  I was skeptical of melatonin's reported dream enhancing capabilities before I tried it, but no more. This is truly an amazing substance.  So amazing, in fact, that I do not particularly care what side effects may occur from using it.
