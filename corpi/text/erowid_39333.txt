I am 15, when my uncle died of ms, I was in his hospital room. After his heart stopped beating, my family got very upset and left the room. During this time I snagged a bunch of hydromorphone syringes, which already had 2 mgs in it ready to mainline. I am currently on probation, and I was at the time. I was arrested for a non drug offense, so I wasn't given any extensive drug tests. I was just randomly tested for common drugs, including opiates. 

I used one syringe 2 days before I was tested at school, and I thought I was fine reading about how it didn't show up on basic tests. Well I got violated for using heroin/codeine/opium and I didn't know what to say. I was put in detention for 5 days.
