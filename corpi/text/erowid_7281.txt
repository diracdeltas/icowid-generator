This past May, I went to a house party with 100 or so people.

There, I met up with my friends. P had recently purchased 5g of Moroccan hash, which he had smuggled over from Italy.  I had bought a dime of really good weed. P, I, and several others gathered in a circle.  We threw the hash (.3g) on a nugget. We each got 3 hits.  Right after, I put a larger nug in the bowl, with .5g of hash.

We proceeded to smoke it through the same beautiful glass bowl. I remember putting one more nug in and some more hash, but for some reason I don't remember anything for a half hour after that.

I remember floating indoors. Everbody was illuminated by crazy red neon lines.  Everything looked 'squiggly.' The earth had been torched like the Last Temptation of Christ.

I was tremendously scared, as I was being given a serious perspective on life, spirituality, etc. and I was just intending to party!

I went and laid down on a leather couch.  I felt a generous warmth from everybody. People I hated and had conflicts with prior to this experience became friends. Compassion 'resin'-ated through out my body.

I was embarassed, as it had curtailed any of my masculine tendencies. For the first time I grabbed the essence of life, no matter how cliche it may sound. There was a meta-physical quality to it.  I understood everything that condradicted our Western understanding of things. Simple order, cause and effect meant nothing.  From that point on, I lived knowing that there are whole other worlds and perceptions that await cerebrally- life without psychoactive effects is only one dimension. I have been increasingly interested in other drugs that offer something to contemplate, unlike most weed.
