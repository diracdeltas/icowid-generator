Saturday. I became convinced that the mushrooms are actually portals to a more intense and solid consciouness.  I experienced the essence of birth and creation.  I again practiced the tai chi boxing but this time, instead of healing my body (that happened last time) my body, mind, and spritual connection felt very powerful yang energy.  Male, powerful, forceful.  I saw that it acts against what is dark and that the tai chi energy boxing is a remedy against evil in all its forms.  It heals the body and the mind and allows the eternal spirit to cleanse the darkness with light.  The dark had no remedy for this power.  The darkness was constantly tricked by the power of the light.  When an obstacle would present itself I became insubstantial (yin) only, AT THE SAME TIME to appear behind the darkness and drive it away.

There was, and is, no doubt in my mind that the mushrooms are, indeed, magical and that they are portals to universal experience, understanding, and wisdom.

Of course, don't forget, I took quite a few of these little buggers, but, yes, it worked.
