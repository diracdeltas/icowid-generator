Lovingly I take them up and fuse them with my soul,
the medicine picks me up and slowly takes me home,
it lets me view what's really there, all eyes open to absorb and stare, 

I take it in as normalcy twists and warps and falls away,
gone now the horror that plagued my life from day to day,
only truth and beauty left, the little ones demand respect,
permanently and forever more the key they offer has destroyed the door,

Completely free of my former chains, I soar thru my conscious with much to gain, love and warmth bathe my mind, a cleansing process that's all too kind, here is where I want to be, a life without hate, or ignorance, or babylon is one we all need,

Now quietly close your eyes and see with your brain,
travel to your special place there's nothing there to cause you strain, here your soul has room to move, happy and bounding free,
jumping over big blue mountains, swimming thru an electric orange sea,

Their job is done they're leaving you,
don't be sad they love you too;
All things flow accordingly,
understand and you'll stay free.
