After having read many reports about 'make it yourself' drugs I decided to try nutmeg. Now, keep in mind that I had never used any hallucinogen before, so I wasn't sure what was gonna happen or if I was gonna freak.

First off, it tastes like shit. This has been said by many before, but it is REALLY bad. I took it at around 5 PM becuase I knew the onset took about 5 hours. After a few hours, I couldn't focus on broad subjects, but I could keep amazing concentration on singular things. Nothing in reality distorted, just things like patterns seemed much more interesting.

Well it hit midnight, and all I had was the interest in small things and a feeling of being very tired. I conked out, and slept for a while. I woke up once during the night, and when I looked up at my wall, there was a bright blue band of light going up it. Now, this was my first hallucination EVER, and it scared me a bit, so I closed my eyes. After I opened them again, everything was normal.

The next day, I was tired the entire time and my eyes were bloodshot as hell. Past that, nothing happened. That night, I woke up in the middle of the night again. This time, I looked down at my arm and it seemed to be traveling away from me along with the bed. This time, I know it wasn't real, so I decided to savor it. The second I blinked, everything returned to normal again.

After that, nothing else happened. All told, because of having to down the shit, and the minimal effects, it really doesn't seem worth it. If you really plan to trip, get some acids or shrooms.
