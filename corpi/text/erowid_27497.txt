About 24 hours ago, I smoked 6 hits of dried Oxacan leaf. This was my 5th time with Salvia, having tried quids of 10 dried leafs, and 4 homegrown freshly picked leafs and 16x extract several times. I had threshold effects with the 10 leaf quid, which was also my latest episode with Salvia.

So last night I smoked, and felt threshold with the first bowl. I kept on smoking, and finished the 6th hit about 10 minutes later. I had some intense visual disortion, feeling that my room was tumbling around, but not the 'trip' that I was hoping for.

After about an hour I went to sleep, and the first thing I noticed when I woke up at 10 or so was I still had some minor effects. This concerned me some, as I know Salvia isn't supposed to last for more than 2 hours or so. I continue to have minor disortions (ie while reading a book, the words started flowing towards the bottom of the page). So now, a day later, I am still seeing these sorts of things. I am a little worried that I might have permantly messed myself up.

Note: I am on abuterol, singular, adviar (all asthma medicines), and eairler in the day I had taken a Vitamin C and another all purpose vitamin pill.
