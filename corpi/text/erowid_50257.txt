Being on the methadone program for so many years, I've come to the conclusion I'm on it for life. Basically ball and chained to it but the good part of being on it is I'm not getting arrested for heroin possession I cant say my life is perfect actually far from it but my wife helps me through all the fucked up times lately. She is my 2nd wife, I lost my 1st wife from lying about my very expensive heroin habit regardless that she was beautiful and an angel in my eyes the drugs became my first love. No I regret it but my past is done and my new girl is a little fucked up in the head I still love her and she really knows what's best for me. So to all of you addicts wanting to try heroin stop it ruins your life. I just found out that I might have h.i.v. this is the end result of the addiction. That's all I have to say for now.
