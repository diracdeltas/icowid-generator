Unfamiliar with the very low toxicity of vitamin B-6, I consumed one 100mg B-6 tablet and one 3mg melatonin tablet at around 9:30 one night, hoping to attain more restful sleep and re-set my circadian rhythm after a long break from school. I found it extremely difficult to sleep and awoke early in the morning with numbness in my extremities and a headache that did not subside until the following afternoon.
