I had left school early one day with a bullshit story of headaches. And since i complain about them constantly, my mom wanted to take me to the doctor to see what was up. I went just tomake it look like i really was sick. It turned out i had a Sinus infection. They gave me Anti Biotics and Tylenol 3's (30 mg Codeine & 300 mg Acetaminophen each) for the headaches. I knew about how people use tylenol 3's to drink and relax and stuff. I sold six pills to my neighbor for $10 and she told me how to take them if i wanted to get really fucked up. 

The next day at my friends birthday party i decided to take some and see what they would do. I took 2 pills and after 10 min of not feeling anything i took 2 more. about 10 min after that i started to feel heavy and tingly. My legs felt like they wanted to fall but i felt muscle tension, like i was fighting to stand up. But i wasn't. about 20 mins later....all i could do was lay on the floor and look at the ceiling stuck to the floor. i couldn't move. I was completely happy and my hearing was blocked. Nothing hurt and i was pretty much numb. I felt like i was blacking out then coming back to conciousness constantly. Everything was blurry and the only thing i could see was directly in ront of my eyes. Everything else around me was a black blur. If i turned it would be black, then focus and everything would still be blurry. I was in my on little world. For about an hour and a half this went on. 

It was allright...if u have absolutely nothing to do. NO hallucinations and no stoned feeling.  Just a feeling of displacement from the world.
