I have been trying to conceive a child although I am nearly 46. It was apparent that I was not ovulating, but after taking 75 mg per day of DHEA for two and a half months, ovulation has resumed. It also has eliminated all symptoms of PMS, including vicious mood swings. 

I did get a horrible headache for the first two weeks of taking it.
