The night started normally, me and my associate T looking for a way to get fucked up. We got offered some klonopins on a pill hunt and took up the offer, bad decision...?  So we're chilling and we each pop 2 K2s as we leave the guys house. We decide liquor, weed, and klonopins are a good mix for tonight.

READ: NOT A GOOD MIX. NOT FOR ANY NIGHT.

We bought 3 fifths of Mad Dog 20/20, a hard wine. Proceeded to eat the rest of our Kpins, drink some wine, got more and more fucked up. By 8 o'clock things are taking a turn for the worst, I've carved up my legs with a straight razor, and started throwing chairs around my house and screaming at the other occupants. I got in a fight with my  dad, broke his rib, his knuckles, and tried to get various family members to stab me. Result: Me, J - in a rehab facilty for a week or so.

Money well spent? Probably not.

I should not have fucked with liquor and benzos. They turned my life upside down and mugged that bitch, and I don't even remember meeting them.
