This experience is meant for diabetics.  As a diabetic, I thought it would be a good idea to know what effects drugs will have on my before I take them.  However, I couldn't find any information.  So I took it and now I have experience to share.  So this one is for all those curious, reckless diabetics.

I've taken DXM three times now.  Each time I have increased the dosage; first at about 250 mg, next at about 340, and the last time, up to 370 or so.  I'm a diabetic, and have therefore been very careful (relatively speaking of course-I'm a dysfunctional human being after all) each time I've taken it.  My experience deals not so much with the effects of the drug on my mind as on my body.  As a diabetic, I've wondered what effects new drugs will have on my blood sugar, and metabolism as a whole.  DXM, like other psychodelic drugs, seems to shut down my metabolism for a short time.  

Even after eating sugar, in starburst form, my blood sugar doesn't necessarily rise within a half hour as it normally does.  My simple, but maybe wrong, reasoning accounts for this: DXM is a poison, and perhaps my body stops metabolising 'food' once the poison has entered into my metabolic equation.  I'm pretty sure that it digests the food, it's just a matter of whether or not the sugar makes it to my blood stream, and consequently my brain and body.  In any case, my experience is that taking food doesn't have it's normal effect of increasing my blood sugar.  

For this reason I like to walk into the trip with my blood sugar on the high side.  Although this has bad long term effects on my body, I deem the short-term safety to be worth it.  Once the DXM has been metabolised, sugar that I'd previously eaten does raise my blood sugar; it just seems to be delayed.  So there you have it.
