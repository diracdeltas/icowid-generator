My partner and I received a friendly care package from Holland and tried this out one fine evening and late into the night. I took 2.5 and he took 4 little (8 mg) pills.

I should state that our focus in working with Medicine is first and foremost personal growth, ie. insights, clearing out debris from the past, move to a higher level of awareness and functioning in our lives and in our relationship. Liberation and Enlightenment.

The first few hours were not much fun, slight body discomfort, mostly in the GI tract but nothing major, and otherwise nothing much of interest. 

By the fourth hour and onward we had ruthless clarity in communication. Each of our minds was like an impartial and dispassionate judge or shrink, no messing around, no fuss, no emotions, just pure brilliantly clear exposing of whatever needed any clarification. No fear of hurting the other with truth. Just laying it all out.

We covered a vast territory, all aspects of our relationship to each other, to friends and clients, everything came under perfect scrutiny.

We decided that this might be a good thing about once a year, to take stock and make sure that nothing is left hidden or unresolved.

I was actually surprised how much work can be done just using this laser clear mind. I tend to feel(!) that involving the emotions and the body itself are crucial for inner work. So, got one of my little myths popped!
