After running out of Klonopin which I usually use help to get to sleep, I decided to seek out natural alternatives. I had read online that combining Melatonin, vitamin B6, and Valerian would produce the most vivid of dreams.  I've been interested in dreaming for as long as I've been alive and this intrigued me.  From what I've learned, people dream every night, whether they remember it or not.

Melatonin absolutely allows me to remember my dreams better than without.  The order of events, sounds, colors are completely available for recall when I awake.  I could write for a half hour about my dreams when I take melatonin before I sleep, while normally I can sometimes remember only bits and pieces. The sensations that I experience while dreaming are unlike anything I could adequately put into words. While the dreams are not what I'd call lucid dreams, they are extremely vivid, and simply different.  I experience, or remember rather, sensations that are so intense it makes dreaming a treat.

As for Vitamin B6 and Valerian - while they don't seem to inhibit the effect of melatonin, they certainly aren't necessary.  I've tested that numerous times.
