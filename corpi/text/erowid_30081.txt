Artificial intelligence. Thats what we call 2-AI around here.. After reading all the hyped up reports we bought 10G only to be dissapointed with oral and intranasal use. Recently reports of IV use of 2-AI emerged. Only having minor prior experience with the needle I decided to use it in my muscle rather than vein. I weighed out 100mg of the powder and seperated it into two piles. The powder readily dissolved in .2 CC's of distilled water. Next I shot it into the side of my leg. 

About 10-15 minutes later I was very impressed with the effects. A very nice stimulation and pleasant state of mind soon began. My mouth dried up and I had a tight feeling in my chest, that is characteristic of my bodies reaction to amphetamines. I had a 3 hour car ride ahead and it made it enjoyable. This is apparently the best way to administer 2-AI. Little to no comedown or after effects. 

I found 40mg orally to produce too much anxiety. 20mg intranasal produced little if no effects.
