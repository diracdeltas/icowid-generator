I don't drink often so 4 deuces is a lot of beer and gets me really drunk. I'm 18 years old and 6'4', but before I start the report I need to mention the events previous to the trip. I take a multivitamin everyday along with a few other supplements, ginkgo biloba, st johns wort, and kava kava. I recently ran out of 5-htp and had not been taking that. I had worked all morning, then when I got out of work i relaxed with some beer. I drank a good amount, and was quite drunk. At this point I always stop drinking, but I then decided I'd try blowing a tiny dose (5mg) of Iprocin (4-HO-DiPT). After I blew the iprocin, nothing happened. 5 minutes later, and then it hits me like a train. Tryptamines and alcohol don't combine... I remembered this too late. I was in an alcoholic haze when I decided to take the small dose and it didn't occur to me. I should've been more careful I could've wound up dead. 

So the iprocin hits me, I'm seeing the rainbows and color patterns everywhere like iprocin always causes, except the buzz is just so strong. I was getting cold chills all over my body like i was being submerged in ice or hot lava from the top down. I started to have a hard time breathing, I was gasping for air.. I decided it would be best if I went down the street to my friends house. this is about 20 minutes after taking the iprocin. We smoked a little bowl and this calmed me down, but I was obviously under control of the powerful drug iprocin. I can't say I really remember too much of what happened, but it did get hard to breath. 

I have never literally 'passed out' before, but I actually did about an hour after doing the iprocin.
