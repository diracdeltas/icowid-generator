I was waiting in the emergency room for my appendicitis surgery, rolling in pain. And when I asked the nurse for a painkiller, she brought me a shot, and told me that that was fentanyl. Right after the shot, as soon as the cold feeling going up my vein was done, I felt an IMMENSE wave of calmness coming over me, and dragging me away from the agonizing pain. That calmness was so intense, that right away I was not only virtually pain free, but also so relaxed, that I could not imagine doing anything better then roll over, and close my eyes.

At first it was the same sweet feeling, as when you go to sleep after forcing yourself to stay up way too long, but soon enough I realized that instead of slipping into a sleep, I am dreaming, but still awake, as in I was able to hear everything happening around me, and (at least I thought so) I could force myself to react to it. The dream, was a normal, night time dream, that I could not recall an hour after waking up from that state, but it was very vivid, as I was drifting between being almost totally immersed in the dream reality, to coming back to more or less normal state of mind, depending on my thoughts - if I was thinking about hospital/operation/doctor I would start hearing, and generally being more aware of my surroundings, and I would let my mind run off, I would go deeper into my dream. This state lasted approximately for half an hour, maybe 45 minutes. After that, I went back to reality, but the pain did not return for anout 2.5 hours after that.

All in all, this was by far my most pleasant experience with opiates and opiods (I have done codeine and morphine numerous times recreationally), and this has prompted me to consider taking some oxycontin while I'm recovering from the surgery, to reexperience that great wave, without the guilt of playing with a potentially addictive substance.
