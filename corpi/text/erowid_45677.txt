A couple of weeks back I bought a bunch of herbal spliffs. Many of them were useless and didn't really do much, however amongst them, one of them was Calea zacatechichi AKA 'Dream Stix'

I wasn't too confident that much was going to happen, as much didn't seem to happen with the others. However I did have to get rid of it at one point or another, so after reading up on Erowid, I decided to go out at around 12am into my back garden and light up.

I smoked it for about 20 minutes before the terrible bitter taste got the better of me. I decided that if it did work I'd get some more next time and getting rid of the unfinished spliff wouldn't be such a big deal.

I proceeded inside with a glass of water and some mints to get rid of that awful taste. Got into bed, didnt really feel any different. Eventually got to bed around half 1.

Now so far nothing had happened, but then at an early time in the morning (possibly 6am) when it was still a bit dark, i woke up, i don't know why, i just did, i quickly went to sleep right after and thats when all the dreams started.

I can remember about 3 different dreams in total. Many of them seem clear and sharp. All my dreams had some kind of conflict going on, with either arrows or guns with zombies, ice people, spies, Britney Spears, monkeys and Kung foo sorcerors on flying carpets. Like all of my dreams, I was unaware that I was in a dream.

I woke up not long ago (10:15am)  as I am writing this, and I am pleased with my experience. However I think next time (and im sure there will be a next time) i'll try making a tea out of it with a pleasant taste. 

Overall my general feeling is that im surprised that it worked, my expectations were low but now Calea is a favoured herb and I hope to have more experiences in the future with it.
