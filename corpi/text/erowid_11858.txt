I recently came across 70g of T. Peruvianus and decided to try it out.  Being my first time I chewed only 15g of the material (yuck) just to see what it would do.  Surprisingly (to me anyway) I had a fairly nice trip.  Most of the day I drove around doing random things I needed to do.  About 6 hours into it I found out that pot REALLY sets that stuff off.  At this dose I didn't really have many visual distortions, but everything took on a cartoon'ish glow and the body sensations were VERY nice. Overall a very positive trip.

A week later I decided to take the remaining 55g (yea, nearly 4x the amount), but this time I bought a coffee grinder and put it all in pills (130 pills).  

10:00am – Here we go… I start taking the pills 3 at a time in 2 minute intervals.  

11:00am – I've eaten about 50% of the pills.  I feel a little odd in the stomach area, but nothing major.  I haven't eaten in about 14 hours, so that's helping.  I found out the last time that drinking orange juice is a BAD idea… just comes right back up.  I think I'm feeling the first effects… lets smoke a bowl and see what happens.  I end up doing this about 3 or 4 times throughout the day at random intervals.

12:00pm – Definitely feeling it.  I keep forgetting to eat more pills, but that's probably the pot.  I'm getting that nice body buzz again, one of the more noticeable effects right now.  Everthing looks more interesting now.

1:00pm – Finished eating the pills about half an hour ago.  Everything is getting more of a glow to it.  My friend J showed up a little after noon to see how I'm doing.  

1:30pm? – Time is becoming difficult to deal with.  We go pick up his new ski's… riding around town is surreal.  I can still tell I'm there, but I'm not sure how.  When we get back I go to the toilet and relieve the remaining cactus from stomach… much nicer now.

4:00pm – We watch Fear and Loathing… very odd movie.  J drives me out to get some food. MY GOD, where am I?  This looks vaguely like the town I remember, but I can't convince myself it's real.  It looks like one of those scenes out of an animated cartoon movie where they sometimes use computer generated scenery… it still looks like a cartoon, but a little too perfect.  Still no real visual distortions, but it's like everything I'm seeing is just a vision in my head.  Playing a computer game is just as "real" as reality now.

5:??pm – I don't exactly know why, but I heard a voice in my head say "Nitrous".  I thought, "wow,  that would be nice… hey wait, I have some!"  Two balloons and a comfortable chair.  I look up before the launch and see that things are starting to move more now.  That's crazy, 7+ hours into the trip and I'm just NOW starting to see visuals?  I'm also tripping harder than any time earlier today.  3… 2… 1…  Blast-off!

OMG, that was amazing.  I don't even know how to describe it… I just went away… no room, no me, no anything… I probably could have moved, but I'd have to figure out how first.

9:00pm – Um, I'm still tripping harder… is this going to stop?  I took a few more nitrous hits earlier, each better than the one before.  The walls are moving around, but not like lsd.  This is smoother and slower… much more natural feeling.  Thought attempts itself, but fails, my body is pulsing, yet I am at peace.  

12:00am – I felt the ending of the peak around 10pm, but I'm still in it.  What a day it's been.  I try to sleep, but fail… still wide-awake at 2am… I manage to fall asleep somewhere between 4am-6am.

I'm so happy to have had this opportunity.  Mescaline has become my drug of choice.  When I look back on all my previous drug experiences (lsd, dpt, salvia, etc) they all seem either artificial or just something to do when I can't find anything better.  I feel as though I've been searching for the "right" drug, and I've finally found it… I'm not even in a hurry to do it again.  I've seen the holes in my life, I've seen who and why I am me… everything makes sense… I feel complete.
