It seems that some people seem to have some problems or strange ideas as to how to smoke cannabis oil.

In New Zealand one of the most common ways of smoking pot is referred to as 'spotting', using the element of a kitchen stove in combination with knives.  I believe this is referred to as 'hot-kniving' in other parts of the world.

The best type of knives to use have non-metal handles.  Bone-handled knives work well, but be careful to not let the handle touch the element, otherwise you'll have a small fire-show in your kitchen :)

Turn the element on to full power (this works best with gas or spiral-metal elements) and place the knive as hard against this as possible.  Sometimes a round piece of metal (such as the top of a coffee tin) is used as a hat on top, however this is usually somewhat excessive for Oil.  It usually takes 5-10 mins for the elements to heat up properly (significantly longer with gas)

Take a small blob of oil and place it on the end of a needle.

You will also require some kind of tube for sucking up the smoke, I would suggest making a makeshift 'straw' out of the top of packet of cigarette papers or something similar.

Place the straw in your mouth, and with the other hand pull out the red-hot knife from under the element.  Move the straw towards the end of the knife and begin inhaling slowly.  With your other hand place the blob of oil onto the knife and rub it up and down a little bit.  The oil should bubble a little bit then 'poof' the smoke out.  Make sure you're inhaling a little faster for when it starts smoking.

It can take a few attempts to master the timing. But, with a small amount of practise, you can achieve near-perfect 'spots' with almost no wastage at all.

It may be easier to get a friend to do the burning (driving) for you, while you concentrate on sucking up all the smoke.
