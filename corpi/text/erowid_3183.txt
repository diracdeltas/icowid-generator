There was a great rave happening about 90k's out'a town, in a valley (middle of nowhere) so me and some of my friends had decided that we would go. I had been working about 9 hours that day and was a little bit tired so I decided that I neede a little bit of help to stay awake. Wnt to the local pharmacy and bought some of this stuff called 'Vig' wich has a combo of Guarana, Ginseng, and Ginko. The packet said to take about 2 a day but I thought 'what the hell, I'm tired!' so I took about 7 an hour beore arriving at the site. 

Once there, in the tradition of things I had quite a bit of vodka and then there's a gap of about 30 minutes where I don't remeber too much. The next thing I knew, I was sitting down on one of the hills amongst the crowd to just listen to the goovy muzac...I was very decently trashed on the vodka by then but suddenly things started spinning sound like the whole planet was in fast forward and that really freaked me out so I stood up as quickly as possible and the spinning stopped after a few minutes. It was then that I felt 'awake' while being drunk...not really sure how to describe it...kind'a felf a little invincible and although my motor skills weren't all that good my mental condition was brilliant. I decided to dance for a short while...6 hours later I was still going at it without a single break. I was amazed so I went to my friend's tent to tell him of what I was experiencing. He was not there so I thought I'd have a lie down and went out like a rock. 

About 3 hours later I woke with the a very calm but very rich euphoric feeling. ALL the alcohol had left my blood, or at least it felt like it did and I felt absolutely at peace with everything for the rest of the day, like I could never be sad or upset. Never repeated the experience so I don't know what it really was.
