Dalmane Flaurazepam

I have a chronic sleep disorder. My medication, DALMANE works perfectly fine if taken before sleep. But I decided to experiment today what might arise if I spread its use throughout the day. On previoius occations I have had light hallucinations and physical dissorientation. In small doses, 30mg to 60mg. Now I have reached 150mg and am having incredibly mind altering affects. I feel as though I am dreaming, completely detached from reality. Objects and lights before me are constantly changing hue and shape. The visual distortions continue to grow in intensity. I'm feeling somewhat creative and thinking I'll be working on my new album tonighit...if I dont' fall asleep first.

I could see<!--This experience isn't for everyone --> the disorientation and inabiility to speak correctly becoming very annoying. 

I'm also taking Celexa, and anti-depressent, I've noticed when these are mixed my comprehension of reality continues to dwindled, and I sometimes become very paranoid of appearing really fucked up, even though its clearly not that easy to tell.
