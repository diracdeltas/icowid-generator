I'm an 18 year old college student. I live in a dorm on my campus and consider myself to have pretty good knowledge of drugs. Thats why I was amazed to find to find that this small campus had a drug that I had never heard of before. I come from a big city and I've done it all but never anything like this. 

I got these white pills from a guy down the hall in exchange for some stuff that I had. The guy told specifically 'split this capsule in half, this is strong shit!'. Well, I was thinking yeah right, I'm 6'5' 220 pounds I can handle one of these pills. So I waited till I had a free night and took it. About 2 hours later at a soroity party it hit me. I did alright for a while. Then about an hour into it I lost all cordination. My head was pounding and I was hearing crazy sounds with bad visuals. 

A couple of my friends took me upstairs to a room to smoke out. The room was tiny and I lost it after 2 bowls. I couldn't get down the steps. My friend carried me to his girlfriend's truck and drove me back to my dorm. I couldn't see, walk, or hear. He carried me up the stairs and put me im my bed. For what seemed like the next six hours I heard the door open and close. I had no motor skills at all and was babling about being stuck in midget land. When I woke up the next morning I was happy to be alive. Be warned this is a powerful drug. It is a ten times more powerful than the best acid I've eaten. Listen to your supplier. Only eat a little.
