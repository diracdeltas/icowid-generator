I was sitting in my friends basement at about 3 o'clock pm with my bong which we packed up with a vial of wet i had bought earlier that day.  The vial was equivalent to a nick or a 5 bag of grass.  The bong was smoked between only my brother and I, and before we were even half finished I felt the effects.  At first, I noticed that my hearing was different and I believed I could hear everything except for what I was saying.  In only a couple minutes the rest of it kicked in.

I tried to walk around the room and realized that it was extremely hard to do.  I could barely see anything but I could hear almost every single noise that anyone made.  Mentally, I thought that there wasn't a yesterday or a tomorrow, and that it was the end of the world. The effects lasted well until 10 o'clock pm.

I know that people would react to these feelings in different ways.  Honestly, I'm a fan of dark feelings and I loved it, but I also know that these feelings could cause some people to 'bug out'. Take my word that if you're a person that enjoys happy highs, you shouldn't even think of tryin wet or any other kind of PCP.  If you would enjoy this kind of stuff, I'm not trying to persuade or dissuade you to try it, but I must warn that you shouldn't do too much of it in a little amount of time.  Thats how one of my friends ended up in a mental institution.  So be careful with wet and PCP.
