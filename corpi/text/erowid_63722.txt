So, I went out to my local club scene and took what I thought to be a pill of MDMA, my friend told me it was a newer brand from Denmark(the usually have safer stuff). This pill was not like any I had seen before, it was white with a small I stamped on it, after ingesting it I soon realised this was no MDMA being familiar with the effect of MDMA. I did some research and came across these new drugs popping up all over the world with a 2C-B like name the street name differs from place to place, this was 2C-I, I guess, not to say the trip wasn't enjoyable.

Dangerous or not the vivid hallucinations and almost stimulating effect was a very enjoyable buzz, lasted for about ten hours before I went to sleep.
