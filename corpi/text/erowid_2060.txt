Well, I'm a frequent pot smoker and I've tripped a few times on acid and shrooms and I've Ecstasy and other natural drugs well, here is my heavenly Blue MG experience.

I went to Kmart and about 8 1.8gm packs of Heavenly Blue Morning Glorys

I promptly went home and grinded all 8 packs in a fast 4 hours! after that (I did not follow the FAQ for the precedure to rid it of all the shit that makes you sick) I soaked it in 1 1/2 cups of water for 2 1/2 hours i downed the shit colored water in 2 gulps (UGH!) at about 8pm I didnt really feel anything till about 9pm and that was only *minor* stuff (ie, my face looked just a *little* funy in the mirror, not like acid and my faces looks scary!) I waited till (:30 pm and didnt feel much more, and I was tried cuz I hadnt slept the night before, so I feel alseep. at 11:30 pm I woke up cuz my feet kept tingling. (you know that feeling when you trip on acid how your body sorta tingles) wel, IT WAS DRIVING ME CRAZY!!! it was like an irriating tingle, not pleasureable at all. I still didnt feel all that fuck up (except for the dry heeves). I feel like I had taken about 1/2 hit of weak acid. Well, before I knew it it was 3am and my buzz wore off, but it didnt end there. For the next week, I felt like I had the FLU, but it wasnt the FLU, and for that week, my shit was REAL RUNNY!!! (in fact, (not to be disgusting or anything I'm just letting you know what happened) my shit was just shit colored water, there were not actuall soldi matter in my shit, it sounded like I was pissing out my ass) this lasted for a week! and man did i have to shit often!!!

Well, that basically sums it up, I didnt get off that well, and the 'side effects' were very unpleasant.

I dont know if I want to try it again, but I probaly will in the summer time, but the next time (if there is one) I will be sure to follow the FAQ exactly! and I advise you 2 too if you are going to do this, otherwise you will have a bad thought about MG after you do it.
