This is my first time to dose i was so excited. my friends offer me some DOC and im thinking hell yea im gonna trip. so i ask how much im taking and they tell me about 8 hits and i asked is that normal and they said yes. so i ate the 7 hits that were 2mgs each. 
 
Upon the first hour my friends and I were sitting around smoking waiting for a psychedelic adventure we never forgot to begin. Amazingly at 30 minutes I start to feel the universe shift is such a way ive never felt before. im in a very comfortable evoirnment with great tunes playin im feeling the best ive ever felt. 
 
Along comes the 2 hour and i begin to think im peaking and my friend says ' Believe me you wont be talking when your peaking'. Then i said i hope so.
 
Hour 5 IM TRIPPIN BALLS!!!!! im trippin so hard i close my eyes and i have kaliedoscopic visions and i open my eyes and its the same thing its incredible. I begin to remeber this trip is goin to be for 30 hours, im in for a BIG surprise.
 
Hour 18  finally back to conciousness, i dont remember what happened for the past 13 hours but i think i figured out the universe in those 13 hours.
 
Hour 20-30  The come down felt like a month. but all we did was smoke our way through it and let the music roll.
