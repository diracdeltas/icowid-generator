waste of saturday

Saturday night, I was grounded, and bored out of my skull around 6 in the afternoon.  My parents weren't going to be home for awhile and I had been waiting to trip on dramamine for quite awhile.  D my tripsitter was there, and I took 7 pills, after drinking a beer, to calm me down before the trip. He was on dxm and having a blast, and I was bored.

I heard the stuff took 2 hours, so I waited (I did eat, and I have heard eating kills the trip, so that might be my problem).  After about 4 hours of nothing but trouble concentrating, drowsiness and cotton mouth, I realized it wasn't going to work.  The one thing I heard was knocking, but it probably was real.

So I went to bed and I think I slept through the trip, or didn't have one.  Might try again with 10 instead.
