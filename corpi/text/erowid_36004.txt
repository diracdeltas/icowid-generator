[Erowid Note: While it may be that the substance described below is MDA, Ecstasy tablets are notoriously impure or misrepresented, often containing chemicals other than those they are presumed to contain. This report is marked as an MDA report, but readers should be aware that this is more of a general Ecstasy report.]  

Last Wednesday was A's day off from work, so the night before he told me to come over to his house. He told me we'd do mushrooms and MDA. When I asked whether or not we had to visit our source he told me he already had 'the supplies'.

I got to A's house around noon on Wednesday, and we were eager to get going. We took each one tablet of 'White Dove', pure MDA, at 12:30. We made some Kool-Aid to help eat the mushrooms. A brought out the bag, which had been around his house for weeks. It contained, we thought, about 10 grams of mushrooms, about a quarter of dust. But when we emptied the bag, we realized there was much more than 10 grams. I estimated there was at least 15 grams. But we had already agreed to split it down the middle, so we began eating.

By 1pm we had eaten most of the mushrooms, though the dust was hard to stomach. Since we knew that mushrooms crushed into dust caused the drug to have its effect very quickly, I was not totally unprepared for what happened next.

We were sitting on the couch watching the TV. I felt the mushrooms very quickly, and by 1:20pm I was being hit extremely hard. The 'flowing' effect was everywhere: on the roof, the floor, the TV, the wall, etc. I had never been hit by mushrooms so hard. Soon I could not focus my eyes properly, and all my thoughts were disturbing. I was, to put it bluntly, 'freaking out'. I let A know that I was in a bad place, but that I thought I could hold out. 

1:40pm (T+1hr Mushrooms): I realize that not all the mushrooms will have been absorbed by my body, and I make a conscious decision to throw up. I let A know and walk to the bathroom. I collapsed in front of the toilet, the drugs now enveloping my whole consciousness. My last willful decision was to lean my head over the toilet bowl. Moments later I am throwing up, and I immediately feel better. I notice that very few mushroom parts came up, but I'm not disturbed. 

I can feel the MDA distinctly now. I wash out my mouth, splash water onto my face and walk back to the couch. A asks if I'm alright, I smile and tell him I surely am. The MDA is fantastic. At this time I give the mix a big thumbs up. The mushroom visuals are still very pronounced and every seems, thanks to the MDA, 'awesome'. I become uncharacteristically talkative. I am seriously enjoying the high now. We watch TV, talk and enjoy the experience for a good three hours. M., A's brother gets home from work and we smoke a few joints together.

At about 4:30 (T+4hrs30mins for the MDA, T+4hrs mushrooms), we realize we have to leave the house, as A's parents will be home from work any minute. A. tells me he's alright to drive, so we take a short ride to a nearby beach with walking trails. We take a trail along the edge of a cliff which leads down in to the lake, and away from other people, of which there are many on this summer day. We walk for about a half-hour. Andy is walking in front of me when he mutters 'Jesus Christ' and jumps ahead a few paces. I take another step and see what disturbed him: a snake, possibly a rattle-snake, slithering off the trail. We walk back to the car, tired and dehydrated from the heat. We drive to a fast-food restaurant. The mushrooms are still affecting us, and the fact that four cops are in the restaurant somewhat disturbs us.

By 6pm both the MDA and the mushrooms are wearing off, though I still have the mood-lift of the MDA for most of the night. We meet another friend later on and smoke some weed. At about 12pm I get home. I have a headache, but I had taken a zopaklon tranquilizer and some advil, and am managing it quite well. I get to sleep well enough, and I feel no effects the next day.


I must say I liked the mix. The MDA totally obliterated the disturbing thoughts I often get with mushrooms and simply makes every fun. I would most certainly do this mix again. One downside is the price: A. treated me this time (much love to him for it!!), but otherwise it would have cost me almost 40 dollars, and drugs are relatively cheap here. Otherwise an excellent drug experience, one I highly recommend.
