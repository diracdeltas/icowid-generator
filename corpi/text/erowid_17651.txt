Last autumn, I took one of these PMA-pills by accident, thinking it was normal MDMA. Being a consumer of leisure-chemicals for four years without EVER having a negative reaction or horror trip, this stuff scared the living shit out of me.

This evening, I´d had a big dinner some hours before, I was (as always) enjoying a perfect health condition and (as an exception) I halved the pill and took the halves after half an hour each. So, I was extraordinarily careful and well-prepared!
This night was the first and last time I ever puked on drugs. One of these pills was enough to make an exception, it MUST be f**king toxic, otherwise I wouldn´t have had such a strong reaction from such a low dose and what a spoilt night! It was just like having a baaad cold! DISGUSTING!

The scary thing about it: One week before, I had a pill with exactly the same Logo (White Elephants) and it was a First-Class-DeLuxe-MDMA-Bonbon. They looked exactly! I just can´t be sure anymore.
