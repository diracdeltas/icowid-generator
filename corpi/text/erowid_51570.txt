Dxm, is one of the strangest drugs that I have ever done. It made me feel like shit at first and than the quad vision starts and I just can't stop moving. This drug made me do the same thing over and over again for example going to my frige and looking for food even tough I already knew there wasent any than I would go to my front door and look outside. I repeated this all nite long, why I don't know. The robo walk it self is in my opinon is the best effect.
