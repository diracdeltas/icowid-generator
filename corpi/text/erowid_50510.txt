First off I wil tell you a little about myself... Im a 15 year old kid who has tried a variety of things. I have used marijuana (almost every day for the past year or so), I smoke ciggarettes, Drink alcohol once in a while and have tried DXM, Nitrous Oxide and Salvia. 

It was about 9:30 when I came across a bottle of hydrocodone syrup. I researched it quickly online and decided to give it a go. I drank about 1/3 of the bottle (which i believe contained approximately 300mL). I went upstairs and immediatley thought to myself and said to the person I was with (Lets call them Q) that it was 'bullshit' and nothing is going to happen. I am a pretty unpatient person... Meanwhile I packed my bong and took about 5 or 6 monster hits. By 10:00 I was feeling pretty fucked up. My head felt like it wasn't attached to my body and it was getting a little difficult to maintain balance. I turned on the TV and watched for a few minutes. At about 10:10-10:15 my legs began to shake uncontrollably and I wasn't able to walk. I somehow got to my bed and laid down... The rest of my body started to shake and it was hard to open my eyes (I wasn't tired yet).  If someone was to see a short 10 second video clip of me they would have said I was having a seizure, thats how bad my legs were spazzing out. I began to get scared and  just tried to stay as still as possible.

The next morning I was having trouble functioning. My legs would randomly jerk and It was still hard to walk. I thought a shower would help but I wound up passing out in the shower and waking up with a mouth full of soapy water. (Im Guessing I was only out 2-5 minutes). I wound up skipping school and sleeping on and off until about 5:00pm the next day. I smoked weed 3 times since then and have experienced the shaking of the legs (but much less severe).<!--I would not reccomend using this to get high. Think about it... if it was that good alot more people would be doing it. Stick with something else-->
