I didnt really know if sleeping pills and pain pills would mix well.  Someone told it it would be ok to take.  

So Ive been popping Viko's for a while.  Its an ok buzz, but I've had it so many times before.  I wanted somthing fresher.  So I decided to pop a Zolpic.  I started drawing and I'm really getting into my picture.  I felt spiritual, making real deep conetcions in my drawing.  This high is was diffrent and unique.  I havent seen any other reports about it thats why I decided to make one.  Its really making me see things from a diffrent point of view, Its really hard to describe what im feeling right now.  I didnt know if these were supppose to mix, but I feel ok.
