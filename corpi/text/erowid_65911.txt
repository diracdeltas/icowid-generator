I take GHB as prescribed by my physician for Narcolepsy.   Narcolepsy is the only approved legal use for the substance GHB (known as Xyrem).    I'm all for having fun and experimenting with drugs.  In fact, when I first got the prescription I was kind of excited I would get a 'buzz' and help my Narcolepsy.   Not the case.    I just want people to know that this is a very very potent drug. Please be very aware of how much you are taking, just a very small amt over optimal can be dangerous.  

I have not had any pleasant experiences with this drug, in fact this drug scares me.   I have had my share of experiences with alcohol, legal, and illegal drugs.   The prescribed dose I took is 3 grams or 6ML twice a night (diluted with water).  Once right before bed and once in the middle of the night.   I've taken the dose an hour or two before bed hoping to get something good out of it, I felt good and tingly for approx. half and hour and then very suddenly dizziness and nausea set in. I have vomited several times after taking this drug and trying to stay awake. I often would not wake up in the middle of the night to take the second dose cause I was out.   This drug will make me sleep (pass out if taken in excess), that is what it is designed to do.   My doctor said it would be fine if I just took the full dose right before bed.  I tried this (a total of 6 grams) and woke up in the middle of the night to pee and was so disoriented and dizzy, I could barely walk.   It would have been very very possible for me to have fallen and hit my head.   I would never take that much of a dose again. 

Obviously the substance I take is pure GHB and the stuff on the street may be diluted or cut with something else.   I would suggest experimenting with other safer drugs, but if you must please start off at a very small dose and be very very mindful of how much you take. If you are looking for an alcohol type high, stick with alcohol.
