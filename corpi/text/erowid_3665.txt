I am an old head. I have not taken large volumes of LSD, as it's potency seems to revolve around your potency. It is the only drug that is impossible to abuse. Respected, it can be dreadfully strong. It operates on your system primarily as a sensory amplifier, when potent, to the point of distortion. 

As a professional musician, I can say that it's Inspirational,but to be respected. When used as a tool to gain advantage over booze and other situations, it is at best extra legs. Over-use leads to depression. The power to trip is in you: LSD is only the catalyst. While you are young, you can dig it the most, it uses up the vitamins and enzymes in your system, which are replaced by time and nutrition. Have respect. Do you see God?.....Of course!!!!!! By opening your eyes wide and gaining empathy with His creation! Do you become God???// No way.  

You must repent. It is not wrong to experience LSD, it is a privledge, and a joy. How can you get tied up in an experience that is only temporary.? By taking what you've learned to the test. That's Life. Love, Stephen
