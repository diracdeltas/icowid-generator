i'm a 31 male transhuman 165lbs 6'2' 6'u reddish/green

i am VERY experienced with all manners of psychedelics

the problem with this trip report is that it so totally blew me away i have a hard time remembering and describing it.

i can usually take 10mg of fox OR 20mg of 4-OH-DiPT and still function pretty well.

manner of ingestion: i just eat it and wash it down with some V8 - there's so little the bad taste is not a big deal. 

well, in THIKAL, shulgin talks about the potential for such as 4-5-methylenedioxy-DiPT and such, he never actually tries them.

IMHO, this was a TRAGIC mistake.

7.5mg of fox + 7.5mg of 4ohdipt was a ++++ on the shulgin scale. total mind blowing religious peak experience. like people experience right before having epilectic seizures, EVERYTHING seem to be impregnated with deep spiritual connections and interconnectivity.

i just can't do much better describing it - i was SO overwhelmed - is was like being in a state of grace and speaking in tongues.

the 7.5+7.5 was a HUGE overdose. they compound are EXTREMELY synergist.

as for setting, i tried to watch X2 and like, found messages from various gods in it - and didn't remember shit about the movie the next day.
