After a hard night of drinking at the local bar, my friend decided to sell me, rather GIVE me some free Effexor.  Little did I know what those 2 little pills held for me.

A day of nausea, sickness, dizziness, headaches, stomach aches, and all around shittiness followed.

If you're reading this wanting to take Effexor, listen to me. Don't do it.
