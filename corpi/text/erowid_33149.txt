Smoking Is Really Stupid

I started smoking when I was 12 because all of my friends did it. 

Now that I am older it's a really embarrassing habit to have, and it comes along with a disgusting, painful cough. I work in an office with 4 other people, none of whom are smokers. I always have to sneak out and smoke, and I come back and stink up the office with cigarette stench. 

I have managed to quit twice but I always pick it right back up after a few months, thinking 'I can have just one'. I have chronic chest pains and my once very mild asthma has intensified at least 10x in the past few years. <!--If you are thinking about smoking for your image or because your friends do it, don't, because it is really not worth it.-->
