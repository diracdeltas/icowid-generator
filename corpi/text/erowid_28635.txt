I decided to order some of Neon Joint's 'Illusion' pills, which claim to contain 4 mg of the substance in topic.  After finally receiving them, me and a few friends started planning the trip.  What were we going to do? Where should we be? The normal questions... When the chosen day finally came, we all gathered in a circle and popped them together.  We waited and waited and waited. Nothing. 
Soon after, I sent the company several emails explaining my situation in a fashion that did not impede on their legal grounds. At last I received a response that said something like, 'I know I'm stupid for doing this, but I'll send you another batch.' They also said that they were having shipping problems and that it may take a while. I waited a month before I started asking them what was going on, but I never got a reply. I was screwed by this company and I want potential consumers to know this.
