Setting: My childhood bed, blankets covering me with a mindfold on and Harold Budd on headphones. 

I took the smoke in about 4 medium tokes and then my friends left the room as I twisted into the other dimension, the DMT space of wonderment. I left from my body into a dimensional time-warp, and in this constant dimension shift I saw thousands of entities bursting out, welcoming me and sharing in the beauty of life, a song of glory. My emotions exploded. I felt mentally sober and aware throughout, despite the worm-hole like journey. I perceived this world from radical perspective shifts, and yelled 'Oh my god, so good, so beautiful!' Twisting, churning; the world burst into multi-colored energy balls and entities. They formed a ball of blue stonish grey, and grabbed at me but as friends, as the same as me. Eventually they slipped away, and I was left with a new type of creature, that had a mostly black face but with colorful features. I felt pokes and tugs but it was not at all bad; they seemed as if they were me, and I knew the goodness of everything; goodness was this space. The music was happy music, and enhanced the experience dramatically. The experience lasted 10 minutes, but seemed so long while I was in it, but so quick when I woke. Some parts I felt neutral when perspectives shifted radically, but never fear. The unexpected was welcome, and after it ended I was sad to have left. I then ran into the backyard and did a flip for the first time in my life (no exaggeration) and landed with elation on my grass. This was my favorite psychedelic experience, and I experienced no fear. 

Surrender to DMT, let go, become.
