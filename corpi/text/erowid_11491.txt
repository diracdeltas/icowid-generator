For many people coming down off of ecstasy is a bitch. I have experienced many different types of crashes. They are most commonly a long term upset feeling, like I am on the brink of tears for like 30-60 mins. Or a few minutes of feeling really bad, like everything that I love has been killed. These are just a few things that I think help:

1. <!-- If you are listening to any sort of 'techno' music, turn it off. -->Putting on something that is a little less hyper than any sort of 'techno' music or or just leaving music off. 
2. <!-- Some people get really nervous or anxious when coming down. -->It helps to try to lay or sit down and concentrate on breathing steadily. 
3.Trying not to think about everything that is wrong with my life, any painful memories, or of the possible negative side effects of rolling. 
4. Taking a shower. Sometimes drugs like MDMA and even LSD I have found makes my skin feel dirty. And sometimes it makes me feel alot better to be clean. 
5. Sleeping for like 2 to 4 hours can be helpful for the day after. 
6. <!-- Many people take multivitamins for a few days after drugs use. I am not sure if this helps or not, but a lot of people I know say that it makes them feel better.
7. This is sort of dumb, but the kids who use pacifiers know what I mean! -->Putting on chapstick if I have been using a pacifier and my lips are really chapped. 

This is just what I have gained from my experiences and I hope that it might be able to help anyone soften the coming down.
