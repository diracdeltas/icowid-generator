Well I took the pill round 8:00.

T-8:30 I statr feeling a little wired nothing to crazy. I knew that I was in for it thought I could feel it coming.

T-9:00 I beagn to see many tracers. There were alot of differen color changes and then stuff started to move around. 

T-9:30 I began to get bored sitting at my girls house so we went for a walk. We walked up to the store and it was then that I could tell the chemical kicked in. My eyesight went blurry and i8 was seeing all sorts of different stuff. 

T-10:00 I got back to the house and everything was wiered out. It felt like I had just taken LSD for the first time.

T-10:30 I decided to sit down and watch Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I saw all sorts of stuff popping out of the tv. I watched a poster that was on my wall Melt infront of me. Then I saw my girlfriends face started to grow.

T-11:00 I looked over at my friend and I saw his head grow and shrink then grow again. That wiered me out so I quit looking at him.

T-12:00- I could start to feel that I was coming down but I was still tripping out. There were also 5 other people with me on the same drug. 

T-1:00 I thought I was coming down but the trip just got more intense with alot more tracers and colors.

Conclusion: Well the trip was great I loved it. It reminded me of a cheaper form of acid. It was also very wierd though. The one negitive thing is that for a few days after I took it I felt really stupid. Like 2-CE made me feel dumb for a couple of days later. I was slower with everything that I did. All in All it was one hell of a trip
