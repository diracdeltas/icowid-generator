Klonopin is one of the best anti-anxiety drugs out there, probably right behind Xanax and Valium. 2mg makes me feel like I've had a few pints of ale. I am a former alcoholic, so even though I don't drink I am always on the lookout for heady downers. I first started taking Klonopin when a friend gave me a few. I had been robbed and was freaking out and wouldn't calm down so he gave me little green pills and said take two at a time. They turned out to be 1mg generic clonazepam and put me in a great, loose, happy mood. They are a long acting benzodiazipine drug so I don't feel all depressed the next day like with xanax (alprazolam). I just feel good and relaxed, they are the perfect happy pill.

The only time I ever blacked out in my whole life was from taking lots of klonopin and then taking xanax. Just be careful mixing this with other drugs, anti-anxiety or otherwise.
