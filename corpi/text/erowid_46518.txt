Of all the myriad psychedelic experiences I have had throughout my life, I have never remembered anything so vividly as my unique trip on Datura. In retrospect, it was quite horrifying.

After mincing the petals of three Datura flowers, boiling them, and mixing the resulting liquid with ice cubes, sugar, and kool-aid, a female friend [referred to here as Lauren] and I each drank half a cup of this mixture. We sat on a couch, watching a movie. A short time later, perhaps half an hour, I began experiencing shortness of breath. My heart was beating rapidly, and my thought processes had become muddled. I decided that removing my shirt and belt would help me to breathe. At this point, I walked outside and began gasping for air. Lauren walked out at some point, and I went inside with her, after the feelings of suffocation had passed. 

We sat together on her bed. I was feeling reprehensive about the experience thus far, but I sat patiently, doing my best to stay calm and have a conversation. Every so often I'd hallucinate that I had a lit cigarette in my hand, and attempt to take a drag off it, only to realize that it wasn't lit. At this point, I began to sink further and further in to delirium. My memory of the next few hours is very hazy, and I can't be sure if any of it actually happened. When I had come back to my sense, I was in the backyard. By this time, I was quite far gone, and I began having hallucinations of people I knew. I remember quite clearly one instance where I saw a good friend of mine, Chad. We began having a dialogue. I asked him what he was doing there, and he informed me that he had taken datura too. 

When I asked him why I was in the backyard and what I should do, he stopped moving. I did a double take, and he had turned into a tree. As I gazed at it, I saw a pattern in the leaves that vaguely resembled his face. I remember thinking that mistaking this pattern for a person's face seemed like a perfectly rational mistake to make, although whenever I went back to the tree, I wasn't able to discern that pattern again. I walked to the front of the house at one point. The car was gone, and I didn't know what to make of it. The house was completely locked, so, unclear as to what I should do, I decided to wait for Lauren to return. As I sat on the lawn furniture in the backyard puffing on cigarettes, I saw a starfish laying on the chair next to me. I stared at it, perplexed, for a good while. After going to check and see if Lauren had returned to her room yet, I noticed the chair again and realized that the starfish was actually a rip in the upholstery. 

At this point, I realized something was very wrong with me, and that I needed to get back home. I wandered through the neighborhood. A bit into my trek, I experienced amnesia, and I suddenly began looking for my house, which was a several miles away. I didn't realize this, however, and began searching for landmarks from my neighborhood that I would recognize. At some point, my train of thought changed once again. I made my way out of the neighborhood, onto a sidewalk. I began walking. I would hear a cellphone ring periodically, and I'd pull it out of my pocket as if to answer it. I brought it up to my ear, and at that point I would realize that there was no cellphone in my hand, and that I didn't have one on me at all. I eventually made my way over to a well lit plaza, and found a payphone. I waited behind a man who was using it for what seemed like fifteen minutes, although I eventually realized there hadn't been anybody there to begin with. Feeling distraught, I called a family member, who eventually picked me up. Although I'm told I was brought to a hospital where I had my stomach pumped, I have no recollection of this at all, short of waking up in my bed the next morning with a throbbing headache.

In summation, I can only say that although this drug produced powerful hallucinations, I was far too delirious to enjoy the experience. This was easily the worst drug-related experience I have ever had, and most certainly the single worst experience of that year of my life. I had eaten LSD, mescaline, and psychedelic mushrooms previous to this, and I was completely unprepared for the intensity of this substance.
