I've smoked the resin extract of Wild Dagga that I got from an online supply and I must report that it is quite a pleasant smoke. I didn't expect the high to be like cannabis so I wasn't disappointed by its effects. After smoking the resin, I find myself getting lost in thought, like with cannabis, but I'm not feeling any kind of sedation or heavy-headedness. The feeling from wild dagga is more sensual and I'm finding that music takes on a different quality - it's like I can better understand the communication or the language of music. I'm feeling euphoric but the energy of the euphoria isn't hyped-up - it's got a smooth rev to it. I also smoked some cannabis after the wild dagga to see how the two herbs might work in combination. I would say, without a doubt, that the wild dagga potentates the cannabis. I smoked some older weed that was pretty mild but its effects were definitely increased by the effects of the dagga resin. This is very tasty stuff indeed!
