well, i first dropped X during April of 1999. 

I can honestly say that X was magical to me in those beginning times. i felt like i loved everyone, and that everyone loved me back. many people continue dropping (like i did) with the expectation that their next hit will be the same... i got bad news for u my friend, for many people it just goes downhill from there. i know i can't even be considered anything close to ecstacy veteran... but i already have lost that sense of happiness while rolling... i've been sober for 5 months now... but i still miss X very much. although its not physically addicting, its hella mentally addicting... i can't stop thinking about it. also, i've noticed my ability to recall past experiences is shot to hell. even my own childhood memories have been reduced to simple, blurry images. i have trouble remembering what i did 4 days ago, and i have a small case of attention deficit disorder... i can't pay attention to a person for more than a minute. realizing what X has really done to me, however, doesn't change the fact that i still crave it.

i HAVE learned to use the pill much more responsibly... b4 i used to drop 2-4 pills a night at about 1-2 times a week... bad call, that doesnt give ur brain sufficient time to repair itself, now i have drastically reduced my intake to 2-3 pills a YEAR... maybe that will lessen the effects... but who really knows right? 

peace out and be careful... X is too good to be true sometimes... specially in the long run
