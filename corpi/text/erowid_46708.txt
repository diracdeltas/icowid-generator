I only smoked the liquid pcp (on parsley) once when a coworker asked me to try it. having smoked powder before I kind of knew what to expect. I smoked it outside the factory on the afternoon shift and came back in and talked with the same coworker, or really tried to make sense after it hit me. I felt like sitting by the nearest lil platform under a rattling heat duct that was vibrating through me not unlike electricity, distractingly.  I then stood up and tried walking, but it was more like gliding. 

Don't remember revelations like on mescaline, just the detached, dissociative feelings. It can be unsettling especially if I had done too much, and the hum in my head made me glad I didn't. It took about an hour to start comin' down, gladly. I prefer the powder, since I can test a small amount easier. The funniest thing I remember is I surely wasn't bored since the simplest things seem to hold my attention for who knows how long. I could be transfixed for what seems like hours. <!--Wouldn't recommend an Indy 500 car race front row or anything like that.-->
