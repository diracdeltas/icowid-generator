E not so fun with Effexor

I found out the hard way that MDMA doesn't do much when I'm also taking Effexor, an antidepressant.  I'm not sure of exactly why this is, though I can probably guess.  I took two capsules over the span of a few hours and felt nothing but a slight buzz.  The first one I snorted and the second I ate.  My friend took the first pill with me, and right away he felt it come on strong, and I felt nothing.

This is only the second time I've taken MDMA, and it was the same amount that I took the first time, but there was a very pronounced difference between the two experiences.  While the first time I had a wonderful time and was extremely happy and energetic, this time I was mildly anxious the entire time.

I've read one other experience similar to mine, so I think it might be a common thing.
