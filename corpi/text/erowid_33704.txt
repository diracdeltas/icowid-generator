After already ingesting about 5 or 6 caps and some stems my friends and I began to contemplate whether or not we should try to smoke the magical mushrooms. We had never really heard of anyone trying it and weren't sure if it was a waste, or a dumb idea altogether. Since it was just a few close pals we decided to give it a go.

The setting was a few friends in a safe environment, my friends house, with light music and some bud light. The effects of the first shrooms began to come apparent as we became euphoric and wittnessed brightening of colors and things of that nature. 

When we smoked the mushrooms we packed a bowl full of cut up shrooms mixed with some low grade commercial marijuana. In my personal opinion the effects seemed to become stronger and more apparent. However, having already  eaten some of the mushrooms before smoking them makes it hard to come to a positive conclusion as to whether or not smoking the shrooms had any effect. So my report seems to go along with your research, I just don't know! Maybe next time I'll try just smoking some and let you know how it goes!
