Craziness for a Candyflip

I took the LSD (marvin hits because of the Mrvin the Martian logo on the blotter paper) and immediately followed this with a full beer and with the beer, I swallowed the MDMA pill, an ecstacy hit called a Green Apple, which suggests that it was cut with light mescaline. The following three hours were filled with a great feeling of understanding regarding how substance and science reflect to create the illusion on of life, and as I played a few hours of Final Fantasy video games whilst listening to Led Zepeelin and the occasional masturbatory release, I felt the world was my own, a place in which I was allowed to frolick and play in a mystical garden of narcotics and splendor.

The follwing three hours were a bit shaky, and had I not had a pack of clove cigarettes, a shesha hookah and five  more beers to calm me down, I'm certain I would have been in for a bad night.<!--As a heavy user with extreme tolerance, I recommend that anyone going in for a candyflib wiht legitimate drugs that can warp everything you know about reality, make certain you have an equalizer on hand, or you will regret having ever imbibed such substance.-->
