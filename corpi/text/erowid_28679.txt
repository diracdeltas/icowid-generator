Alright so one day I decided to try mushrooms, wanting to trip. I wasn't expecting the trip to be anything like it was. I ate my shrooms around 9 am and I started to feel the minor effects at around 9:30. But at around 10 am it hit me...I was tripping hard. While I was in my room I saw faces and weird designs and I thought my rug lifted up off the ground. Everything is like a dream and I had no sense of anything...its like one happy cartoon. I had thoughts in my mind and I was thinking of the most bizarre things ever, but they were positive.

Afterwards I went for a bike ride and I saw the leaves as faces smiling and I couldn't to this very day describe how happy I was when I was on the shrooms. Everything is like a dream and everything is so happy and its just amazing... I don't take anything for granted, I looked up at the sky and it was so pretty I could sit there for years. I also remember crying to the music I was listening to, it was so beautiful. Basically shrooms is a positive experience and it is hard to have a bad trip. The only problem about them is I had a stomach ache but it was well worth it. I also remember laughing my head off when my friend came over and hearing the song breathe in my head by pink floyd... It was the most amazing day of my life
