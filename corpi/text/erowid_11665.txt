You will probably notice my weight and say that there is no way I can pop this many pills! Well I am living proof that a person my size can take just as much as anyone else can, and become addicted. I know that a lot of people hate reading novels, so I will put my experiences in point form, and sum it up when I am done.

- Have had previous experiences with other drugs such as: Alcohol, Pot, Cocaine(3 years addicted 4 years clean), Cough Syrup, and I am currently dependant on Zopiclone(sleeping pill). So I have had a lot of experiences with different drugs in my 24yrs of life.

- Took Gravol(dimenhydrinate) to help myself get off of Zopiclone.

                  MY EXPERIENCE IN THE LAST 8 MONTHS

- Took 5 pills 50mg - I passed out

- Took 10 next night, within 7 hour period

- My symptoms were: light headed, drooling, could not speek, talked to myself a lot, saw different things moving, felt like there were bugs all over me, twitching, chest pains, racing heart forgot what I was thinking most of the time, staggering like a drunk, hard time urinating, eyes are very sensitive to light, paranoid, heard voices. Sometimes horny, but can't 'get off'.

- After this experience, I would use every other night.

- Became bored and started using every night. 10-15 pills - 50mg
  NOT BEING JUDGEMENTAL but if a person feels that he/she needs to
  get high because of boredom, that they need help. I know I did!

- Last few weeks I have been taking

- When I was to high I would pop my sleeping pills to bring me down.

- I loved the two drugs together 

- 8 months later I am hooked on another drug besides Zopiclone

- So much worse (withdrawal) than Zopiclone

- I get headaches, I twitch, sometimes I puke, eye strain, shakes, hot/cold, itchy, can't sleep/to much sleep, crave more pills even when extremely high hard time speaking, muscles hurt, miserable, racing heart, and depression.

I am currently taking about 260 pills a month. I take about 60-80 Zopiclone 7.5mg, and around 200-210 Dimenhydrinate tablets 50mg.

I have not seen my doctor yet because I am to ashamed to tell him.
Now I take these pills just to survive. When I don't I feel like I 
am going to die. All of this because I was 'bored' and I wanted to feel euphoria(high)!
