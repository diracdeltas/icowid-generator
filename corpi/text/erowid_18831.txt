The Wormwood extract's listed strength was 3ml=1g dried foliage. Unfortunately, the yohimbe extract did not list its concentration, medicinal use was suggested at 30-40 drops 3 to 4 times daily. We tried mixing B&B (brandy/benedictine), and several other things individually to cover the bitterness of the Wormwood extract. We had no luck. Our eventual solution was to just shoot the small amount of mixture from a shot glass. In each shot, we put 60 drops of yohimbe ext, then 3.75 ml of Wormwood ext in the first round and 2.5ml in the second. The shots were seperated by about 90 minutes.

As I'm sure you can guess, the taking of the second shot was provoked by the very mild effects of the first. Approximately 60 minutes after taking the first, all of us got silly. Giddy even. A good time was being had by all. But no hallucinations or psychedalia.

We all decided we were hungry at the same time. We took the second shot after eating Macaroni and cheese, which was most entertaining to make...a definite group effort. This may have contributed to day after bodyload. Some of us experienced some dizziness, and all of us were randomly feeling too hot or cold. 

Upon going to bed around 5 hours after the initial dose, sex was nice. Some tactile enhancement and prolongment were evident, but not overly intense. 

The day after, some of us were feeling some serious body load. That passed by early afternoon. Overall, I wouldn't do it again with extracts due to the extreme bitterness and relatively mild effects. But it was a pleasant experience overall.
