My experience with Tramadol is that it is best experienced at low doses. I have been very successful with 3.5 50mg pills/day. (9am, noon, 3pm, .5 at 5pm) Tramadol stays in my system for hours, and I can prolong its peak by gradually incrementing the dosage. This creates a snowball effect which lasts until 11 or 12pm, just in time for a great nights sleep.

Yes, I believe I have discovered the eternal buzz. It is a very subtle feeling which could be compared to background music. It is easy to concentrate and focus on other activities, however during quiet (or otherwise boring moments) I get a feeling of well-being instead of boredom or anxiety. 

I have been extremely productive and feel no real side effects. This is not a party drug. In fact you will get an increasingly negative effect if I exceed my personal limit.
