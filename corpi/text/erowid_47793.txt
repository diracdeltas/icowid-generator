Well, not just 10 minutes ago was my first experience with Oxy. The pills I have read Endo 620 (which is 5mg of Oxycodone and 325 mg Acetaminophen per pill). Unsure of what to expect, I did some research and decided to give it a try. I crushed and snorted 2 1/2 pills. 

For the first 15 minutes or so was a slight buzz, and noticed to be in a little better mood. then not too long after that is when it kicked in. I got the slight itchy feeling for about 5 minutes. the high is a little weird, comparable to being drunk only in more control. and now i feel like I gotta chill and relax, so goodnight!
