I just thought I'd add my observations about eating extract strength sauce. The hottest sauce I have at the moment is [deleted] but I am looking to get a hotter one at some point. Chili allegedly releases endorphins and I'm inclined to agree.

So, here's an example of the pleasant effects of chili sauce:
I'd been having a pretty poor day having left part of an assignment in my flat, it had to be handed in that day so I had to walk there and back to collect the missing sheet and hand it in. Major effort.

I decided to go to the gym on the way back though (also a good natural endorphin high) and afterwards was pretty damn hungry. When I got back to my flat I cooked up some pasta with bolognaise sauce and added in about 4 drops of my hottest chili sauce (which is quite a lot really). It was very tasty and had a very pleasant burn to it which didn't mask the nice garlic and tomato flavour of the sauce. My mouth felt nice and tingly for a while after I'd finished.

So after that all I did was sit and check my email etc. Nothing special. When my flatmate came in and asked how my day had been I told him in all honesty that it had been really good, however when I thought about it I realized it had been mediocre at best. Strange I thought as I was feeling incredibly happy. I'd describe the feeling as a much cleaner and less intense feeling than the crazy happiness of MDMA. I finished my day by having a nice beer and reading a book in bed which was very enjoyable.

So there you have it. Chili as a healthy, natural and legal high, not to mention a damn tasty ingredient.
