I took this lunesta at least a half hour ago, probably closer to an hour ago but I cant remember what time I took it. Physically disoriented like tipsy. If I lie down and watch my lava lamp or have  the lava lamp in my peripheral then things I can see start moving and then I can look at those things and watch them move. Good stuff.
