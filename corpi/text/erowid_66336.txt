This is the closest I have ever seen prescription drugs compare to heroin. I took the 25mg of Librium and 8mg of the Dilaudid orally (on an empty stomach) a little over an hour ago and just took an 8mg intramuscular injection of Dilaudid about 10 minutes ago. I haven't felt this good in years. A+++ in my book. I can see why this stuff is so hard to get a doctor to prescribe it. It works very well.
