just went out to a gay club in the district and as it was my first time ever experimenting with MDA (to my knowledge I've never taken it before) I was a bit apprehensive....I've used MDMA plenty of times before and my last time was around 6 months ago or so and never had any complications...I didn't this time either...just a sense of well I should be a bit more careful since I haven't done it in a while and I'm never 100% on what I'm taking...did a bit of research and found the same name/same (Chanel) looking pill on dancesafe...I recommend all try that first or ask anonymously on msgboards in your local area if anyone's taken a particular pill just to make doubly sure...

anyway I took it and despite my slight nervousness of going out to a gay club for the first time I had an excellent time...one of my all-time best times ever in fact...it wasn't too speedy or too e-crush for me...it was just right...it really put me at ease and it was great dancing with my girlfriend and being allowed into the bathroom with her ;) I know a lot of people that get scared when taking pills but these were good and as far as I know pure MDA...I'd definitely do it again...
