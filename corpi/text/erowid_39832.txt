[Erowid Note: 
Most Coricidin contains CPM (Chlorpheniramine Maleate) which can be dangerous in high doses. See <a href='/chemicals/dxm/dxm_info2.shtml'>DXM Brand Warnings for more info.]

I started using DXM when I was 14.  At that time, I weighed about 120lbs.  I used DXM in the form of Coricidin Cough and Cold.  I know now that this is one of the worst sources of DXM because of side-effects from other active ingredients.  However, at the time, I didn't know I was using DXM.  I just knew that Coricidin gave me effects that I really liked and I could always get it.

I used on a regular basis for over two years.  For some periods of time I would use almost every day.  Other times it was on an occasional basis.  I used anywhere from 300-960mg.  However, on most occasions I would take 480mg.  When I was fifteen, I had a hospital visit, which was the result of a 960mg dose and my stupidity.  The doctor told me that I would be fine.  Other than vomiting blackouts, this was the only experience of its kind.

I quit using all drugs right before I turned sixteen, and remained clean for 2 1/2 years.  I have since began using in moderate amounts.  

The reason I'm writing this, is memory loss I have experienced, which I believe to be the result of DXM.  I now have a very hard time retaining any type of information.  I am very forgetful even about things that I really try to remember.  My attention span for reading has decreased greatly.  I don't know for a fact that DXM is the cause of my brain damage (might as well call it what it is).  I also used inhalants heavily for a period of time.  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.  I wish I had read about the risks involved with dissociatives before using them.  I may have acted differently if I had.
