I am experienced with psychoactives of all kinds, 19 years of age, and also very researched concerning the subject.  I have received satisfying effects from most substances and believe myself to have a relativley average response to both 'surface' drugs (pharmaceuticals, alcohol, caffeine) and psychedelics.

In several experiments attempting to find out the psychoactive value of morning glories, I came to a dissapointing conclusion.  I tried the MG's (heavenly blue, no poisoning present) at doses of 1.5, 4, 5.4, & 6.5 grams.  All of these experiments seemed to fail as I never recieved pronounced effects.  In fact, I never even recall being off baseline!  Anyway, I did the research, got the right seeds, and consumed them in the correct manor.  So why didn't my trials work???

I guess I'll never know because I'll just stick to good ol' LSD from now on.  

Everyone reacts differently to drugs and I don't want this failure to discourage anyone else from trying Morning Glrories.  I just want to put it out there that you can supposedly do it right and still not receive many effects.
