I recently purchased about an ounce of dried mugwort from an herb shop. I had read about mugwort's potential as a dream potentiating herb, and it appealed to me more than calea zacatechichi (due to calea's side effects such as auditory and visionary hallucinations which, for probably a majority of those who are reading this would find that favorable, is not something I was looking for)

Anyway, I filled two capsules full of mugwort, and took each of the capsules within fifteen minutes.  mugwort can supposedly produce a 'marijuana like high' but I did not experience this whatsoever, because 1)I have never tried marijuana and 2)I went to sleep shortly after I took the mugwort.  I found a bit of difficulty in falling asleep, but I eventually did (perhaps the plant has some stimulant properties).  In my sleep, I had many long and, for lack of a better way to describe them, epic dreams.

I managed to remember most of them, too.  in the morning, as with most herbs, I did not feel any different at all, and I felt refreshed in a sense.  mugwort is on some 'legal high' websites, but I personally would not recommend it for that.  it can be smoked, but it is supposed to have a large tar level.
