As I am writing this I am accidentally mispelling things, and I have to correct myself.  Im sorry that I already started writing when experiencing the effects.  It went like this.

I took 1 ambien 10mg, then half of another.  In 20 minutes I started to notice a nice calm feeling in the atmosphere, nothing in myself yet.  Wow, so it does not come up as fast as they say.

I looked the mirror and noticed something pretty strange.  If I stared for a while my face would morph into things that resembled a mushroom experience.  Not as strong, but still quite alien.

From here I am noticing that I cant think of what to say (haha i know).  This confuses me because I can't think of anything to say and yet I just said it.  I am getting distracted by the various written things telling me to write this stuff.

When I close my eyes it feels like I drift away, and there is a buzz going through my hands.  This is really cool, I looked in to the mirror again and saw my head shrink and grow.  Everything is going fine.

I'm sorry If I sound like an infant but I feel positively FLOATY!  I could have fun just staring at random things and it is hard to type. 

Conclusion:  Im going to leave this report, but ide say that ambien does indeed have some recreational power, and it brings me back to my infant days.<!--Careful, its still a drug.-->
