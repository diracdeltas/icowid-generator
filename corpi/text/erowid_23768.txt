Keep in mind I didn't plan any of this as I would've slept more to prepare myself...

Friday - woke around 1PM, went to work (food service) at 4PM-1AM

Saturday - about 2AM went to a bar with some friends for a few drinks (beer & tequila)
7AM went to friends house listened to music & did some speedballing (coke & crystal mixture), went to work 10AM-4PM speeding like crazy slightly drunk? Unable to focus or stand still - constant motion
5PM-9PM home and forced self to sleep for 2 1/2 hours
10PM back to friends house to hang out - more speedballing ensued...

Sunday - near 12AM driving by self for over an hour to attend a small electronic event
1:37AM arrive at club meet with friends dancing
3AM introduce acid takes around an hour to take effect
4AM mild perceptional distortions speeding like mad still
5:20AM leaving club to go to friends house convince someone else to drive just in case
5:45AM arrive to complete chaos at friends house more people here running amuck than at the club

6AM trip starts to take off and I am very confused, *time distorted near this point* uncomfortable situational setting, strange thoughts enter my head. At one point I am convinced that I am god, rapid mood swings, confusion, in peak of trip begin crashing off of speed!!! Thoughts of outer-lying consciousness of the world, loss of self, disturbing depressing thoughts, immense exhaustion, lack of sleep induced dementia, attempting to force myself to sleep, visuals more vivid when eyes closed but more comforting. 

No one would talk to me so I could calm down - they were all too involved with their own (mostly MDMA induced) experiences. Finally started calming down when an old (and empathetic) friend arrived to soothe the situation he found me in, I was crying and very frightened.

Lack of sleep induced dementia + crashing off of cocaine and crystal meth + lsd = psychotic break (IMO)
