<!--not good enough to post but reports on recreational use of epinephrine-->

I chose to submit this report because of some interesting things that have transpired from a drug that I once thought as recreational.  For some time, I had been using Primatine mist inhaler to cop a buzz.  The inhaler containes some sort of inert alcohol, and epinephrin, a man-made form of adrenalin.

Abusing this inhaler is easy, one simply buys the device, usually about $15, and then takes two to five hits off of it.  This produces a nice rush of adrenalin which is similar to a speed buzz, and lasts about 15 minutes.  It's nothing heavy, just a quick little pick-me-up to put an edge on you.  One inhaler will last a very long time, and refills are cheap.

I remember reading that ergotamine is used to about migraine headaches due to it's vascular constriction properties.  I happen to suffer from migraines.  Being unable to see a doctor and get any ergotamine or other magraine medication, I simply grit my teeth and bear it.  Today, however, I decided that epinephrin might help when I found myself coming down with a migraine.  I took 5 shots off of the inhaler at the first sign of a migraine (for me it's blind spots in my vision), an lo and behold, my headache was very mild, compared to the usual 5-9 hour monster that I get.  I can attribute this due to the vascular constriction properties of adrenalin.  I plan to repeat the experience next time I get a migraine.
