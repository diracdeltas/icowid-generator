My buddy and I were bored one night (a common occurance) and we had some White Superman Ecstasy hangin' around.  We were in a slight disagreement about if it was possible to smoke E as a freebase, rather than the standard pinch-on-a-bud.  so,at 12 AM we proceeded to cut our pills into thirds, and took a 1/3 of our pills each to the pipe.  We each drew in rather large hits, which when we exhaled were extremely thick in the air.  This 'freebase' stuff seemed to have quite a life to it, as we both got about 8 or 10 hits off our bricks before they were pooched.  By the time we were done smoking, we both agreed that there was a definite buzz to be felt.

After we sat around for a few minutes (say, 15) we decided it was time to sniff up the rest, just for the hell of it.  We each got 6 lines out of our remainder, which we took 3 & 3 per side.  Only bad part about this is the nasal drainage $hit, but hey, nothing's perfect.  Effects were felt almost immediately, and again we agreed that this was a pretty good night for us.

Although smoking the E did prove successful, it didn't actually seem to add to the effects.  If anything, it may have taken slightly from the overall.  We were finished rolling completely within 2.5-3 hours, and personally I felt nearly back to baseline.  This was slightly dissapointing, but it's not something another E won't fix.  Overall, I think that even though you can smoke the pill itself, it's probably best to just stick to mixing it with mj.  The combination of the two compound each other really well.
