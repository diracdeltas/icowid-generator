In a reasonably comfortable setting, I weighed out approxamately 7mg, which was one fairly long crystal.  I placed it in a Glass Ball Pipe  (Oil Pipe, Crack Pipe) and applied a flame to the bottom of the pipe until smoke rose up.  I inhaled strongly, and didn't experience the 'awful taste' that I've heard described, but did almost immediately feel a 'vibration' through my entire body, an apparent energy flow.  I quickly put the pipe down and turned off my light.  I lay back in bed and felt the experience rise to a +2.5 within less than a minute.  Then things started to get bad.

I made the mistake (?) of attempting to check my pulse, as one of my common, somewhat-reasonably-based concerns is that of a rapid heart rate during psychedelic experiences (I have a mild heart arrhythmia problem that often manifests itself as a higher-than-most-people-get heart rate during psychedelic experiences).  I clocked my heart at something like 200 beats per minute.  Or at least I thought I did, as I was barely capable of cohesive thought.  I fumbled for my cell phone which I had placed out of reach and had turned off, and tried to call my girlfriend to have her come over and make sure I didn't die.  The fear grew into something nearly intolerable until I reminded myself that my body would metabolize this chemical very quickly and the experience would soon be over.  

I buried the fear as best I could, and let the waves of strange sensations pass over me.  Within ten or fifteen minutes I had returned to a level where I could *actually* check my heart rate, and think more clearly, but I wasn't at baseline.  Since I felt more or less fine, I stopped worrying about my health.  I was at baseline within an hour, and felt perfectly fine, even refreshed.

Moral?  Be in good health before you take psychedelics, and don't let your fears overtake you.
