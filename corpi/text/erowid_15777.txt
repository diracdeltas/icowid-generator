I turned 18 saturday so I went to buy everything I couldn't buy before - I bought some porn, a big can of tobacco, and a grabbed a packet of those energy pills they put up front at the gas stations.

Over the course of the rest of the night I consumed all three tablets. All I have to say is yeah I was on a speed rush and very hyper a lil jittery - it was ok and all but I'm rarely ever depressed over anything and on this occasion after I came down I was a pitiful sad sad sad selfloathing pile of shit, it was pathetic and depressing. I hated my life. I was a tad drunk and quite high too, neither of those ever had that effect on me though.

Then I thought it may have been watching FROM HELL that pushed me in that direction. The next day I took two tablets, I noticed a slight up but the down afterward was again very sad and depressing. All I have to say is that if you take any of these diet pills or energy pills be prepared for some unfocused pointless mood swing of depression, it sucks.
