I have taken LSD-25 on many occasions throughout the years and it was only recently that Hawaiian Woodrose seeds came to my attention. It was a happy discovery. I read various ideas on how to ingest these: such as the water extraction methods etc... and after experimenting, I definately know the best way so I thought I'd share it.

1) remove the husks (as usual)

2) grind and crush seed using a pestle and mortar : 

There are many kinds of pestle and mortars on the market. I tried a few. Most are useless since they grind to coarsely or not at all, probably good for kitchen spices but no good for this process. The best brand by far is the Mason and Cash variety. These are semi professional pestle and mortars. They can be quite expensive, but great it if you can find a cheap one on ebay or somewhere. None of the other brands seem to do the trick properly. The Mason Cash brand has a final grinding refinement that makes the next step work very well indeed.

3)grind seed into the finest powder possible: it may take 5 -10 minutes or continuous grinding to get the powder very very fine.

4) place a small amount of powder in mouth and repeat as necessary

5) if the powder is very very fine then it will dissolve into your mouth and tongue immediately, and give no nausea! Hooray !

This sounds simple but I tired the other more complicated methods and this is by far the best way.
