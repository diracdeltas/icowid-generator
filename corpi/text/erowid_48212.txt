Recreational value: moderate. I rate it higher than codeine and opium but certainly lower than hydrocodone, oxycodone, heroin, or morphine. Note that I am a fan of the opiates and that I have never experienced the negative side effects of them that others complain about, such as nausea, dizziness, or mental unclarity. 

Effects: apathy, marked sedation, slight body high, floating feeling, slight feeling of warmth, lack of physical coordination, heavy limbs, extreme pupil constriction, lack of hunger, exophoria, strong anxiolytic properties, slight euphoria, none of the sociability I invariably feel with the other opiates, lack of physical pain (obviously), opiate-typical nightmares, opiate-typical difficulty in having orgasm (can be a big benefit for sex, actually, along with the lack of pain), distance from everyday problems, skewed passage of time (it doesn't pass fast the way it would with speed or meth, but I can space out for long periods of time or be apathetic to time and find myself doing the same thing for hours on end without feeling either bored or particularly interested by it).

Doses: (on various days) 50mg ingested, 3.5 mg inssuflated, 7mg inssuflated, 13mg inssuflated, 7 mg ingested, 13mg ingested, 20mg ingested (three times), 35mg ingested.

Preferred dosage: 7-13mg ingested, 3.5-6mg insufflated. This opiate is much stronger than it appears! Taking more does not lead to more recreational results!! I will at best fall asleep, or at worst (such as with 13mg or more insufflated) almost suffer overdose, as indicated by blue appendages, almost complete cessation of breathing, very low heart rate, falling alseep/passing out even while moving around, stumbling and extreme lack of coordination, complete mental confusion and inability to follow through a thought, inability to focus eyes, and relative mental calmness about the certainty of impending opiate overdose.
