[Erowid Note: 
Most Coricidin contains CPM (Chlorpheniramine Maleate) which can be dangerous in high doses. See <a href='/chemicals/dxm/dxm_info2.shtml'>DXM Brand Warnings for more info.]  

I have been having long term effects from DXM. It was my first drug and quickly became my drug of choice. I started by using coricedin cough and cold, twelve tablets. Once I felt myself coming down just a little I would pop twelve more. This system didn't work for long because 3 months later I couldn't get anything out of them without taking twenty eight. I overdosed purposely twice. Long story short I ended up in a jail and a residential treatment center for a combining total of one year. While in there I began noticing that I would sometimes go on random 'trips' of DXM, not the good euphoric feeling, but the babbling, loss of words, and studdering.

My memory is terrible now. I cannot remember an hour ago. It has been almost six months since I relapsed on coricedin and I am still having the same problems. I also get random stomach pains. One lingering effect is the blotches of color I see on walls. If I look at a blank wall I will see blotches of usually green or black. I had my eyes tested and they check out fine. I mixed coricedin with LSD and THC for about 3 months at 3 to 4 times a week. I also often mixed it with alcohol, morphine, oxycontin, dramamine, valium, and shrooms. I expiramented with new drugs while on it also. I don't know if I am the only one who has had this problem.
