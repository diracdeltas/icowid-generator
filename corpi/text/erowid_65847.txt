For about a year now I've been experimenting heavily with mixing LSD and different types of meditation such as kundalini meditation and astral projection.

A friend got me a really good batch of liquid LSD and at around the same time I'd been using an audio entrainment called 'Meditation Mastery Activations' for Higher Self communication.

So of course I decided to mix the two.

I was staying in a friend's cabin in the Californian redwoods and she was away at the time - perfect.  The acid was really smooth, I was sitting out in the sun looking at the trees and could see them breathing.  The trunks were pulsating in and out.  I could also clearly see the trunks radiating a bright green aura.  

Clearly things were kicking in nicely so I put on my headphones and started the Higher Self meditation.

Seconds, minutes, hours later?  I don't know.  I behind closed eyes I could just see white light getting stronger and stronger.  I began to hear a beautiful hum and I started getting visions as if I was traveling at light speed.

All of a sudden I felt myself burst into some kind of dimension.  Where all this light was coming from.  I was floating, flowing, soaking in it.  I could see inside my body and I saw it being filled with these streams of light.  Things would slow, then speed up amazingly fast and I couldn't keep up, but at all times it was ecstatic.

I had the strongest feeling that I was floating inside my Higher Self somehow.  I just knew.  I didn't need anything here and I didn't want for anything.  I must have been here for a few hours, because when I came out the sun had changed a fair bit in the sky.

It's taken me a lot of time to process this experience and there is so much I just can't put into words.    

This was one of the most profound experiences that I've ever had.
