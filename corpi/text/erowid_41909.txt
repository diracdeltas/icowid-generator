First, some background.  I have experimented with about every drug out there save heroin, ketamine, ghb, and perhaps obscure research chemicals.  I hadn't tried  chewing betel, so I decided to give it a whirl.  I purchase dried betel slices, betel leaf, and lime paste at a favorite online superstore.  Then, I proceeded, on one drunken night, to chop the dried betel nut and put it in a betel leaf with some lime paste.  

Then I put the whole wrapped-up leaf in my mouth, gave it a chew or two, then put it between my gums like chewing tobacco.  The effects were not very strong or pronounced at all.  After ten or fifteen minutes of chewing the betel, I was still drunkenly tired.But wait, not only was I still tired, but the inside of my mouth burned like a motherf*cker.  The next day my gums hurt sooooo bad.  Two days later dead skin kept on coming off my gum, and I was still in moderate pain.  

Three days after the chewing I can tell that my mouth was injured, but it no longer hurts that bad.
