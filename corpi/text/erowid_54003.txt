You guys are #*#(*#*&# crazy !!!!  I lost my son to an accidental GHB overdose and you treat imbibing this substance as a joke - attempting to use medical terminology to make innocent/naive teens and young adults think that it is a wonderful experience.  For those family members, particularly parents, who have to watch their child lay in a coma in a hospital bed, or even pass on....I can only say shame on you for making light of the situation.  You reference the high cost of the hospitalization as it relates to your opinion of the insignificance of the overdose reactions.  Wake up and smell the coffee, you jack butts....there is NO safe drug !!!  I dare you to print this on your website.  

A grieving parent for a life taken too soon.
