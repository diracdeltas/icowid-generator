I had been tripping for some time, I fell in love with it. I felt as if I were in a fantasy land, and anything I dreamt of was possible. That night me and my best friend decided to trip and walk around the apartment complex. We both took two hits around 8:30. She weighs in at 105 pounds, me 125. Both of our experiences were totally different. Hers was good, mine a living hell.

We decided to smoke some weed, because it always enhanced our trip. After a couple of bowls of Hydro, I decided to get something to drink. As I got up, I saw everything distorted, words did not makes sense, and I lost myself in my brain and the drug completely. I called out to my friend, and said 'I'm  going to die'. She took me for a walk, and I saw colors and with every step I took, I sunk farther in the ground. I looked at my friend, and she had no body, just a huge face. A car was coming straight at me, and I just stared, she had to pull me out of the way.

She took me to her house, and tried to calm me down. As I sat on the carpeted floor, my bones were seeping through my skin, I felt knives stabbing at me, and felt the pain. I literally went crazy. The words didn't come out,the pictures i saw were flashes of the devil, angels, clouds, knives ... all I could think of. My body felt like jello, then rock hard. I eventually came off of it around 8:00a.m in the morning. Till this day, I have permanent trails, and lights seem like stars. In the pitch black, I still see colors, and when I think of an object, I can see it. It has been 3yrs since I tripped, and I feel the effects til this day.
