Drunk

There is a first time for everything.  I smoked three bowls and 10x salvia, equaling about half a gram.  I don't know if i did it wrong or if I need more because of body weight.  I used a water pipe and a butane torch to light it.  I held my breath for 20 to 30 seconds per hit as instructed by other online articles, but all I experienced was the sensation of being drunk.

Loose arms and legs, but nothing like seeing aliens or shit.  The effects didn't last long either.  I smoked about ten minutes ago and I feel like nothing now.  I am a bit disappointed do to all the hype surrounding salvia, but I will try it again in the future hopefully with better results.
