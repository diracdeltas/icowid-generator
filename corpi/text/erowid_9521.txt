I'm the type of person who prefers drugs (pot, PCP, LSD, MDMA...) to alcohol. But one night (out of boredom and lack of weed) , a few friends and acquaintances and myself decided to drink (again). But this time we got a lot more than just beer. We each (out of the 10 or us) had about 3-4 40's each and a bottle or two of rum and Vodka. 
We first started off sitting at a friend's house drinking the vodka and rum. Then we sat around thinking we weren't drunk enough. We then went for the 40's. This was a bad idea from the start.
We were 1/2 way done when we realized that we were drunk. We were falling over everything and could not get up. The girls were ditsy and the guys were horney (not a great combo). We started running in circles, which made it worse. We left and ran up to complete strangers and saluted Adolf Hitler (not the best thing to do I know).
Afterwards, girls were making out with anyone in the group who had anything left to drink. They were basically selling themselves out for a 'better' intoxication. They were degrading themselves and realized that in the end.
A little later, all the guys were trying to get the girls to sleep with them. No one wanted to though. But being intoxicated, many of them just passed out and were taken advantage of. That was the saddest day I've experienced so far. It's hard to see some of your friends corrupted and others being defiled. I regret it very much. 
If this story actually does get on the site and someone reads it, I hope they gain something from it. You should be VERY cautious when you drink (and if you do for that matter). It was a terrible experience which shattered friendships, ruined lives, and overall changed everyone for good. The only thing I hope is that it doesn't happen to anyone else out there. Be careful and be safe. Peace.
