I have been taking Xanax for 4 years. I tried to slowly wean myself off this and experienced the worst feelings ever. It made me black out, everything was distorted, cannot focus on anything, heart racing so bad it scares me out of your mind, feeling that I'm going to pass out that second. It even caused a seizure from not taking the pills for only a day and a half. I have been on other medications such as Paxil, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Lithium, Remeron and several others and had no side affects. When first put on the Xanax I was told it was not habit forming, now I am looking at drug rehab because it is life threatening for me to stop taking it. Please do more research before taking this drug. There are many other really bad experiences but I only named the major ones.     I never before was this bad untill I was put On XANAX please listen to my personal experience and consider first before you are in my shoes.
