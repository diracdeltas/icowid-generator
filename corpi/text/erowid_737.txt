Combining alcohol extractions of salvia (best possible if you grow, using both dried and fresh leaves), linden flower, passionflower, syrian rue, sassafras root bark and perhaps cannabis and papaver somniferum. Let dried salvia leaves soak it up & evaporate it naturally (no added heat). Random amounts--maybe 0.5 oz. salvia extraction source to a like quantity of dried material--can lead to a very strong, good-smelling mixture that can have fast & overwhelming effects, possibly increased by the added MAOI's. St. John's wort and gingko are good additives or stabilizers for the mind if things are too weird. Expect a heavily-fragrant, sticky dark end product somewhat similar is appearance to a tobacco pipe mixture. Be sure to strain/drain off solids before adding extract, and DO NOT EAT.
