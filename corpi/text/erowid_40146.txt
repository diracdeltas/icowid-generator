My friend Dave died two nights ago as a result of a 2ce overdose. My other friend who was with him (who was successfully resucsitated) said that they licked and dipped their fingers in it three times each (exact dose unknown). He has no recollection of when they passed out, only that they were both found the next day, one dead and the other near death. Apparently Dave got the stuff over the internet from China. Be careful...he always was.
