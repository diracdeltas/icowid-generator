In South Africa for my 20th birthday, some friends and I each ate a handful of datura seeds. We were really inebriated on beer. It took longer than expected to kick in, in fact we were wondering if we should do some more when it started. I felt like I had a brick in my stomach, desperately needed to pee but couldn't and lost control over my arms and legs for somewhere between five to seven days. The four of us sat in a room watching pictures move around the walls and spiders crawl on us. Later we were laughing about it in a pub and the guys at the table next to ours thought they should try it. The one landed up in a coma for about three weeks.

I was dyslexic for about 5 months afterwards and thirteen years later, I feel that I permanently lost about 40% of my inner strength and vitality, not to mention brain power. Leave datura alone.
