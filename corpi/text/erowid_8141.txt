I have had a lot of problems since my last E experience. I am a 20 yo male who has tried E 3 times over the course of the past year prior to the one I took 2 weeks ago. It was taken at a friends house, in a very relaxed environment. Since that E, I have experienced depression, lack of thought clarity, terrible sleeping problems, lack of appetite, lack of motivation and drive, lack of emotions, and a general feeling of unwellness. I was unable to work for a week and a half after the E due to loss of confidence and the other symptoms. 

I saw my doctor after 5 days of these symptoms, told him everything, and have been put on Lovan, an anti-depressant similar to prozac. I have been on that drug for over a week now, but am still suffering from the symptoms described above. Despite much searching of the internet, I have been unable to find a similar instance to what I have experienced. I will never go near the drug again, that is for sure.
