I was, and still am a good student. But for one semester in high school, I wound up with C's and D's in all of my classes because I just couldn't stay awake and attentive.  This was the semester I was put on Seroquel, an anti-psychotic med.

They put me on the stuff because I was bi-polar and mood stabilizers (Lithium, Depakote) didn't work for me.  

It's very simple to explain what Seroquel does.  It fills my  head with fog so I can't go crazy, let alone fully realize what's going on around me.

I don't remember much from that time in my life.  I slept about 16 hours, every night.  Friends who remember me from back then say I was a walking zombie and couldn't carry on a coherent conversation.

Eventually, I asked my doctor to take me off of it.
