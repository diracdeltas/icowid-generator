Surreal Savannah

As they say, "Now it's just a memory",
the rolling hills of the stretched out landscape.
What was my trip like? One word: ecstasy.
My inner thoughts and my mental shape
deteriorating to the fullest extent,
space and time well spent.

Rolling on electric bridges wailing
as my heart pounds with the audio input
driving through my brain like Nine Inch Nailing.
My mind is open and barriers shut.
My partner and I roll throughout the night
at each other's side, everything is right.

Traditional euphoria achieved with a pill
as my inside is buzzing, my outside sits still.
And although I don't long for the days of old
surreal Savannah still sparkles in my soul.
