My mom recently had surgery and got a vicodin prescription.  And she didn't like the idea that we enjoyed drugging her up, so she didn't really take them that often.  So I did ! :)

I was bored one day so I popped in a 7.5 mg of hydrocone (vicodin) :D

I waited like 10 minutes...nothing...
I sat down for a bit started gettting hot?!?!?! So I went in my living room and I was fine.
About 20 minutes later I was sick of waiting so I popped in another one.  About 20 minutes later I was on my computer and one of my hands was playing with my earing and I started to notice I was tiring me out! All I was doing was moving my index finger.  I got up and I felt really hot and very weak.  So now I'm writing in here and I just want to take a nap in a cold room.  Every time I stand up and walk around I feel nauseous.  And wen I sit back down I feel  dizzy for a moment.  So far its been lasting like 30 minutes ABOUT.  I'm not hungry any more I noticed. Not only that, I really don't feel like eating even something yummy.  Wen I sing really loud it gives me the feeling I get wen I stretch my arms in the morning. Weird.

Everything is slow and I'm tired.

That's all it did for me.  Nothing really good or bad happened.
