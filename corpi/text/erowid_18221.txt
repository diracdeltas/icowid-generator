In any case, I strongly believe smoking mushrooms does work. I have tried it several times. The first was a failed attempt because i had only two small (about an inch long, fully intact) mushrooms left over from a previous trip. I decided that wasn't enough, so the second time i smoked about a gram of mushrooms with a gram of marijauna. I found that the taste was improved and i got a great body high with some CEV's (closed eye visuals) lets just say i smoke alot of pot and i never, ever get that high. My most recent experiece with smoking mushrooms occured the night i grabbed a bag of mushrooms form a friend and ate most of it right away. I saved about a gram and combined it with a gram of some pot again and smoked right away. After the bowl was smoked i began to feel the body high and as i looked around the room i realized i was already tripping hard after only 5 minutes. Usually it takes a good 15 minutes for mushrooms to kick in at all for me. By the time the smoked mushrooms had worn off i was peaking off of the eaten ones.
And my approach is to smoke them with marijauna for taste and temperature concerns, and smoking them after eating some.
