I hadn't had much experiences with chemicals before this, apart from amphetamine and one crappy ecstasy pill, although I am quite experienced with natures psychedelics.

It was around 3pm when I bought one capsule of 5-MeO DiPT from a friend of mine with was supposed to contain 35mg of the thing.

After that I went to my friend to ingest it and just when I got to my friends apartment the other friend with I bought the capsule called me and told me to wait until he makes sure that he didn't accidentally sell me a  capsule with 45 mg.

Well, I waited about for one hour (it was around 5pm) and after that I couldn't wait no longer, so I decided to open the capsule and split the thing in 3 parts and take 2/3 myself and let my friend ingest 1/3.

I had heard that 5-MeO DiPT could be insufflated so I snorted the 2/3 of the capsule while my friend took his part orally.

That was a big mistake, the thing burned my nose like hell!

Well as I was sitting on the chair and suffering from the burn after 15 minutes I noticed that I was feeling pretty strange, the feeling could be compared to the first feeling I got from magic mushrooms, the 'what the fuck is happening? And, of course, feelings of heavy nausea.

The next thing I noticed was that the walls started to move in waves and some strange tribal patterns appeared on them.

As I was observing the hallucination, I suddenly noticed I was giggling hysterically.

My friend didn't feel much yet and he and his girlfriend started to tease my mind with all kinds of strange suggestions, and only thing I wanted to do was to listen the music ( if I remember right it was something from Hallucinogen) as it sounded greater than anything.

After awhile I noticed that I couldn't speak properly anymore, my voice started to lower it's tone as I spoke, this was extremely weird, but still extremely fun.

Suddenly I noticed that I was charged with this strange energy and started to move with the music and everything felt so alive and beautiful.

My friend had already started to feel effects and we started to examine the wallpapers together, this was too much for his sober girlfriend, who immediately left home.

I don't have clear memory of the time passing, but I think it was about 3 hours after ingesting the drug when I reached the peak, I felt energy, open-minded and extremely good, and after forming  the feeling into a proper sentence in my mind, I said to my friend: 'This is like having sex with your own mind.'

Well, we talked a lot with my friend and I wondered around the apartment, examining every corner of it as everything was feeling so interesting because of the hallucinations.

Around 8pm I started to come down, although I was still feeling mentally great, I had drained all the energy I had out of my body and stated to feel a bit tired. 

I stayed in my friends until 11:30pm and then left home. I was constantly thinking in my mind: 'That was GREAT.'

As I got home I ate some bread and went to bed, as I turned the lights off I noticed that the hallucinations were still there as I noticed some swirling images on my walls. It took around 1hour until I fell asleep.
