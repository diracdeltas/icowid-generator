Before my first experience with ecstasy I was a vetran in the use of alchool and marijuana. I had seen people on it's efects and talked to them and found it weird how most could act perfectly normal. My experience with MDMA lasted over 5 days. I was invited to a party on Sunday night I decided to go even though I had to go to school the next day. When I got to the party I met up with a good friend Chris he asked if I wanted any 'cookies'. I ask how much they cost. He said 10$ each I had 15$ and had planned to buy a gram and a half of weed but decided to go for the 'cookie' and save my 5$. I gave my ten bucks to Chris and he walked returning with a little pink pill. He said it was an afroman doublestacked. I swallowed it with a sip off Chris's beer. 

For at least 30 minutes I couldn't notice any type of effect. I asked Chris why nothing was happening he told me to hold on and wait a little longer. After about 40 minutes I had this strange sensation in my throat like the pill had opened in there. Then I began to feel the drug. For 15 minutes I got higher and higher until I reached a certain point then I remained there. The first thing I noticed was how good it felt to touch things. I was sitting on a couch next to this girl I had just met. I hadn't spoken to her until that point. Right about the time I noticed how nice it was to rub my legs together I began to talk to her. Her name was Michelle I remeber spending what seemed like hours in deep conversation with Michelle over which school in the area was the best. It had only been a 15 minute conversation.

I left to go find Chris and tell him how great of a buddy he was. I found Chris outside on the porch he asked me how I was feeling and I smiled and said great. I kept that smile on my face for the rest of the night, talking to everybody and anybody. At about 2 a.m. I decided it was to go home. I wanted to get some sleep before school the next day. When I got home I went to my bedroom and lied down I couldn't sleep. I no longer felt high I just couldn't sleep, I was wide awake. So I turned on my T.V. and watched pointless boring shows until 6.

I decided to take a shower because I had sweat quite a bit over the night. I must have still been a little high because the water felt so good on my skin. I got ready and headed off to school with an extra 20 dollars received from my sister. That morning I met chris outside at the smoker's end of the school we sat back and had a couple smokes and decided that we needed more 'cookies'. So at lunch we went out for a smoke and asked around a kid named Morgan said he could get 3 for 25$. So he called his dealer and we had to walk to his house. We got there and I got 2 green infinities and 1 red infinity. I decided I was going to parachute half of a green infinity. We left the dealers house to go back to school.

When I got to school I began felling very happy about how things were going. Me and Chris decided half a pill wouldn't get us high enough so I bit the red one in half swallowed it and gave the other half to chris. I went to my next class feeling like I was floating on a cloud. About 20 minutes into the class the red pill began to kick in. I sat in the back next to Megan I began laughing and talking about anything that would come to mind. After class we have a break I spent it talking to Dan a kid who was very unlikely to do any drugs. I had thought that I was acting perfectly normal but within 2 minutes of our conversation Dan had asked if I was high. I smiled and walked away to my next class. Again I spent this class sitting in the back with my friend Noah talking about anything that would come to mind. The class passed along uneventfully. After school I went home I devided I wasn't going to do the other green one until tomarrow wanting to sleep tonight. I slept like a baby from 10 pm to 6 am. First thing I did when I got up was take my last pill. I decided this was the last pill I was ever going to take a school.

By the time I got to school I was flying. I spent my two morning classes in a daze. At lunch some prep kids came tto me so I could pick up 3 grams for them. I went to southend and asked Chris if anyone had biscuits here at school. We quickly found a supplier (the same from the party). I bought 1 doublestacked afroman. I downed it right there. I met my buddy Jeremy and bought 2 grams off of him. He asked if I had pitches so I walked down the bike path and smoked a 5 piece along with 5 other people all of whom were also pitching.

By the time I got back to school I was totally fucked outta my tree. I met the prep kids and gave them a gram and a half telling them it was 2 grams and that I had gotten punched in the face just to get that for them. That seemed to satisfy them. The rest of my day was spent totally screwed up not knowing what to do. I did manage to get through my classes with no trouble though and got home safetly. That night was when the trouble started. I couldn't sleep. I now realize that the afroman pills were probablly laced with something like speed. I thought of a way that I could get money using my bank acount. So at 1 in the morning I ran all the way to the bank and took out 40 dollars saying to myself this was the last time I ever did ecstasy in my life. I probablly slept 2 hours that night.

When I got to school I went straight to the dealer (no need to go through Chris). I bought 3 pills for 30 dollers. 2 red mersades doublestacked and 1 afroman double stacked. Right in the school bathroom I swallowed a red mersades and chewed off half the afroman. I began to kick in during my first period class and I was gone. Out of my mind high it was incredible it was like my whole mind had change a perspective. I was seeing the world for the way it was for the first time. I went to the caffeteria and bought a pop so I had something to wash away the pasties. Right in the middle of my 2nd period class I remeber swallowing down the other half of the afroman. Then lunch began. 

I had 12 dollars left so I bought a gram and some cigarettes I then went down the bike path again and spent a full 50 minutes smoking weed continuously. I also swallowed the red mercades. The rest of my day at school was so screwed up I can't even remeber any of it. I was 17 minuted late for my 3rd period class and 23 minuted late for my fourth. I got home and turned on the T.V I didn't move I just lied there. Until around 11 pm when my mom had finally gone to sleep I realized I had no money left for tomarrow so once again I got my bank card ran all the way to the bank took out 20 dollars then ran back. I didn't sleep that night at all. 

The next day at school I met the dealler and bought two red mersades. I parachuted 1 of them in the bathroom at the start of school. People all day were telling me I looked awful like I was really sick (probablly was). At lunch I went down to the library a swallowed the other pill. I spent lunch sitting in a chair by myself. I can't remeber anything thing from that point on. I know this much I went to my 3rd period class but before going in Megan saw me in the hallway she ended up skipping class with me and eventually walking me home. The next day I didn't go to school. It is now Monday I've been clean for 3 full days I plan to keep that way. I thanked Megan and appolgized to a couple of people today at school.

I fell very very sick. I hope that at least one person has read this whole thing and decided to be smart about the way they take there drugs. I got carried away. And no one should ever do that. I'm 15 years old and I'm going to be much smarter about the way I do drugs from now on.
