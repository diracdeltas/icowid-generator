It started in hellish torment and extreme sense of mental torture. In the end I made a complete surrender and ceased to cling to the self loved ones sanity life or death.The experience was transforming. From hellish torment I was plunged into ecstasy an ecstasy infinitely exceeding anything describable or anything I had imagined. Suddenly there dawned full awareness of three great truths which I had long accepted intellectually but never until that moment experienced as being fully evident.

These were:
1. An awareness of unity
2. an awareness of unutterable bliss
3. An awareness of all that is implied by the buddhist doctrine of dharmas.Namely that all things whether objects or mental or of sensory perception.

Are alike devoid of own being mere transitory combinations of of an infinite number of impulses.From there I was plunged into a state of bliss from which I returned some hours later feeling as if though I had been gone not for hours but for years.
