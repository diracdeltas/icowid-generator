A few months ago, A friend of mine pulled out of his pocket something that he called 'Morphine Pops.'  He was selling them for 10 dollars a piece and I decided to buy two of them.  A couple of days later, I split one of the 1200mg 'pops' with a friend of mine during a video editing class (I am in high school) that I was taking.  After about twenty minutes I started to feel great.  I had never done anything like this besides smoking some opium over the summer, and was very sumprsed about how good I felt.  After just chilling for about an hour, I had to go to calculus.  The first half-hour of calculus was just as good as it had been in the begining, but after that I started feeling nautious and had to leave class for a while because I was afraid that I was going to throw up.  This nausia lasted for a couple more hours, and made the whole thing not worth it.  

Later on that week, I split my other 'pop' three ways and had a much better experience.  Although the highs were not as high, there were no negitive side-effects as their had been before. Since then I have had codeine a few times, but try not to do that kind of thing too much.
