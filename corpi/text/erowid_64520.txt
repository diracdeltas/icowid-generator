I'm a female 65 years old. After many years of being depressed and overweight my doctor prescribed Ritalin mostly to help with my depression. They had a wonderful side effect! When I started taking them I stopped eating emotionally and compulsively something I had not been able to overcome for 30 years.  In the past year I've dropped 76 pounds. An added bonus for me was a total cure of 38 years of debilitating and chronic diarhea. How Ritalin worked to cure that condition I can only guess at. Maybe it's because of its effect the central nervous system.

Supposedly Ritalin works differently in adults than it does in children so I was told by my doctor. Depression caused me to be tired all the time and Ritalin took that tiredness away.  I believe the reason for the weight loss is that Ritalin increases the heart rate which would result if I were doing light aerobic exersise. 

Overall I'd say that for me this medication gets an A+.
