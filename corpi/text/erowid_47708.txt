It all started when my friend told me of this new drug he had, DMT, he gave me directions on how to use it, and I only payed 20 bucks for 8 grams of bark, and a dimebag. 

Once we found a location to do this around 7:45P.M. I boiled 2 pots of water one for the MAoi seeds [a lot of seeds] which I drank first the other for the 7 grams of bark that turned a dark red when it was finished brewing. They both tasted like shit, but got the job done. So to speed up the process we smoked a bowl. (I was the only one on DMT)

I started to notice it work 30 minutes later lights became brighter and I just noticed thinking became alot different, everything was seeming surrreal and I was doubting why I took it. For the next 2-4 hours I was completely in the drug. I was seeing alot of things, and hearing, cars passing by were buzzing and sometimes ringing like a phone very loudly as they went by. It was all just weird and surreal, the weirdest thing that happened was seeing a reg light completely transform into Colonel Sanders a 3D figure. I was standing there shocked. My friends were trying to get me to snap back into reality but I wanted to see this man for a little longer why ever he was there.

My dreams were pretty crazy at night seemed very real, but I can't say it was a bad experience just an odd one, but all fun at the same time.
