[Erowid Note: 
The "water extraction" method is ineffective in separating diethyl ether from the volatile hydrocarbon liquids/gases in "starter fluid". Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe use of volatile hydrocarbon gases: their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage.] 

My Ether experience goes back three years ago into time. I can't say it's so special but I can tell you it was funny. I almost never had to laugh while being intoxicated on THC, so for me that was a very surprising element of the experience. The Ether was free so we just took it and after watching 'Fear and loathing in Las Vegas' a couple of times I wanted to find out if it would be so strange as in the movie or that it was just bullshit that you couldn't walk anymore etc.

So I sniffed and I sniffed and I sniffed. Suddenly everything around me became very dizzy and I just fell on the ground feeling very weak. I don't know why but suddenly I started to laugh very hard and kept laughing for minutes. We were at my friend's place and he had a fan on the ceiling for cool fresh air that was spinning like hell. In the midst of my Ether Delerium (it is not like a trip, more like a delerium) I thought it was a helicopter spinning violently above me. Then my blood pressure rose up very high and my heart was ticking intense fast and hard so I began to worry. In about ten minutes everything was back to normal, so I did it again, but this time it was not so special anymore so I decided to never do Ether again.

It was a very funny experience that reminded me of poppers which I did once when I was eleven of twelve years old.
