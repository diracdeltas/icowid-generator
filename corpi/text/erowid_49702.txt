One day I was bored so I decided to go out and get some caffeine and maybe get a small buzz, well I took it and it did nothing for me except make my hands and fingers twitchy. well a few hours pass and I start to feel depressed. I just needed to sit down and I did, I got really hot for some reason and took my jacket off I started thinking about death and my family and everything and that it could all go down and everything and I tried to control it but it was hard and the bad thing was I knew it wasn't me but the caffeine, all in all it took another few hours for it to wear off, I am not trying this stuff again unless in a lower dosage.
