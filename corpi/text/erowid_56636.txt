I read <a href='https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=6983'>'Nick's' 2001 report titled 'out of it' and feel exactly the same way.

I have been taking 20mgs of Celexa for 3 months for severe anxiety. started taking birth control about a week or so ago and now feel so out of it. 

soon after taking the birth control, decided to start getting off Celexa and am on 10 mgs a day, hoping to totally go off. But simply cannot shake the exact feelings that Nick described.
