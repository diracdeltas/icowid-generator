I was bored today, looking for drugs somewhere in my house because I had an urge to get high, but didn't want to do Diphenhydramine again because I had earlier in the week and would like to keep my liver good.  After no success, I thought for a minute on one of the trip reports on oxygen I had read yeterday night.  Then I thought 'If even pure oxygen can make you slightly high, what about Carbon Dioxide, which I can get with ease?'
After this, I went to the kitchen and got a balloon.  I blew it up and kept it in my mouth.  I laid down, and took a hit out of the balloon, held it in as long as I could, and breathed it out in to the balloon slowly.  I did this a total on ten times with no oxygen.  

I let the air out of the balloon, breathed, and stood up.  I felt light as a feather.  I walked around a bit and noticed a small loss of coordination, like maybe a 100 mg dose of Diphenhydramine but without the heavy feeling associated with it.  I also noticed a very slight headache, probably caused by the lack of oxygen to the brain, and a dry mouth.
