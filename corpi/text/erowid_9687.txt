This isn't really an experience report, but rather a 'serving suggestion' for weed.  I like smoking weed by any means (joint, pipe, etc.), but by far the most relaxing way to smoke is with a bong.  I made myself a bong from a 1 1/2 ft tall plastic novelty drinking glass that had a wide base, thin neck, and a wide opening at the top.  I always filled it with a cup or two of water and enjoyed smoking a bowl on my bong, but one day I thought of something to make it even better: ice.

Simply add ice to the bottom of the bong, where the water goes.  I usually use around 7 cubes, about as much as I can without going more than 3/4 of the way up the neck of the bong.  Now when you take a hit, you can't even feel the smoke!  You'll take bigger hits than you normally do, and as a result get way higher off the same amount of weed.  I'm sure this will become your favorite way to smoke, too.
