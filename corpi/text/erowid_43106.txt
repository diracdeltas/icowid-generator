The high is so temporary, and it is not worth the comedown. Why do a few lines if it is going to leave me miserable, and needing more? There is no good end to it, no matter how much I do. It's horrible for me and even if I only do a few lines, when I wake up the next morning, I feel awful. The comedown gives me a headache. I felt on top of the world for a few minutes, and then I hated the world for the next 20. Not worth it. These after-effects only intensify with the more cocaine used. It leaves me cold, depressed, and irritable. It is a joke of a drug.
 
I don't think it's a fun experience. The few times I've done it, whether I took 3 lines or 8, it sucked. I regretted it because it ruined my night.
