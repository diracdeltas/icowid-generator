I was teaching English in Taiwan for the summer.  We would see the betel nut stands all over the roadsides.  People chewed the things like mad, and spit the juice all over.  Taxi drivers especially.  Anyway, we decided to try them out, so we went to a stand and bought a few bags.  If you don't know, it Taiwan they sell them from little glass-boxish stands staffed by hot (from a distance, at least) girls wearing basically their underwear.  

My buddies each chewed one nut, but I decided to just go a whole bag and stuff my mouth with about five of them, one after the other.  They didn't taste that bad, maybe a little odd.  They made a lot of red juicy spit in my mouth, which I spat out.  Within a few minutes, I had a little buzz going from them.  It's a stimulant, and it felt a lot like one time when I was a teenager and stuffed a whole tin of dip in my mouth.  Strong but not very, fun, and not long-lasting.  It was a good time, walking down the street with my friends, chewing the things, and acting stupid.  Thumbs up!
