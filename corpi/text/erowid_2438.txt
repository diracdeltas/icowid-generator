I tired Viagra this year just to see what all the hype was about. It could be used as an aphrodisiac because it litterally makes your dick get hard for like ten minutes and then when you have an orgasm it feels better than without it. There was also a weird side effect with me...it made me see every light as though it were an ultraviolet light...you know every light had that purple tinge to it. I know it isn't like an illegal drug but it is perscription and it did have some psychoactive effects.
