I had never done mushrooms before, prior to this experience, but I was looking for something mind-expanding, something different than weed or booze. Up to this point I had experienced no psychedelic trips, only some pretty intense marijuana. I ingested the shrooms in the company of 6 or 7 other friends who were all sober other than slightly buzzed off weed. We were in Whistler, BC in Canada for a snowboard camp, so the setting was very laid back, I had no stress and nothing like that manifested itself during my trip. I felt the effects start to come on about 20 minutes after ingestion. At first I just felt these intense waves crashing through my brain of raw energy. I become very preoccupied with different animals and entered something I called 'the chicken'. I never actually saw this chicken but this was the entity that controlled my trip. The chicken directed my activites and gave me directions. He was very friendly and I felt no hostility from it at any time. 

About 2 hours into the trip I felt an intense desire to learn French. I only knew several phrases but asked my friend to teach me French. At first he just joked around but then, through the course of about an hour and a half he proceeded to teach me basic conversational French. I found I had no trouble remembering any of the semantics or grammar, and can still speak enough french to get by now - about a week later. Somehow the mushrooms opened up my auditory learning centers and allowed an immense amount of knowledge to be absorbed in a very short time. My friend only had to repeat phrases once and I had them down perfect. I finally went back to my hotel room at about 2 in the morning and tripped till about 4. While lying in bed I saw these brilliantly blue colored moths with big probes flying in this swirling gauzy material. Finally, at about four I was able to sleep and when I awoke, all had returned to normal, but my French remained.
