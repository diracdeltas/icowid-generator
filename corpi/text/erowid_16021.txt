I was interested in trying Salvia D. So I went online and bought me a gram of 5x. Now I have read about this drug and even in very small doses, salvia is a potent drug. Well bullshit. At first I smoked a very tiny pinch and my head felt heavy. So then I smoked 2 more pinches. Nothing more that a heavy head feeling. So then I smoked some more. By the time I had smoked a half of a gram, I just gave up. SALVIA DID NOT WORK FOR ME. So then i had my friend come over. Nothing for him either. Did I have bad stuff or what? I got nothing! That sucks!
