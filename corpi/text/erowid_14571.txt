I ate 150 morning glory seeds at about 9:20pm. Around 10pm I smoked a joint of passion flower then one of damiana. I smoked the Passion Flower for the MAOI effect to increase the Morning Glory but im still not feeling those.

However at about 10:40 I took a joint worth of tobacco which had a few tiny bits of weed leaf in it. It had been in a tiny bag that had had a little weed in it. Smoking this joint I suddenly got totally fucked. I lost all balance but never got that up/giggly weed high. The effect was very intense but only lasted about 5 minutes. After a few more tokes I got horrible nausea and put it out. About 20 minutes later I smoked most of the rest. I lost some balance again but then I got reall sick. I swear I was going to puke, I havent thrown up in 3 years!

I stumbled indoors, drank some water and lay down fast. I felt so sick. Quickly I felt fine again and im writing this now at 11:20. I dont know what it was that caused this. I think the passion flowers effect on my MAO meant I could get very high off what was almost no weed at all in the tobacco joint but I think the tobacco made me feel very sick. Ive smoked weed and tobacco before and I never got that stoned for such a short time and never got sick off tobacco.

I got very scared about mixing the MAO inhibiting Passion Flower. I dont think Ill try this combination ever again, the nausea was terrible but lasted about 2 minutes. All I can say is. Strange. I got so stoned off of let me repeat, about 10 little bits of weed leaf, tiny bits, in tobacco. Maybe cause I put the tobacco in this little bag for a few days, I dont know. But I dont recommend u try this. The nausea was horrific.
