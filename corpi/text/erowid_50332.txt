I have been addicted to her for 2 years.  I call it 'her' because it's exactly what the drug feels like to me.  When I have her in me life is warm, loving and easy.  When I run out or when I forget to bring her along with me, life sucks, to be honest.

I have a steady supply, but right now poor timing has caused me to have a 3 day period without the drug.  I am on the second day and this is pretty difficult.  I'm counting the hours until my new supply arrives tomorrow.  The problem is my tolerance has gradually risen.  First it was one or two 50mg pills a day maximum.  Now to get the 'high' I need five or six. It's my way of self-medicating, but what scares me is I know I can't live like this forever.  Eventually I will have to stop.  But I don't know if I can do it.
