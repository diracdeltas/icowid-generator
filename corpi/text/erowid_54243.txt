Hello all in search of the wormwood experience. I happen to be on my secound cup of wormwood tea. My mom grows the plant in her garden and I had heard of it before and that it has psycoative potential. I took a few big leaves off and finely chopped them and mixed them with some other loose tea (in a metal steeper). I let this sit for 10-15 min. and drank it down. The taste was foul. The most bitter thing ever to grace the earth. I mixed in a couple of teaspoons of sugar. This surpressed the bitterness abit. The experience is a bit like alcohol but with a great body buzz and dreamlike sensations. I love it and reccommend it. That is all for now!
