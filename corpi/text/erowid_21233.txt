A few years ago when a famous poisonous non-consumables supplier was offering tramadol, I ordered 10g for a little less than 100USD.  I am not sure what the quality was, but I found 500mg to be the right dose.  I had read that the high it produced was similar to oxycodone. 

While I can see some resemblance, the effects of ultram are a lot more subtle.  On the bright side it seems to have less of the stomach queasiness and body load that comes with most opiates.  I liked to lie in bed after ingesting 500mg and 2ml bdo which would put me in a state very similar to a normal opiate nod.  The itching, the warmth, a mild euphoria and even some weak visions.  

From reports I've read the pills from overseas might be of better quality.  It would be interesting to see what ultram and carisoprodol combos are like, as neither are federally controlled.

As a side note: about a year ago I read in the paper that someone in my hometown was charged with forging drug documents to obtain ultram - so there are people who like it enough to commit crimes for it.
