I had heard about DXM and I had found a half full bottle of delsym in my pantry. I drank the bottle at about 10:30 PM consuming about 270 mg of DXM. After taking it I got on AIM and was talking to my friend for about an hour. An hour later I still didn't feel much. I laid in bed and began to feel a little floaty. Sometimes when I looked at something everything would just turn to gray fuzz. I got up and turned the light on in my bathroom and just stood there and stared at myself for a little bit. I began to feel a little dissociated with my body, but all these things were very mild. My eyes didn't look any different. I went and laid down again and immediately fell asleep. It was an extremely lame experience and I'm bummed out that those 270 mgs of DXM were wasted. I guess next time I'll just have to have more.
