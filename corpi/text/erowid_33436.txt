It was aproximately 9:00 at night, I was waiting patiently with my boyfriend for one of my friends to bring the deal down as we had agreed to one week prior. She showed up and the deal went down smooth and perfect. In my purse I now held meth, my second run with it. Jim and I were preparing our bodies for prom losing the weight that we had put on since the last time we casually snorted lines.

After a few moments of pleading, I convinced him to start that night, snorting a line and a half just like last time. When we got home, we took out the old 'speed set' Crystals Mirror, as we call it, a joke to D&D players. The lines went down smooth as silk inviting a high unlike any other I had experienced!

I got hit with the shakes at first, which I knew was going to happen because it happen every time I got hit with the shakes at first, which I knew was going to happen because it happen every time I ran over a few speed bumps. After he finished his line we went outside for a few renditions of 'Semi-Charmed Kinda Life' much to my neighbors dismay. After that he went home, to finish his Java script paper, and I did laundry, well into the wee hours of the morning. That high kept me going until about 5:30, when I snorted another line.

I went to school after that, taking with me my antique prayer ring, having made it water tight it is the only way to go. At school, at about 12:00 I did yet another line, hoping it would keep me going for the rest of the night. I was wrong, and timed it so wrong. By the time my boyfriend appeared at the door after he got off of work I was crashing, it was 9:00, and I was a mess. Frustrated, agitated, and craving like mad I could hardly stand to see him, with his rules about not snorting too much without him, this was for us to share. I was livid. We tried everything to make me feel better, after we recognized it was the crash we snorted again. And here I am typing.
