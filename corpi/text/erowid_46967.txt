I was home by myself so I thought I would try codeine. I had 6 tylenol 3 at hand so I just took them all. I didn't feel anything for an hour, so I took a shot of Vodka. After about another half hour felt a little dumber but that is about it. No euphoria or anything. Maybe I'll try it sometime with 300-400 mg. Otherwise it is just a waste of time.
