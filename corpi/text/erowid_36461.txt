My god, were to begin? Well, my mother got prescribed Tramadol for back pains, though she rarely took them, maybe 4-5 times a month. There were 30 tramadols in each prescription every month, leaving me 25 out of 30 pills, for my own pleasure. As long as I remember, Tramadol was simply sublime. Truly in every way, was this drug golden. 

I first started with 150 MG and it felt similar to a small-to-moderate dose of Percocet, but without the sleepiness and nausea. It begins to kick in usually half an hour after ingestion. If I took after eating, it usually took longer to kick in (obviously). I usually never ate anything with it, because I was so excited for the effects to come on. 

An hour after the onset, I feel extremely happy, and I can talk to anyone in this entire world. I am a sort of shy person, but on this, I could interact socially with anybody. As the months went by, I gradually increased my dose, and usually did 400 MG, 5 times a week. A little more on the effects, the feeling is similar to Opiates (lortab, percocet, codeine), the happy feelings, the body buzz, the loss of pain, the euphoria, and I could go on. 

For about 6 hours, I feel great, and when I sit still I can feel physical pleasure. Sometimes it's in my back, sometimes my legs. This pleasure is very random with areas in the body it will act upon, which makes Tramadol so interesting. There Is one thing that makes this drug fascinating...6-10 hours after ingestion, it's like nothing in the world can get ME down. I'm just so happy. It's like a low dose of E, as I have experienced with E many times before. 

There are very few downsides to the drug, which include difficulty reaching orgasm (as I have tried with my girlfriend), plus sex just doesn't feel as good. Why I think it doesn't feel as good, is because I'm already way happy and feeling great, so sex wouldn't feel too amazing, when on Tramadol. Tramadol is almost like a constant orgasm, but not as intense. 

Another downside is mild constipation, but a little fiber will do the trick in fixing that. To this day, I am a huge fan of Tramadol, and have tried from 150 MG - 600 MG, the higher the dose, the better the effects and longer it will last. Sometimes it would last me into the next day (even if I have slept). I'm so grateful I came upon this drug, and that my mom hasn't seemed to notice the missing pills. 

Tramadol is Grade A+, It's my hero.
