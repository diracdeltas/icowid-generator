This is how it all began:

Monday 4:30 pm: popped 2 2mg Xanax, then after that half a bar(1mg)

I got back from class at 6:30pm, so I halved a 10mg Methadone and snorted it(man it burnt like a motherfucker!)

40 minutes later I took 2 more 2mg bars while typing an essay. Miraculously, I finished it without a problem(ain't that some shit?!)

At about 10pm, I picked up 10 more Xanax from my friend's mom and proceded to take 1 - 2mg and a half a bar.

Got home without a problem! By 11:00pm, I was totally mind fucked and kept stumbling around with very blurred vision to try to find my cigs. Damn, that was a long adventure. Took me 30 goddamn minutes to find them. So I went outside and smoked a whole pack of basics lights in 1 hour(felt relaxing).

12:50am Took the other half of the the 5mg Methadone

Now it is 1:44am, and completely disoriented, but I was very relaxed and euphoric often forgetting things. But it didn't matter.

Overall, I experienced no negative reactions whatsoever.
