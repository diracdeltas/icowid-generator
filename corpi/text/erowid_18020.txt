First of all, at 6 o'clock(damn its hard to type on this stuff)anyway, at 6 o'clock I ate 3 grams of amanita thinking it would be potent enough.  Well it wasn't.  I felt some effect (Iknew I wasn't sober) I gave it two hours.  Then I ate around 7 more grams throughout 8-9:30.

It is 11:00.  I am pretty fucked up.  The high creeps very slowly.  I am very lazy and my mouth is watering a lot.  Its actually watering, well,  U know when you get really drunk, and your about to puke and your mouth waters non stop?  In a way that you can't control.  Basically, if I bent over and held my mouth open, my mouth would pour water (not stretchy saliva) out. Basically, if I bent over and held my mouth open, my mouth would pour water (not stretchy saliva) out.  I do not have any hallucinations occurring but I do feel very spinny as if I were drunk.  Walking is a bitch.  I think I ran into the wqlls about ten or so times.  I am now feeling very nausious and it won't stop.  I'm sweating a lot and my nose has been watering for awhile.  It feels goosd to close my eyes (it makes me feel better in the stomach).

........5minutes just passed by.  I was laying over the trash can almost puking.  I feel a little better now.  My body is very numb (fingertips, face, feet ..etc..) this drug is getting pretty intencse.  Still no hallucinations.  Over all this drug is just like being intoxicated.  I'd rather drink a bottle of bacardi dark. This drug does not give me any lsd or lsa effect.  It is just like drinking with a different kick.  Meaning, my mind is able to think (unlike being drunk)  I'm pretty sure the high will not go any further now.  It was deffinitely a cool drug to try once.  I basically just feel as if the drug has poisoned me........  Well, alright......I'm gonna go play some dark drum and bass and meditate.  Peace and cheers!
