Many weeks previous to this encounter I acquired 2 10mg Adderall pills from a much smaller and female friend, who had a prescription. I waited to use the pills often because of the reports of extreme changes to mood, and other outwardly visible factors. When I finally decided to try to use the pills, I had an english essay due the next day, so after a full meal (pasta with a high fat and high protein sauce), I decided to take one 10mg dose. Early into the experience I was mostly nervous, and assured myself that I was just experiencing a placebo effect. After about a half an hour, I still had not felt any noticeable difference, and was just as off task as I could have been, I was engaged in a conversation with a long time user, who talked to me about the effects and about other psychoactives. I felt the effects as if I were simply not tired (During school I often do not get enough sleep). The effects were similar to if I had a nap and an energy drink, I was fidgety (although I usually am, to a similar degree) and I was otherwise normal. This may be partially because I spent most of the experience sitting, and when I did stand I walked only a few feet. I also was in a quiet room and was attempting to do something that I had no interest in doing. These could be contributing factors to my limited experience.

In future experiences I may increase the dosage because 10mg seems to be a very small dosage by comparison, and it understandably caused few results.
