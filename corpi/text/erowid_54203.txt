I used to take an acid in the morning on my way to school every day for about 2 years. A dealer used to give me it for free if I protected his son at school. 

I must have been an absolute nightmare to deal with. I can remember that every day as I walked into regestration it would start to kick in and it was more than once that the room would appear to me to be a butchers freezer and everyone in the room was just meat hanging on hooks. This might sound grim but at the time I loved it. It seemed to make me very violent and extremely arrogant. I treated the whole place like a brothel I could also beat people up in. The meat was just there hanging waiting for me to do a rocky and start beating on it.

I have since found out that everyone at my school including the teachers were terrified of me. On one occasion I dove off a twenty foot wall onto a crowd of children breaking my collarbone but still attacking everyone, banging their heads together and kicking into them. Eventually the school managed to expell me and I don't blame them. I'm just lucky that they never phoned the police on me. I've never spoke to anyone else that had violent rages on acid but I'm sure I'm not the only one. I haven't touched acid in years and don't intend to again. It's one thing to behave like that at 13-14 but not as an adult. They'd lock me up and throw away the key. 13 years on and people still act scared of me.
