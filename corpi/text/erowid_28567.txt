This is a general Story Relate to AMT.

In Roughly February of 2002 Two men were shot and killed by their friends.

The Reason. The two victims had large quantities of Pot Growing in their home. The Two assailants Were on Fairly large doses of AMT and in fact had been on a constant high from many smaller doses. The two attackers were friends with the two victims. But thru joking about taking the victims pot, the idea escalated till the two attackers thought it was actually a really good idea and ended up shooting their two friends. killing them, stealing their stuff and then getting life in jail.

This happened in Puna, Hawaii.

in other words, sure it can be fun to try things. but AMT is one hell of a psycotic drug and can really leave you thinking absolutly retared things for a while after seemingly coming down.
