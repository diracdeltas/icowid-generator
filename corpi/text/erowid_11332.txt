A Relaxing Experience With Different Herbs

I had bought a bag of catnip a while ago and used it with weed a few times. The effect was nothing big just a calmer high. My best catnip experience was this december.
 
Me and a friend had smoked 3 bowls of weed about 2 hours before. We were out of weed except a little shake in one of my bags. Neither one of us were high any more. We were in my room with nothing to do so we packed a bowl of catnip. We used my dad's old tobacco pipe which had some tobacco at the bottom. We mixed the tobacco and catnip and smoked that bowl, each hit tasted fine but somewhat harsh on the throat, I dont smoke tobacco so it was probably that. I felt calm after a few hits so we packed more catnip and put any extra weed I had in there. I read that chamomile is relaxing so I took that from a tea-bag and packed that too. The bowl now had weed, chamomile, catnip, and tobacco. It was a big bowl and we each had about 7 hits. 

I started feeling extremely relaxed. I turned all the lights off except for my lava lamp and put on music. We smoked 2 more bowls of catnip and chamomile, I'm an experienced smoker but it still hurt my throat. After we stopped we both felt very calm and just listened to music in the light of the lava lamp. It felt like a light weed high but toned down to a very relaxed and chill state. I just thought about the lyrics to all the songs and really appreciated the music. I felt really chill and relaxed for about 2 hours just sitting there. <!-- I highly reccomend this mix for anyone who runs out of weed. -->It was a really good experience and I'll definetely do it again.
