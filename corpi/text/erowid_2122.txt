ok, it wasn't something I would do again but for someone who is bored and hasn't done it yet, do it...get some ground up nutmeg, from a health store or even walmart McCormick style...anyways...its terrible going down but after about an hour the giggles start kicking in like your high for your first time or like if you ate a lame ammount of shrooms and was just getting the pretrips with small tracer hallucinations and wierd noises...it lasts a while and you get sloppy the less sleep you get, meaning the later you stay up on it the more fucked up you get, when I woke up off of it I was still feeling pretty dazed and was a little stumbly the next couple days, it's a fun thing to do with some friends and just laugh about how you're getting fucked up off of nutmeg, I suggest everyone try it once and after that it will be enough.
