I obtained a 1 mg tablet of Lorazepam on a day that I wasn't really feeling the greatest. I was in an upset state of mind, and needed something to kill the anxiety. I took the tablet with a partially full stomach not expecting much effect to occur because of the low dosage. I was feeling wide awake before I took the tablet, although I must also note it was around midnight when I took it.

T+0.5 hours:feeling relaxed, kind of numb, similar to the first effects of moderate dose of alcohol.

T+2 hours: Talking on the phone to a close friend, and when I close my eyes, my brain keeps visualizing really mundane things, knots tying, a car driving, the sky, really weird experience that words can not describe. I would call them hallucinations, but they were not really images, more or less thoughts I could actually see. Overall it was a good experience, made me feel much better and less anxious.
