Ketamine and Cocaine

I have been enjoying the combination of Ketamine and Cocain for some time now and I am surprised that I could not find another article on this combination. It is a popular combination in London where I'm from and is referred to as 'C.K' (after the fashion designer Calvin Klein). The effect is more physical than mental as the stimulatory effects of the cocaine seems to increase the users tolerance to the depressive effects of the ketamine but not completely, so it becomes more difficult to enter a K-hole but mental perception is still reduced as such it enhances one awareness of the more pleasant relaxing physical effects of ketamine. As a result this combination is fast becoming popular in a social setting in houses and on the club scene where one can 'keep up and moving' rather than sitting or lying down unable or unwilling to move.  

As a user I can report what I can only describe as a very pleasant warm glowing golden feeling in my whole body that feels absolutely amazing. Too much leads to a feeling of 'jelly-ness' in the muscles and mind - but again the consciousness is there the whole time.<!-- - so I would recommend that you should start with combining a small line of the two and taking it from there.--> Also I have found that since the K begins to work faster than the cocaine that it is best to have a 'primer' line of cocaine to get things going before combining the two.
