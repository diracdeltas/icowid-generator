I am what you say a pill-popper, and my weapon of Choice is Vicodin or Darvon(Propoxyphene). I had been taking 10 Ultrams a day for about 5 months just to get the same effects of a normal dose of Vicodin, mainly due to my size,(I'm a big guy). Well needless to say one day I felt like going into a mad trip, and took 22 tabs of Ultram, well I made it thought school without anything bad happening. I got home and laid down to watch some Television and maybe take a quick nap. Next thing I know I was woken up by a paramedic asking me if I knew where I was, and I knew right then I was in an ambulance with my mother by my side. I had my stomach pumped in the hospital and was told by my mother I went into a seizure In out kitchen, which I don't remember.
