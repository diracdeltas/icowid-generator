That was a great conference - amount of positive energy in there proved me that many other people benefited as me from this substance.

Peace and smiles on everybody's faces and that particular feeling of openness and interconnection are the memories that I'll keep forever in my heart.

That was a meeting of faithful community (or tribe as one of the speakers said) and it would be great if it could prevail in cyberform.
