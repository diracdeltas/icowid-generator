A while back at an outdoor festival in California, I with some freinds boiled down some San Pedro. After having discovered that we had the weak variety that is only mildy psychoactive on its own, we decided to try it again with some caapi vine that we had purchased.

It took half and hour to an hour for the initial effects to realy start comming on. I felt none of the nausea that I have read about with the syrian rue and pedro reports....though this paticular cactus was not nearly as bitter as some of the others we had experimented with in the past. Nobody threw up.
 
The initial sensation was one of expanded consciousness and euphoria. I felt intense energy in my heart, and throughout my nervous system.  This mixture felt more like e, except on a higher vibrational level of the heart and mind, rather then the body and heart. 

It got alot more powerful. The energy I felt was intense. I felt like my mind and heart opened up, and I was experiencing all kinds of energy in myself and people around me. It wasnt especially visual, but was incredibly euphoric. It was definitely a psychedelic as far as its effects on my psyche, but it was more of an internal psychedelic rather then a visual one. It definitely changed my perception....

The next day I felt great. Better then great, I was relaxed, happy, and content with the same energy presence that I felt in my solar plexus area. The afterglow lasted two more days, and felt good the entire time without any real hangover.

I recomend this mixture over the rue San Pedro one. The only thing I would recomend is watching dosage, as overdose is definitely possible if one is using the same amount of cactus one would be using without the MAOI.

A friend of mine had said....'I could be higher....but not much'.
