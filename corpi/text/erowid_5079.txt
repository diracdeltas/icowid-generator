This is a trip i did two years ago with my brother D and two of my best friends C and N. We had bought 3 grams of Copelandia (Panaeolus) Cyanescens from a smart drugstore in Sweden where Copelandia still was legal. The evening came and we gathered in my friend N's home and ingested the shrooms, a little over 0.5 grams of Copelandia each.

18.00- We ate the mushrooms which were dried and tasted horrible. I must say that these shrooms taste much worse than both semilanceata and cubensis. But the effects are also very much heavier.

18.30- the first effects started to come for most of us, except for C who i think was to exited and a little worried about the whole thing. The first effects were minor visual changes. Things started to move and breath and a sort of euphoria came on. Everybody started to laugh, and very soon even C felt the effects.

19.00+ The effects got much more intense and everybody took it quiet and listened to music; mostly music from the 60's-70's like Pink Floyd and Moody Blues.

20.00 The effects were now at the peak i think for all off us and we decided to go outside and take a walk. the walk was very interesting and fun. Everything was living, cars, lights and looking to the stars was amazing. We took the way into the woods where the lights from the village ended up into darkness, but at our surprise the was a full moon and that aded some to the trip. C started to see cartoon characters in the woods and that was all he talked about. i must say that this was in the winter and everything looked sharp and crispy.

21.00 The trip was still going quite strong but it had past it's peak and we were all laying back at N's plays and rested from the walk listening to music.

We were all very satisfied with the trip and we have done it many times after that, and i must say that these mushrooms are the strongest we've ever seen.
