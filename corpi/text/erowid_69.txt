It was the second time I used nitrous.  I knew a tank was at this party..everyone did.  The first time I used nitrous was a month and a half before this party.  I was very nervous and I didn't totally inhale fearing the experience it would provide.  I have an addictive personality and knew I would probably love it.

My boyfriend and I got a deal for $50 for the both of us, unlimited balloons the whole night.  I smoked pot before hand and this intensified the effect so much more. Once I started with the balloons, I could not stop. At a couple points in the night I was found with two balloons at one time. The feeling is compared to the very beginning of a good 'roll.'  That is why you crave more.  The warm, euphoric, lethargic, sedation felt wants to be repeated over and over and over until you are dragged away.  Oddly enough, I had visions of when I was a child.  Each time I did nitrous, I had a vision of a baby carriage which was a picture I had in my room of when I was young.  Not easy for many people to understand when I tell them.  It just set me free, how I felt as a little girl. It felt good to stop for a moment and come back to reality, realizing it might be time to stop...but not being able to.  The honest after feeling is just one of sedation and true 'air-headedness.'  I found myself calling my mother trying to have a decent conversation to make myself feel normal again the next day.

This was the most I have ever and ever will do.  Each time I did this inhalant I had an unexpected problem sleeping.  I did not remember falling asleep the night I did it and I had trouble falling asleep the night after.  It may have been my mind wondering and worrying if my lost brain cells will ever return?  I mean, we use less than 3% of our brains anyway, right....:)
