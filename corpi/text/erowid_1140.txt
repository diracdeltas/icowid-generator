Ok, the trip was fine, but what I am trying to get across is the manner in which I smoked it.

If you have a 1000 milliliter flask or larger, this will work perfectly. You can get one from school or buy one or something. Anyway, you'll also need a few cans or something metal to rest it on, not to mention a lighter, plasic bag, elastic band, a sock, a spritzer and a lot of baking soda. Anyway, you put the herb (maybe a nick) in the flask and tilt the flask so all the weed is in a corner. Put the bag over the top of the flask, and the elastic band tightly around the bag. Put some baking soda in the spritzer, and add water. Shake the spritzer to mix the baking soda and water. Put the spritzer on the misty setting. Put a lot of baking soda in the sock and tie it off. Spritz the bulb of baking soda in the sock until its pretty damp. You'll exhale through this sock later, the water catches a lot of the particles, the baking soda neutralizes the smell. Now hold the lighter or candle up to the flask (which should be on a metal support so it doesn't burn something) and wait until there is a lot of vapor in the flask. Suck all the vapor up, and exhale through the big part of the sock, the part with baking soda in it, to minimize smell. Then spritz like hell to get rid of the smell. This will get you pretty high and you can do it anywhere you will be alone for at least twenty minutes. Just be sure to wash out the flask with baking soda and water.
