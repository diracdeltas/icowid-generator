Basically i'm just writing this to see if what happens to me happens to others and to let people know that if they've experienced this its not a singular as it seems to be for me.  I've rolled 2 time in my life, once about a year ago, and once this past week.  The first time i did it i took half of a pill and felt fine while on it but 2 days later i had a panic attack and so i was affraid to do it again.  i also experienced some muscle spasms...not severe or anything, just annoying and they subsided over time.  
Then, 2 days a go i took 2 pills in one night and the twitches or spasms are back and i've felt weird and out of it but not uncontrollably.  I dont really have a point...just wanted to say that if you feel panicky after your roll your not alone.
