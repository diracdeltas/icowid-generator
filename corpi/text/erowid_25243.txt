when i first started out, it was just a fun thing to do on a weekend or so just to have fun. Me and my friends would usually get around 2.0 grams to 3.5 grams for the night and split it up with us. this was fun for a while intill it started to become a need instead of a want. Soon we were doing it every day, stealing money to get a gram and then snort that in an hour and then withdrawl intill we had more money. i was using every day and i didnt sleep sometimes for days on ends. Soon it started to become a problem with my family also. they started suspecting me of drug use and now i had to live a false life. Then relationships with friends slowy started to dissapear to the point where the only reason your hanging out is because the other person / or you has coke/ or money to get coke. soon friends where stealing from eachother , up intill the point where fights broke out over coke. 

im now proud to say im clean, but broke, but still clean. I still get cravings , some so bad where i cant sleep because i cant get it out of my head. i wish i never would have started.
