I was looking for a cheap alternative to weed, being that my monetary funds had been drained into car repairs.  The idea actually came to me by watching my cats after a dose of the nip.  I figured - hey man- its worth a shot.  So I rolled about half a cubic inch into a zig zag and smoked it with a pair of tweezers - I wanted a heavier concentration quicker, cause I figured catnip wasn't gonna be too strong.  Well, I was partially right.  In terms of the high effect, catnip is like nil.  After 2 more such joints, I had a very light, pleasant, and minty wisp in my throat.  I was also calm and happy.  Its good stuff for what it costs.
