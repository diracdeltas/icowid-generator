My Love, Cocaine

I've tried many things in my life, but I've never really been addicted to anything. I smoke cigarettes regularly, and I've also tried weed, shrooms, Vicodin, and E. None of those drugs can compare to my liking for coke. Even though I don't consider a coke high to be anything spectacular, compared to the other drugs I've tried, it's the most satisfying high. When I'm on coke, I am still able to control myself. People could never tell I was on it, but they did notice a difference in my personality. I'm seemingly more pleasant and energetic when I'm on coke. This is very beneficial to me, since I am as antisocial as they come. There aren't many bad side effects I can think of either, except for maybe the occasional nose bleed or the slow deterioration of my septum. Haha. The only other thing that I dislike about this drug, is the addictive nature of it. I can't go a day without it, and this causes me to go broke before the week has ended.<!--I suggest that if you are ever planning to even try coke, you have to be aware that one sniff can set your addiction. Be careful.-->
