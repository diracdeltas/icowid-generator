Leaving you was just so fucking hard
I cried and I begged, I lied and fell apart
Yet no one trusted me
Only I could see
That you were what I needed
No matter how much I pleaded
I want your touch on my lips and in me
I've never had such fill me like you did
I have to hold my chest and my heart
When you are going through me
Now alone I fell apart
You were my serenity
No one understands our love as a whole
That without you I have no control
And you without me are craved by many
But they just don't see 
That you are mine
And without you, in my eyes there is no shine
Now I just wanna die
Without you by my side
I cannot lie
I feel no pride
I can't go on
I lament your consumption
I mourn because I can't return
My heart and my mind still yearn
Everyone has their presumptions
It is all true
I am addicted to you
