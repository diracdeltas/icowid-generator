My anxiety was really bad one night, so I decided to take seven .5 mg of my alprazolam.  Well as the night progressed I took 3 more and then 5 more. So at this point I was on 7.5 mg of it. I vaguely remember what happened that night but I do remember going to get a bunch of food and then talking to my boyfriend on the phone.  I'm pretty sure that he'll break up with me because he knows I have a problem. At that point I assume I blacked out in my bed and for the next day I felt still really, really sedated. The next night I figured that I would take the remaining 15 pills that I had left and quit alprazolam cold turkey but when I looked around I couldn't find my pill bottle anywhere. For some reason I checked in the trash thinking that maybe I threw it in there in a drugged-up haze and I found that I had no pills left. I had totally forgotten that I downed the entire bottle.  I had done it before but this time really scared me because it was way more than my body could handle. I'd say that I'm lucky to be alive.
