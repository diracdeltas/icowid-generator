Crazy Night

May 20th is my birthday and I wanted to hang out, ya know chill with my homiies eat some shrooms, get wasted, and just have a good night if you know what I mean. I woke up around 11:00 and got a ride to the heights around 12:00pm. After around 2:00pm I got the mushrooms and waited till aound 5:30pm and ate the shrooms with about 7 other people trippin balls!! This is my 5th time on mushrooms and the most horrorifing thing ever!I ate them on an empty stomache and drank a couple beers ya know thought I was having a good time.  Then all of a suddon it hitt me I felt like everyone hated me I was so scared of everyone I felt like I was on a rollercoaster going 100mph in every single direction, getting tossed around like a rag doll and seeing a blur of collors. Then I felt like a had to vomitt so I fell down and puked on the ground. After I looked and the shroom I threw up looked like it was growing bigger and bigger. My sister noticed I was having a bad trip so she helped me and got me a blanket to lay down on.

Part 2 
I fell alseep for prolly about 20 minutes it felt like ,and woke up and was still tripping face with my sister right there by my side.  My 2 friends I work with in woodstock met up with me and I gave the rest of the bag to them. They ate the bag and tripped face till we got back to my friends house  and we chilled up in his tree fort for for a couple hours I think?? We bought some weed and smoked about an 8th and came online to write this report! I'm starting to get tired and right now I'm just thinking about everything and everything about everything!

4:00 AM want to go to bed!! Good night~!
