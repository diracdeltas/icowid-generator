My friend had told me about Salvia and I became very curious.  I went online and read about it.<!--came to this web page and read about it.-->  I decided to try it my plan was to take bong hits, first one very small, then each time increase the amount.  I took a total of four.  

1st hit, slight tingle
2nd hit, slight tingle, feel pressure to my left side of body.
3rd hit, slight tingle, feel pressure moving around my body

4th hit, this one was the biggest one, as I was holding it I knew something powerful was about to happen, I mentally told myself to remain calm and not to stand up as I was not using a sitter.  I exhaled the the hit.  I felt a rush move through my body like I was moving forward, and visually the room stretched and appeared to move towards me(a strong hallucination), then I felt like I moved backwards, then down, then up.  The room visually stretched with me in those directions.  Looking straight forward everything was normal It was in the corners of my field of vision, Like tunnel vision.  

My first experience was like a combination of Nitrous, a massive hit of cannabis, and a bit scary like moving into a bad acid trip.<!--I would suggest strongly if you are inexperienced with hallucinogens to use a sitter, and dont stand up while you feel the effects of this herb.  Respect this herb, its potent effects hit you very fast and hard.-->  This herb deserves respect, it hit me very fast and hard.
