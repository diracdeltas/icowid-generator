Recently I got ahold of some zyprexa from  a buddy whos been on meds for ten years. He told me it was like valium, and its in the same family of drugs as valium. I waited until a boring week night to drop it. I took two ten mg pills- a good size dose. Sure enough within about 45 minutes the faliliar drunky, sedated feelings showed up- just like valium. I went to sleep and woke up at 9 am the next morning very groggy. It was just like valium in its effects but one major difference: it lasts a long time. I didn't feel back to normal until about 5 p.m. that day. I don't think I'll do it again but the mellow sedation it gave was certainly interesting.
