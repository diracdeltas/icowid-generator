6 days ago, I decided to smoke the ice that I purchased two weekends ago.  I split a 40sack (I don't know weights, but whatever a 20 sack is, that's what I got) with a girl and brought the rest home.  Another friend brought a new glass pipe over to smoke the ice out of, she smoked two hits that night I didn't smoke any.  She reported feelings of being amped, but didn't think she had done enough to get the full effects (she did clean up my apartment though :) ) the next day around 2pm, I took two hits and felt great.  I didn't smoke anymore until approximately 8pm when a friend and his girlfriend came over.  We both took several hits over the course of an hour or so.  I think that overall, I took about 15 decent sized hits of ice.  I felt great, euphoric, I did the dishes, I was so amped. But it wasn't worth the come down.  Strong feelings of suicide accompianed the comedown (which eventually occured around 10am the next day).  I smoked a quarter ounce of hydro that day, trying to get the bad feelings to go away.  I still feel drained and exhausted (6 days later). I have no desire to repeat the experience, I think my experience with ice steered me away from harder drugs for the time being.
