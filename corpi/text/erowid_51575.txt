Hi, this is to tell you the story of three best friends who liked to party. I like coke and ecstacy a lot. One of my friends drinks waaay too much. The third one, well, she went for whatever. Shana went to N.Y., she was a designer and was getting pretty big. She was modelling and was a very popular party-celebrity. She was very beautiful. She started doing crystal. A lot. Then she wouldn't get out of the house, saying the government was trying to get her killed.

Nobody knows what really happened that night, we weren't with her, but she ended up in the hospital for a long time, and has never been the same since. She says that jealous drag queens tried to kill her, by putting poison in her drugs (because she was too beautiful and popular) but she might also have tried to kill herself, overwhelmed with paranoia. I think she plain overdosed.      

She have been schizophrenic since: she hears mean voices in her head, hallucinates (her tv, her cats speaking to her) gets sudden, violent visions of her hurting people. She has lost everything: her clothing line, her boyfriend, all her money, apartment, furniture. When we take her out, the very same people that used to mooch us so much now laugh in her face, and she doesn't understand it. The worst is, she is still looking for some freakin' crystal. Of course we watch her, but it's a full time job. We have to stick around, because everybody else deserted her, I think it's really messed up. She really isn't the same and will never be again. She spent 2 years in psychiatric hospital, and she will never get better.
