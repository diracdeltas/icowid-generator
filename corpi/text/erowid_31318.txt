I take 100mg of Zoloft every night for depression. A friend of mine told me that her friend said that it's a pretty fun trip to snort it. When I got home that day I took one of my pills, crushed it up, carefully picked the coating out of the crushed pill and snorted a large line (about 25mg of the 100mg pill). I felt a HORRIBLE burning sensation in my nose which I had expected, but it didn't go away after a few minutes like I assumed. My right eye quickly became bloodshot and swollen, my throat was burning, and my sinuses were severly irritated. I flushed the inside of my nose with water, drank Sprite, and every few minutes I hung my head upside down off the side of my bed for a few minutes and the pain ceased slightly. The pain decreased slowly over the next 40 minutes. The right side of my nose was runny for the next 2 days afterwards. The moral of this story? DO NOT SNORT ANYTHING WITH A COATING ON IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO FEEL HELL BURNING IN YOUR NOSE
