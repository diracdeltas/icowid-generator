The first time I used this drug was to say the least: better than the second.

First time: My friend sent the night at my house and talked me into taking 16 pills. He can talk anyone into anything; he could have told me to shoot myself in the face and I'd probably do it. Once we each took the 16 pills it was going okay. I smoked about a half a bowl (of marijuana) and I was toasted. I was wearing a hooded sweatshirt and the drawstring kept moving around like a snake. I kept blacking out and my friend kept jerking me awake. He wasn't having nearly as much trouble as I was. I think I finally passed out around 1:00am (after taking it around 10:00pm). The next morning was funny as hell. I had no recollection of ANYTHING I did the night before. My friend told me everything. The following list is a list of stupid shit I did while on Dimenhydrinate.

- I was laying on that spoke that goes on your toilet paper holder.
- I found my bed sheets all balled up and thrown in the trashcan.
- I went into the bathroom to put my contacts in (I don't remember taking them out) and found one contact in the case and one hard as a rock laying on the bathroom counter and the cap to the left side of my contact case was gone (I found it literally 2 months later, under my bed.).

According to my friend: in the middle of the night I woke up, put my jacket on, walked over to my bedroom door and said, 'It's time to leave.', stood there for about five minutes then got back in bed.

The next time I did it (600 mg) I was hoping for some hallucinations. I however had a 'worse trip'. All I know (according to my friends) I passed out three times that night. Then I woke up staring at my friend's basement door (I don't know how I got there), walked over to the couch I was lying on and saw my friend's boots laying there I picked them up. THEY WEIGHED LIKE 10 POUNDS! I looked up in shock to find my friend lying there with his feet inside his boots. I went back to the door then did the boot thing a second time!

I know this may be a little hard to swallow for some people. But I swear every word of it is true. If you knew me you know I wouldn't lie about something that pointless. I only lie to save my ass.
