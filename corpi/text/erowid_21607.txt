I went to a 'friends' house (J) to make a delivery with my weed-dealer(L) and J had gotten hold of some random pills (Egyptian Eye stamps on the pills). I was offered some and, stupidly, bought 2. chewed one and, unimpressed by the taste, decided to double drop. Drove around with L and J for half an hour or so then just as threshold effects started, returned to my house and listened to music(T+ 0.5 hours). 

L left and J and I sat and smoked a little weed. Suddenly everything in my vision had these 'anti-halos' around them (as though they were radiating darkness, if that makes sense). The world felt evil in a non threatening kind of way. Now, I attribute a colour (or colours) to all my drug experiences (MDMA - bright, happy yellow, MDA - harsh white, 2CB - rainbow colours, Mushrooms - rich, wholesome brown, etc) PMA struck me as an ugly matt black with slight tones of grey. 
 
At T+ 1 hour I became transfixed with getting to this mental state I knew existed and spent a good 45 minutes sitting on the couch trying to get to that state concentrating on the 'high'. Extremely suddenly, the room closed in on me and I started hallucinating in an absolutely evil but strangely comforting way. The memories become a little blurry here and all I can remember is slowly coming back to reality and winding the night up. PMA is the sole reason I now test my pills.
