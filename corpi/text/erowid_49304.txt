[Erowid Note: This incident is described in <a href='http://www.erowid.org/ask/ask.php?ID=3107'>Ask Erowid question #3107.]

My son died from drinking an overdose of poppy seed tea. Poppy seed tea contains morphine in small quantities, which varies greatly in concentration from one batch of seeds to another. My son, 17 yrs old, made tea from 4 lbs of poppy seeds using the standard 'recipe' of hot water and lemon juice. It resulted in his death.

The coroner's blood analysis, urine analysis and cause of death are part of the autopsy report that we show in our Web site. There is important and valuable information there that can help poppy seed tea users to be more educated in the matter. The URL is:
