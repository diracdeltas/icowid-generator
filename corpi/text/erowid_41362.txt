So, this morning I took one Darvocet but knew that wouldn't be suffice, so I added one 10 mg. Valium to that as well as one 200 mgs. Caffeine pill, and an 800 mgs. Motrin, not to mention another cup or two of coffee.

I wasn't getting the sensation I had expected, so I took two shots of DMX, poured myself another cup of coffee and then popped another 200 mgs. Caffeine pill and I finally broke a sweat with a wee bit of dizziness. The dizziness didn't help the cocktail of DMX syrup, the exploding APAP from the Darvocet, or the swishing of the Caffeine x 4, so I plopped on my bed and ended up passing out.

About one hour later I woke up feeling really hot and that's when I popped a 25 mg. Atarax, which is just a fancy pharmaceutical name for a higher strength of Benadryl. The affect of all these different drugs put me in a state of comfort as well as being 'stuck on stupid', meaning I pretty much had A.D.D. until I got up to get some orange juice and felt like I was a walking skeleton. My arms and legs were heavy and I sloshed back and forth while walking as if I were drunk, but that wasn't enough. Since I'm writing this while this is actually happening, I went on to chew 30 more mgs. of Valium and pop 50 mgs. of Elavil. I have just one more to take and then I'll be set.

Anyway, the only downside to this entire experiment was feeling a bit nauseated after taking the DMX. Other than that, right now I feel so damn comfortable I should be looked at as a bathed sloth.
