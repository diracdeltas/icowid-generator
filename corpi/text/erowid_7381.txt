Recently, I had my first experience with shrooms.  I won't elaborate on the trip (beyond saying that it was absolutely incredible, enlightening, and astonishingly dazzling) - because I want to share with everyone the preparation that we consumed - Magic Hot Chocolate!

Firstly, start off by setting to boil enough water for a cup for each tripper. Wash your shrooms to get the dirt off, then once the water has come to a boil, chuck in enough of them for everyone.  Turn down the heat, let cook for about 10-15 mins.

Strain the liquid through a cloth into a jug, and you can then discard or re-boil the shrooms again to get every last bit out of them.

Now mix together some cocoa, sugar & honey to taste in a seperate cup, add a little water and stick it in the microwave until it almost boils over, mix, add to the mushie-jooce, stir well, and serve!

The drink should keep well and tastes nothing of mushrooms, just delicious chocolate - which is really nice when you have some more during your trip :)

Enjoy!
