It deserve to be closely described with its effects, side-effects, doses, rout of administration etc. The most important thing regard Tramadol (Tramal (Germany), Ultram (USA), Mabron (France), Trodon (Bosnia and Herzegovina where I am writing from) and many other brand names. 

My first contact with T was when I have had working at ICU as medical technician. At that time I took only 2 caps (100mg) and did not feel any sensations/effects. I knew it is opioid painkiller, so I was a bit afraid to take some more doses and I quit using it. At that time I have had approach to other medications/drugs like Dolantin (Petidin), Fentanyl, Rohypnol, Talwin (Pentazocin), Ketamin etc. so I used 'em from time to time caring not do reach the hook. After a year, when I was in the army, working also as med. tech., I had terrible headache due to sinusitis so I took 4 pills. After approximatly 25 min I have feel blessness, no-worry-feeling, pain was gone away, and I have feel some speed in my head, and strenghth in my body with warmness trought whole body. Next day I have repeated it but with 5 caps (250mg) and it was amazinly peaceful feeling, with willness to discuss with anyone, about anything. Few times I combine it with alkochol, but I recomend not to drink a lot of alchohol (nausea and/or vomiting).
