Well, this was my boyfriend, nearly scared us all half to death. We split a half between 4 of us and had a little over a gram left and he decided it would be a clever idea to smoke the rest...he packed up the gravity and took a hit...he was seeing really bright neon colors when he followed me into the bathroom and seemed okay to me when he waled out to get me water...then he got dizzy and said i think im going to pass out...he fell to the ground not 2 seconds later ad all the color in his face was gone.. his eyes were open but he wasnt there..we placed him on the couch and after about 3 minutes later his eyes came back.. well he came back.. but it was almsot robotic the way his eyes did. It took about 20 minutes for his color to come back, but he scared all of us pleanty, we thought he was dead..so all in all, my suggestion... dont some em =) eat em =)
