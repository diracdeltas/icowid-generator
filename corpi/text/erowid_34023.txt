I've purchased 500mg of quality 2C-d.

11:00am began dose of 50 mg, I measured out the dose and poured it into some doctor pepper. The substance had a chemical taste but not very bad at all (unlike a tryptamines).

This was my first phenylethylamine so I was full of anticipation and excitment. What people have told me about this drug is that it is very visual with little to no euphoria and it made you engage in conversation more.

11:30am I have chills and a strange warm feeling. a small ache in my back has been magnified.

12:00pm Whoah I've become alert and euphoric! the kind of alertness I associate with my experiences with LSA. But colors a brighter and I notice them more. I also notice how 'green' shadows appear and how red my white dog is. also I notice different colors in plant life and even shades of red and blue in green grass... this effect shifts and the red becomes yellow then green.. sort of like the horses from the wizard of oz

12:30-4p This is when the high REALLY began and continued until the comedown started. I find joy is so many activities especially listening to music is WONDERFUL! The shifting of colors visuals occurs more intensely and at a higher 'frequency'. I also notice the lines on a television broadcast that are normally not visible to the human eye. Euphoria is almost intolerable, closed eye visuals are indescribably beautiful. I also felt in this time compassion for everyone and enhanced cognitive and conversational abilities (even though there was no one around to talk to), on top of the euphoria that was all just lovely. I also need to mention that there was a body high similar to LSA and I had a very high threshhold for pain. It felt so nice to rub my skin against things.

4pm-5pm Come down effects slowly diminish one by one.

5++ after effects last the night, they were like a calm stoney feeling, like fullfilment, the same feeling I get after a Salvia trip.
