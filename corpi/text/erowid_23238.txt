Yes, Niacin is a B vitamin (B3) that dilates capillaries and improves breakdown of sugar within the blood.  Unfortunately, if one takes Niacin before one decides to 'trip', the effect of the acid will be decreased significantly (in my many experiences).  I take Niacin on a regular basis, along with other supplements in conjunction with my diet and workout routine.  When I decide on a day that I'll be taking acid, I try to make sure that I don't take Niacin that day or my 'trip' is significantly reduced.
