After reading a bunch of FAQs about Yohimbe and seeing it mentioned in books, we decided to try it out.  The alleged effects of Yohimbe (the inner bark from a west-african tree) were reported to be: stimulant, euphoriant, warm pleasant spinal shivers, mild perceptual changes, aphrodisiac.

I tried the Yohimbe three times, twice by consuming the yohimbe directly and and the third time trying a tea. I tried 3 different dosages, the recommended dosage, slightly more than recommended dosage, and approximately twice the recommended dosage.  

The effects at all dosages were approximately the same, although at twice the recommended dose they were slightly more pronounced.  The effects were all very subtle, not nearly what I expected them to be.  The most profound effect was a heavy caffeine-like stimulation, complete with stomach cramps.  There was a period where it seemed a little difficult to concentrate, much like if you drink a too much coffee for a long period of time and exhaust your body's supply of L-phenyalanine.  There also was some slight dizziness. We got an awful case of cotton mouth and appeared to become dehydrated.  This dried out my contact lenses and created 'mild perceptual changes'.  For awhile I thought I might be experiencing 'warm spinal shivers' but I think it was more like a bad case of caffeine shakes.  As far as other effects, such as the aphrodisiac qualities, none was noted.  

One effect which might be useful to some people (although I don't know why) was that after taking Yohimbe the first time and feeling disappointed with our experience, we attempted to catch an alcohol buzz but couldn't.  Either we were overstimulated and the alcohol would not depress the CNS or the euphoric effects of alcohol were somehow blocked. 

All in all, I would recommend saving your money.  The effects we experienced from Yohimbe was approximately the same as consuming large amounts of coffee.
