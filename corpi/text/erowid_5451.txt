Just a quick note, the military DOES test for LSD in its piss tests, every time.  However, for some reason it is very hard to pop for it if you are on it.  There was an incident a few months ago were 7 marines(they were still tripping, and took large doses) were tested on the spot after someone got out of hand, only one of the popped positve.  On the flip side, I've know two people who popped positive a day and a half after taking it.
