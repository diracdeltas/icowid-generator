During the first month of 2005, I ran into an over-the-counter medicine known as melatonin.  I was surprised to see it listed as a 'smart drug'.  I read up to find it's many uses for sleep disorders, etc. 

When I first took it [3-4 MG], I was quite surprised of the feeling I awoke with.  It gives the ability to put me to sleep much easier than I normally can and seems to create a deeper sleep in the process.  I find myself waking up in a 6 or 7 hour time range rather than 9 to 10 and still feeling very awake.  

I noticed its calming effect on dreams.  It seems to give me a very smooth dream that deals with many personal issues and settles them out, making me contain a much more up-beat attitude and greater perspective on life the following day.  Several articles and reports have claimed on possible headaches of sorts, but in my month of taking, I have never experienced such a thing.  

And though I try not to make this seem like such an effective drug, it truly is if I'm looking for something to smooth out some sleeping issues and wish for a good mood the next day.
