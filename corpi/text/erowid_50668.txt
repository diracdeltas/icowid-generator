I thoroughly mixed 3 grams of standardized 25x Blue Lotus powder in a small tea cup of homemade red wine at about 11pm. Over the course of the night I experience nothing more than hot flashes as if I were mildly sick with a fever. This is my first experience with Blue Lotus and I was very dissapointed.
