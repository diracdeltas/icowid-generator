I smoked some Wild Dagga leaves about an hour ago and it definitely worked, and thus I am happy with the effects. It is very much comparable to marijuana in the variety of effects it produces, but the effects in themselves are entirely unique in their own way. 

I noticed that for about 15-20 minutes after I toked I had a pretty strong MJ-like buzz; euphoria, slight pleasant pressure in the forehead and temple region (what I like to call the 'head high'), slight body buzz, heightened sensory perception (to things like music and movement) and a significant change in temporal perception. (The 10 minutes after I smoked seemed to last much much longer, it was nice!) This stuff is less lethargic and more stimulating than pot and a much shorter-lived high. I'd say the obvious effects of the high last to about 40-60 minutes with subtle after effects continuing. No burn-out! just a gradual decline.

I then drove to get some grub, but I strongly recommend not driving under the influence of this stuff. (the place was just a few blocks away) The whole trip lasted about 10-15 minutes but it seemed much longer and more enjoyable.

I rolled it into cigarettes. Bongs might work well too. I've tried smoking it from a pipe but it wasn't nearly as successful.
