a couple weeks ago i went outto a tree farm near my house and picked three bags full of the yellow-orange flys. i took the caps off of them and placed them in my dehydrator for a couple hours.  i have done this drug plenty of times before- (ex. 1.eating them raw 15 caps, 2.making soup w/10 caps, 3. raw caps mixed w/ pasta w/ 15caps) just to name a few but without smoking some weed with them they make me feel really nauseas. so 2 nights ago i made some more mushroom soup w/10 caps and waited 'til i got really nauseas then took 2 hits off of my pipe and was good to go, minutes later i got a sudden wave of thoughts my vision was going in and out and everything seemed to move in slow-mo and in waves. lasted a couple hours but i really didnt note anything about it except it really was cool. 
none of my experiences compares to my journey last night.

i was really bored throughout the day and the night came pretty fast and with nothing else to do and no pot or beer to drink i decided i should go and eat a couple caps from my collection of amanitas. but i hesitated because i didnt want to get nauseas with no weed to smoke.... but i was bored so i said fuck it.
i took 8 medium sized caps and ate them by themselves with only some iced tea  to wash them down, but i dont mind the taste of mushrooms so it went down easy. 
----Time 12:20a.m- 8 medium caps dried taken orally
----Time 1:15a.m-- began to feel nauseas but held it down by resting and breathing
----Time 1:35a.m-- nausea gone but not for good, began seeing things flash and wavelike motions. trip began.

so the trip began.....
i threw wood on my fireplace and layed down on my couch an turned on some bob dylan and relaxed. only minutes later when i opened my eyes i thought i was floating to the top of my ceiling and above my fireplace , i could actually see myself getting higher and higher it felt like in dreams when you fly, it was great, but then a noise brought me back down to the couch and my light began zipping down to the other end of my wall and then back, i stared at the flames and could actually see what the fire did, how it worked to throw the smoke and sparks up my chimney---wow! i thought what the fuck am i thinking? and then just like that i could see myself from the fireplace staring at the flames as they chewed slowly through the wood. this was an experience.

next i ventured to my kitchen to get a drink when everything seemed to elevate and it felt i was walking on air. it felt great and my mind was open for anything now...but the nausea came back and i had to puke. so i went outside and threw my fucking guts up, came in drank some tea and layed back down and began to elevate to the top of my fireplace and to my ceiling, with every inhalation i was forced higher and every exhalation i was pushed down, so i held my breath and went up, exhaled went down, looked at the top of my fire place and every breath i inhaled i was drawn closer and exhaled went backwards so pretty soon my fireplace was going forward backward forward backward in and out, and nearly every object i looked at had a distorted figure. it was awesome this went on until about 5:30a.m when i passed out.

these yellow-orange amanitas are one of the coolest natural drugs. these are not like lsd or psilocybin but last night gave me a reson why these mushrooms were held sacred for thousands of years. last night was by far my best amanita trip yet.

i'm very experienced when it comes to drugs and you maybe too, but don't get reckless with them.
