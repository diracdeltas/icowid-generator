My doctor recently prescribed Olanzapine (Zyprexa) 5mg for a anxiety problem. I took two the night I picked the prescription up. I ate dinner and took a seat on the couch. 

As I am a heavy marijuana user, I smoked my usual few bowls of the evening. After about 30 minutes of smoking the second bowl I noticed a 'heavily stoned' feeling. It really brought me back to the time when I smoked my first joint, I was completely blazed. I can usualy smoke 3 or 4 bowls before I get pretty stoned but this was a whole different level. I continued to take the pills as prescribed and smoking a hour or so later for the duration of the prescription. I highly recomend smoking and taking this. 

I tried mixing this with Alcohol - No Effect

Other than helping me get really stoned this drug did nothing for me but give me migranes from the time that I woke in the morning till about 2 pm. I recomend this as a short term recreational drug as my experiences were extremely pleasant.
