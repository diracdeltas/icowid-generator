In need of guidance on a particular life issue, I decided to smoke some Salvia.  I used to trip in the 60's, but have used meditation since then.  I was out in the woods at night with my two dogs.  I took one toke and the woods around me appeared somewhat strange.  I took another toke and I felt like I was being drawn into another reality.  The dirt bank across the stream appeared three dimensional, like the entrance to a temple.  One of my dogs started to bark as if someone was present.  I felt the presence too.

Not being prepared to enter another dimension, I began to sing my mantras to keep me anchored.  The notes flowed together flawlessly.  I called a protector, an avatar, Babaji. The space filled with another kind of energy, and my other dog started to bark.  Then the vision went away.  

Back at home I meditated in my back yard near my Datura Metel plant.  A beautiful goddness appeared in place of the plant.  She was exquisitely lovely with silver hair made of moonbeams- I thought it might be Datura, but then I understood that it was Salvia showing me that Datura can take many forms.

I had second thoughts about how many guardians I actually wanted, but felt that the potential of Salvia outweighs the risks.
