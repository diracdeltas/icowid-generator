Some friends and I used to get together with a few packs of whipit bottles and a cracker, fill up a few balloons and suck it down. It's always the same kinds of affects, your vision seems to close in, you lose motor skills (which generally means that if your standing, you fall over really retardedly), all sounds are distorted, parts of your body pulsate and we used to laugh heaps. Sometimes I'd just roll around on the floor laughing histerically, then come out of it and it'd be weird picking myself off the ground sober.

Nothing adverse happened to us, except for when a friend tried to run just after taking a balloon, he fell over and hurt himself pretty bad. Only after affects we noticed was a weird tasting mouth, your muscles being a bit sluggish for 1/2 an hour and sometimes my face would feel a bit numb and fuzzy.<!--I'd highly recommend Nos for anyone looking for something a bit different.-->
