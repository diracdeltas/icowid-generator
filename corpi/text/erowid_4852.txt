At around the time I started smoking weed on a regular basis I also starting smoking alone at home. I would always buy weed from the same person and a couple of time it was laced with coke and that was fine because it just made it better. I probably should have realized that maybe this guy wasn't so reliable considering I didn't ask for coke. 

I was home alone and had nothing to do. I hated being bored and I knew that if I were high I wouldn't be bored anymore so I decided to smoke a little reefer. I got out my friend's bowl that I borrowed because I didn't know how to roll blunts yet (and blunts were all I smoked). I didn't smoke much before I started to feel different than I normally feel when I was high. Something was definitely different. I just figured it was different weed or it was the coke weed again because something was definitely not right. I hadn't tripped before so I didn't know I was tripping. 

I went downstairs and made a sandwich. I took a stool from the dining room and brought it into the kitchen. I pulled it up to the counter and ate there. I couldn't stop thinking about the fact that I was eating at the counter. It seemed so strange. But was it really? I didn't know. I tried to think about something else, anything else, but I couldn't. Why was I eating at the counter? If someone saw me would they think like I was? Would they know how weird it was? Would they think that people that didn't eat at tables were crazy? Was I crazy? Something was clearly wrong. 

I went back to my room still thinking about where I ate. I was thinking all about it. Was it really bothering me? I guess I had felt like this for about a hour when it got even harder. I stopped being able to put things together. Sentences didn't make sense because they were more than one word. I understood what was going on and I didn't at the same time. Reality was incomprehensible but I knew what was happening. It was so unexplainable. I realized that I couldn't put two things together so I tried to concentrate and get my thoughts straight. I would say to myself, "Ok, the bed is here and I'm sitting on the bed." I didn't make sense. I could only comprehend myself or the bed alone, not together. I tried a few other examples in my head but nothing worked. Comprehension was SO confusing. I started to get really frustrated. I crawled into a ball on my bed hitting my hands on my head (not hard) trying to think straight. It was so annoying. Then I started to think if this was reality. Did I normally think like this? Was I imagining that something was different? No, something was definitely different.  

I stated to think what if I never went back to normal. What if things stayed like this? I was convinced they would. I didn't know what to do. I had to stop thinking about it. I thought I'd go insane if I didn't stop. I walked to a friend's house. I was supposed to meet him around this time. On the walk there I just thought about what was going on. When I got about a block from his house I started to smile. I was happy for not apparent reason even though I was having a bad time. I told him and my friend who was already there that I think the weed I smoked was laced with something. They could tell by the way I was acting that something was up. 

They tried to be stupid and tell me things that weren't true to see my reaction. I knew what was going on. I told them I'm aware of what they're doing. They never tripped before so they didn't know what it was like. They just figured I was in an idiotic, gullible state. Reality was completely different but I could tell what was real and what wasn't. I noticed there was something about my friend. I figured it out. He was a superhero. I knew it was ridiculous and untrue, but there seemed to be truth behind it. I couldn't put my finger on it. There was something there that made him a superhero. I knew it wasn't true and I knew it was at the same time. It was so crazy. I told him I knew. I told him I was aware that he was a superhero. I knew it would sound so stupid but I had to tell him. Since I couldn't put my finger on what it was that made him a superhero I asked him what his power was. There had to be some truth behind this ridiculousness. 

Since he wasn't tripping I really couldn't have a conversation with him. He starting telling me obvious lies again. I told him I knew when he was lying and telling the truth but it didn't phase him. I started to get pissed off. It was really annoying trying to talk with them. They just didn't get it. 

We started to walk to the movie theatre to meet people and do something. I think I fell a few times on the way there, I really don't remember. When we got there I went to talk to my other friend who worked at the concession stand. He was pissing me off too. He reached at me and I fell on my ass. It was kind of funny. When I got up he reached at my head again and I thought he was trying to pull my hair out so I started to swing at him. He was being such an asshole. I wanted to hit him. I clearly made a scene so I had to leave. We went into town and the craziness eventually diminished. What an insane experience. It was so frustrating I hated it. There was nothing fun about it. I'm pretty sure it was PCP. I've tripped on other drugs since then and enjoyed it but this first time sucked. I wouldn't do it again because there was nothing good about it. Nothing at all.
