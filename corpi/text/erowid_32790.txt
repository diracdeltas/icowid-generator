The whole life changing experience started when my older brother came down form college for a week break. He had brought some psilocybin  mushrooms down from the beautiful Colorado mountains.  My brother having tried these many time knew it would be a wounderful experiance for me so he decided to give me some for free. It had been snowing for about three days and we got 43 inches of snow when it finally stopped snowing that moonlit night. That night I decided to eat them and go explore the new white world outside my door. I had ate them inside my house and waited 30 minutes and put on my snow gear. 

The second I stepped out side I new I was in for a great trip. About twenty minutes later I knew there was no turning back and it had already begun. The first thing I noticed it  appeared almost like it was day and the sun was in full flare this was probably caused from the moon reflecting off the snow, of course the mushrooms played a huge part in this. Another thing a noticed was I could not stop laughing as the tall trees above me, there was a slight breeze that night which made them sway back and forth but to me it looked liked they were floppy sea weed in the night sky.  Some snow had got in my eye's when watching this happend so i closed my eyes. This is when I discovered closed eye visuals, I had no idea I could see so many colors and patters by closing my eyes, this is just unexplainable and my favorite effect of mushrooms. I had no idea how much time I have been out there maybe it was hourse or just a few minutes but I never wanted this to end.
