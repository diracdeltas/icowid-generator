I first became interested in this stuff because i believe myself to be ADD. My mom refused to allow me to get a script, but i found a friend with a good supply. First time i took it (20mg), i felt an increased energy, ability to study, concentrate, etc.  It is exactly what i needed to give me the motivation to do boring tasks like school work. Ive used ritalin many many times. My highest doses have been between 110mg orally and 80mg insuffilated. Low doses for school, high for a feeling comparable to coke. 
I feel as though now im beginning to become addicted. I will do a couple (or four) and when i think i am coming down a couple more.  When my friends see me high off of it they say i look calm but excited inside(very true, but more than excited inside, exstatic insides the word). Ive tried many drugs (coke, X, weed, pills), but Ritalin the only one i actually crave. Be careful with this stuff, i take breaks in my use to give my body a rest, it will eat you up. I was actually accused of being a coke head because my face is getting leaner.
