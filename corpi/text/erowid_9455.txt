After spending a great deal of my adolescence avoiding drugs (my mother died of the consequences of a cocaine addiction), a male friend coaxed me into trying nitrous oxide.  It was enjoyable the first two times, but the most pleasurable experience was on my own.

I went to the head shop my dad gets his marijuana paraphernalia from and discovered that they did indeed sell whippets.  As for the cracker and balloons, I made do with an old plastic model and Zip-loc bags.

Lying on my bed in a nearly dark room, I cracked open the first one into a bag.  

In my experience, nitrous oxide is best done when one inhales and exhales deeply, then quickly inhales the contents of the balloon or bag.  Without releasing any, I breathe in as much air as I can to 'cap' the nitrous.  

The disadvantage of nitrous oxide is that the high is short, and fleeting.  But oh, the high...

It's something that comes to you so quickly and yet so gradually.  It's the blue auroral flash of nitrous that ignites itself in the air, seemingly, even when you close your eyes.  And you will close your eyes.  

The nitrous is a blue dragon that carries you upwards through the vastness of space, above an electrical storm humming below and all around you.  The storm rises with you, and your extremities tingle.  There is exhilaration, and then urgency.  It's like being carried to the edge of consciousness to look at the bright stars just beyond our grasp.

The nitrous drops you fairly quickly.  I find the experience is a very pleasant one.  So I did eleven more whippets.  This gave me a bad gas stomach ache, but I'm not complaining.
