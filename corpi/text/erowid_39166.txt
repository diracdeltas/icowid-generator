I found harmaline to be the most visually hallucinogenic substances that I've ever experienced. I took it in the evening and walked and stumbled into a dark part of the old growth forest. Once there I was confronted by megalolithic Amazonian Indian figures who seemed to know me. These were the most solid, well defined, colorful visions I have ever seen. They were real. Initially, I did see some 'beautiful women' images which were slightly transparent and bluish.

At its peak, I was born into the air and transported into a full blown Amazonian ceremony where I was surrounded by dancing fluit playing Indians in primitive regalia. I was aware that I was at the center of an extremely important right of passage. At the hight of the ceremony I was raised high into the air and entered the cavity of my body as if I were a bird flying into a cave.

I really loved the stuff but my buddy that I took it with spent most of the time writhing around as if he was stuggling with reality. I don't think I want to take it again but I would really like to take Yage vine which I've yet to try.
