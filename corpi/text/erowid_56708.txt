Prior in the day to this experience i wondered about the effects of combining 2cb(snorted) and ketamine and thought best to stay away or at least do some research first. unfortunatley the internet was not accessible, and now finding out there are no reports included on this combination i thought i would have to contribte. so here we go...

9.00pm - i measure out two 23mg hits of 2cb for me and friend A. Friend B then weighs out two 25mg hits for himself and friend C. we eat them up rapidly at this time.

we head off to a techno club about 10 or so and by 10.30 am begining to feel the effects. A doesnt seem to be feeling half as high as me (he hasnt taken the substance before so may not recognise its onset) and for B things seem to be rising fast.

11.30? we decide to intensify the already enjoyable and trippy high by snorting some K. im  not tosure how much the others took but i had a rather fat coin and within minutes was begining to feel the familiar onset of K. but in the beautiful 2cb colours. C doesnt take any K for now. but B PROBABLY snorted more than me and A who has never had K before either PROBABLY had less.

for the next half an hour i was lost in  a lovely world quite unable to stand but thouroughly enjoying it all. we leave the club and head to another place to see some friends - by now (2am?) the K is well gone but am still high from 2cb. We leave the next venue about 3am and head back to B and Cs home. 

On arrival we all inhale 10mg of 2cb and a good line of K about 2 mins later(by now 3.20am or so). 10 mins later we are all incredibly ruined . the visuals were phenomenal and we listened to really loud hard techno for a while whilst generally laughing around and getting lost in our selves. my sense of time totally went by this point and im unsure of times exactly from this point.

as we started to come down from the previous lines - roughly 5am? - but still incredibly tripped out i proceed to round 2

B requests a line of solely K so i rack him one up that was quite large but we had quite a disagreement about heavy it would be - with me stupidly sayin i would of snorted 2x the amount on a sober head and then B tryin to make me do just that - to no avail. but feeling that 2cb is much more appropriate to be doing i put a sly 3mg into his line.  A and C both get a smaller line of K with about 3-4mg of 2cb in as well.

I decide on 10mg and a smallish amount of K - not enough to normally get me into its digital domain.

within a minute of snorting this line im in another world - i remember the room was constantly changing it took on an infinite number of variations throughout the experience. B started playing a Johnny Cash tune and was messing with it somehow using a computer( i still dont know how he did it) and it started to sound like psychedelic folk or rock then it started to sound like reggae then like minimal techno (i was convinced it was different songs) then the whole thing climaxed in a high pitched wooooooooooooooop sound that i was completely attached to - when it ended i was incredibly disappointed. then when asked B told us that the whole thing had been Cash, the other 3 of us were amazed. 

some time after snorting the line (15 mins i recon) the K began to take a hold. i felt as if i was gonna lose it. NB i have never k-holed despite countless experiences on K although ive come close before. - i got a weird sort of tunnel vision where the whole room was compressed into an incredibly small space but was still incredibly 2cb orientated. i remember waving as i thought i was gonna go and seeing incredibly intense tracers. 

a few minutes later i realised i would stay with it but i was in a completely new head space - the room (visually) was a complete mix of the two drugs. it felt like a cross roads and very similar to what i experience with salvia divinorum - although i often find K and salvia have similarities - but 2cb provided the colours that salvia often does(in my minds eye)

one of the most profound hallucinations i rememeber having was a green shape in the middle of the room sucking everything into it - it was like the centre of existence and it felt very close to me. (throughout the whole night incredible visuals were happening but most of them i cant remember now but this was the one that seemed most important)

im not sure how long this second dose of lines had me but it was daylight by the time i was starting to come down. at this point B  tries to get me to do more K but it still has enough of a hold for me to know it would be a stupid idea . A and B have some more K and we just sit around laughing and smoking bud for the rest of the morning - falling asleep about 10am , although i only got back to baseline about 9am.

The whole night was incredible -one of the best drug experiences ive had and one i would do again altho i would suggest that 2cb potentiates the ketamine as it was getting me a lot more than it would normally of - i did have a high tolerance to the stuff about 1 month prior to this experience but hadnt used it since then as i was using it most days in the week and wasnt really enjoying it - i feel like it is a creepy drug as in the sense i can feel it kind of looking over my shoulder in a sinister way. this did happen during this experience but the 2cb made it more tolerable. i would be happy if i never took ketamine on its own again but i would definetly take it with 2cb again - luckily i have a nice supply of both for the moment. 

alot of the night i cant remember but aside the effects of ketamines far out world the trip wasnt to heavy on the mind - unlike say acid or mushrooms. which i feel makes 2cb a great party drug or one I can take to boost my mood - unlike acid or shrooms. the lack of personal insight was a bit of a disappointment but i think this is probably a good thing as it makes it much more likely my trip will go safely - i think it would be hard to have a really bad trip on 2cb unless I really over did it.

anyway sorry about the sloppyness of this report my memories of the night are very hazy, but i can say that a combination of snorting ketamine with 2cb is thouroughly enjoyable but i would go easy on the K as it seems alot more potent when combing and isnt (again personally) as enjoyable as 2cb.

All in all this was one of the most psychedelic experiences i have ever had(but as mentioned without the ego dissolution and room for fear) and i will definetly do these two drugs in combination again but would probably increase the amount of 2cb and stay with a similar amount of K. 

cheers and i hope this helps the curious
