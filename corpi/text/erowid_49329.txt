After reading about Absinthe on the internet I was highly curious.  I shelled out more than $100 to get a bottled shipped here to the USA.  I am not wealthy, just extremely curious.  Let me tell you my one mistake:  I bought Parisian and not Bohemian Absinthe. The difference is that Parisian is flavored with Anise seed.  I had no idea what anise seed was until I drank it.  Turns out that anise is what gives black licorice its flavor.  I can eat or drink damn near anything BUT black licorice!  YUK!

Anyways afetr 4 or 5 double shots of this stuff mixed with spring water and a sugar cube I was gagging but, not really high.  I was fairly drunk feeling though and I had a 6-pak of beer or more each of the two times I drank it.

What I DID get out of Absinthe both times was fascinating.  My dreams when I crashed were extremely real.  To give you an idea of how real let me explain something.  I have an intense imagination, I remember virtually all of my dreams, and usually I know when I am dreaming and have even controlled them many a time.  I have also successfully created lucid dreams on several occasion.  During these Absinthe induced dreams I knew I was dreaming.  It was almost like an experiment as I touched wallpaper and bathroom towels noticing how real they felt.  It was amazing!  The second time I was kissing a girl I had known in school and it was so incredibly real I felt as though I had been unfaithful to my wife.  I don't know if this will happen for everyone dreaming but, for me it was incredible.  <!--*Keep in mind that 4-5 double shots combined with 6-8 beers is a lot of alcohol so use caution if you aren't good at handling liquor.-->
