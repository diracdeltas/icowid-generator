<!--Just wanted to write a quick note to the people who have posted their addictive experiences with amphetamines. -->I hadnt done any kind of 'speed' except cocaine when I first tried extasy at a 'roll bar'. After that I couldnt get enough, spending up to $200 a night on the lil bastards. 

A couple years later x started to phase out in the scene I was in to be replaced by somethin called 'Tina' which was a cover up for methamphetamine. Loved it and began a cycle of abuse for the next 6 years. After finally kicking the shit for good 2 years ago I met a new friend at a new job about a year ago who happened to have ADD and took adderall. I knew about adderall and knew it was an aphetamine and gladly took her up on her offer. We are now very good friends and she seems to be all about sharing her medication. 

Its becoming EXTREMELY difficult to stop taking them and I have gotten about as strung out on her prescription as I was on meth. I'm trying my damndest to stop the cycle and it seems like I'm fighting a losing battle with it. I want to caution anyone who has had past abusive experiences with speed to stay the hell away from Adderall or other such ADD medications. Although in my experience nothing gives the euphoria like adderall.
