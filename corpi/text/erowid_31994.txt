Well it was the middle of the night and I could not sleep. Now typicaly when I cant sleep, I think about getting high. I have used gravol in the past many times. It always turns out to be an all nighter. So what better way to spend a sleepless night? I went to the 24 hour pharmacy and grabbed a pack. Now where I live gravol is kept behind the counter. This makes it difficult to purchese because it always ends up being a conversation with the pharmacist. Anyway I put on my best motion sick face and got my pack.
   
I took them at home in case I got delayed. Driving well trippin on this is a bad idea. 40 min after swallowing my meds I was having my first sensations. I know when the trip is coming because my feet start to tingle. After the foot sensations come the clinched jaw. Then all hell broke lose. The floor was moving, my mind was racing, and paranoia took over. I was scared, I am not sure of what, but it freaked me out. I began sweating, and was cold at the same time. 

I ended up tripping till about 9am and got to bed about 10:30am. <!--I recomend this drug to anyone looking to have -->Deep and profound realizations about myself and everything around me.
