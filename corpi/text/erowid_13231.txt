It was my first day home from my hippie filled Quaker school in New Hampshire where the 35 kids do drugs constantly for Christmas vacation. I was somewhat depressed beacuse of my lack of weed, and so I did what I always do in that situation. I procured some DXM. After acquiring a bottle of Delsym from my local CVS I smoked some salvia on the way home. I had copious amounts of the unextracted stuff. With salvia alone, the effects were at times amazing, and at times barely noticible. I had robosaled before, but not by myself.

Anyway, later that night, after my parents had gone to sleep and I had the house to my self, I drank the Delsym. I had thoughts of later playing this rollercoasting construction game (wicked trippped out) with NIN as background music, great fodder for a robotrip. Unfortunately, after about 1 and a half hours after I took the DXM I could bareley notice the effects. I attributed this to the fact that I had just robotripped 2 days earlier, and I do build up a tolerance, and not to the rumor that Delsym doesn't work, being that I have successfully tripped off it many times in the past.

At that point, I had become Roboangry. My mind had the disassocaited numbness of a DXM trip, but none of the amazing and insightful thoughts and euphoria. So, I decided to go out on my back porch and smoke some sal to make myself lose the capibility to comprehend dissappointment. I packed about a gram of unadulterated salvia into my resin caked bowl and proceeded to take 5-6 monsterous hits, becoming more and more fascinatingly disassociated after each one.

On maybe the 5th hit, I encountered my muse: Mr. Sal. I always close my eyes when smoking Salvia to enjoy a more introspective and mystical experience, and usually am lost in it but somewhere in my brain I know of the perplexing ingredient known as reality. This time however, I was (no lie) transported to a very high scale, mid 18th-century resurant at a table with figures resembling the famous composers of that period, Beethoven, Motzart, and Bach. That was the lower right hand side of my hallucination. The rest of my mental landscape was engulfed in a vibrant, looming darkness I can only describe as Mr. Sal. I heard the name over and over again beckoning me.

This scared the living bejeezzus out of me so I got up, ran inside, and started playing that game to relive my fears. At this point I was terribly fucked up. I went on playing the game for maybe an hour and a half, experiencing some of the most intensely psychadelic feelings I have ever known. At some point, and I cant really explain this logically, I felt Mr. Sal beckoning to me. I had a terrible and insatiable lust to continue my conversation with this myserious and great individual. I went into my room, turned the lights out, and packed and immense bowl of Salvia into my bowl. I began to hit the bowl feverishly, utterly devoid of any rational human thought, in my attempts to re-encounter Mr. Sal. 

Still possesing a buzz from the previous sal smoking, and a vivid recollection of the events which transpired after doing so, I returned to the same place I was in on my back porch. This time, there was a female presence at the table with the musicians who was somewhat reminisant of your run of the mill reporter. For some reason it stands out in my memory that she was wearing a burgundy coat over a white dress shirt. That is irrelevant. Anyway, this time, like before, after the fifth hit Mr. Sal returned to me.

The next half hour was a cataclysm of the greatness of Mr. Sal. I can remember what seemed like eternities of me praising Mr. Sal and His greatness, and me having one-sided conversations with him. I guess I figured he was god. I had no concept of god at that point, and I think the whole concept of god and the history of religion which I am well educated on became engulfed by the might and power of Mr. Sal and I felt light the holy ghost had eaten me. I wasn't thinking these thoughts at the time, the are my meager attempts to describe what I was feeling. All the while, I was having some sort of benign interactions with the people at the table, though not very vivid or meaningful. I was amazed by thier presence, though.

Anyway, after about half an hour, I went downstairs to get something I felt that I needed (I have no idea what) and continued seeing and feeling and experiencing Mr. Sal in a dreamy type state. I'm mentioning this because at the time I did not feel altered at all, it just seemed natural to me to be talking to and praising Mr. Sal. After that, I went upstairs and went to sleep thinking of this mysterious diety. Ever since that day, I still have flashbacks to the experience in which I feel a great love and admiration for Mr. Sal, even though I logically know he doesn't exist (what the hell is he?!?) and often find myself wondering just what the hell did happen that night? I find it very hard to gain insight into my visions, but I'm sure they must mean SOMETHING. This experience was the most fucked up I have ever been, completeley detached and in a world all my own, more so than a k-hole, dmt, acid, shrooms, or anything. It was amazing. Mr. Sal became my reality, my world.
