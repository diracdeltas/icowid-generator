Myself and two other of my friends had decided to try out coca used insuffalated and it wasn't that bad.

We started to break it up at about 4:00 p.m, and at about 4:20 p.m. we drew out a few lines and insufflated them.

The high was great and lasted for about an hour to thirty mins.  We talked about life and happiness and how drugs are a way to better life and not a way to mess up.

The crash lasted for a good while and had a feeling of just tired and worn out but we rolled a few blunts while crashing and snow capped a few bong hits and it was all good.  Great euphoric high and great feeling of happiness
