Well like the title says and many ppl say....e eventually loses its magic as sad as it is. The first time I tried e, I was pretty much in heaven, talking faster than an auctioneer, I'm serious I was saying like 100 words a minute about Total nonsense, and I feel close and empathetic towards every1 and everything is just Amazing. Everytime I did e after that first time it was good but about 10% weaker than the last time, and now after doing it over 40 times in my lifetime, it feels like shit. Dont get me wrong, I still feel alooot of pleasure, but not 2 much talking and 'closeness' towards ppl, just a really good body buzz and good sensations wen feeling things.

After my e stage, I started getting sick of feeling good for like 2 and a half hours and then being Really depressed later, it was just a wayt to ruin a perfect party/night, so after my e stage, I got into coke. Coke was the same exact thing, started out good, no craving, then after doing it alot I got addicted to it and then it only felt good for 15 mins after every line and the depression and craving would start. After my e and coke stages I just got sick of chemical drugs....now I just drink....alot :)  its honestly the only way to go if I dont wana smoke weed at a party and I actually wana lose control. Fuck all that chemical shit, I'm never doing coke again, probably gona do pure mdma like after not doing e again for like 5 or 6 months.<!--but after all my drug usage, I'm telling u like many ppl will, alcohol is the way to go if u wana have a good time on a weekend, and weed for weekdays. Thank u for giving a fuck about wat I had to say.-->
