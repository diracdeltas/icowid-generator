It's summertime and my sister just graduated from highschool. After a famaly party to celebrate the graduation, we (Myself, cousin A, cousin E, sister C, and two friends of cousin A, Friend C and Friend K) retired to a cozy little shed we called The Lair. I had previously planned to try DMT, but still alas, have not experienced it. Cousin A said that he did have 5-MeO-DMT and I agreed to give that a try, but I wanted to take acid that night as well, and would wait till a still period to smoke the 5-MeO-DMT. Cousin A suggested that I try 5-MeO-DiPT instead as he thought that I may enjoy it. So, he cut up doses for everyone that wanted to try it. To my amazement my sister, sister C, wanted to try 5-MeO-DiPT as well. So, in total, everyone except cousin E took 5-MeO-DiPT. I figure my dose at around 15mg, as I did not know the measurement at the time, the effects were almost exact compared to my ordinary dose of 15mg I take now. 

Within 30 mins, I notice feeling very relaxed with a bizarre body buzz. I had been smoking weed quite a bit, but this felt diffrent. An hour had passed, and I noticed an immediate peak with intense euphoric rushes. I was smiling alot and had never felt happier, but I did notice an increase in heartrate as I have also noticed during other experiences, this increase usually only lasts during the peak and fades within 15-30 mins.  I had to mention this as people with high blood pressure and heartrate, like myself, may be at risk. Although, I have never experienced a medical emergancy during any of my 5-MeO-DiPT experiences, it may be something to keep in mind and be prepared for.

Okay, back to the trip. During this peak, I was so blessed to hear my first taste of the electronic duo, Boards Of Canada. I immediately fell in love with the beutiful sound and melodies of these two and now own most of thier releases.  Sister C reports she is feeling only as if she is stoned. Cousin A acts as dj for the night and is 'Doing Okay'. The same goes for both friends C and K. 

A little later, we decide it is time for the 5-MeO-DMT. I was alittle uneasy about trying it now, the 5-MeO-DiPT had produced a little bit of paranoia and it was holding me back. (song playing: Tha by Aphex Twin) Friend C decided to go first. Upon inhaling the smoke, he handed the pipe to cousin A, and sat back exhaling the smoke. I immediately felt a wierd connection to him and got a wierd buzz as so did everyone else in the room, I later heard. During the first part of his trip, he looked around with a look of curiosity and puzzlement, as if he had never seen these surroundings. I am still experiencing a connection buzz. Then, I noticed that his entire body appeared to be buzzing. He wasn't convulsing, as everything about his physical condition appeared to be normal and he was breathing normally. The wierd connection buzz dissapears. 

Without warning, he slithered off of the couch onto the floor and started doing these intense stretches. Then, he would roll into a new position and stretch again. His stretches were powerful as his arm pressed up against my leg with unhuman pressure. He then, after only 10 mins, got up and looked around the room as if he had just been born again. We asked him if he was alright and he said he was better than ever. He had no memory of the movements. (songs playing: Ageispolis and I by Aphex Twin) 

Cousin A decided to go next as maybe it would calm my paranoia alittle to see him handle it. He took the hit and handed the pipe to me. I once again felt a connection buzz when he blew out the smoke, but this time it went away within seconds. He sat back and smiled without moving an inch. His breathing got slower and more relaxed. He seemed completely relaxed. Then, within 7 mins, he suddenly starting talking to me trying to calm me down enough to take a hit. (song playing: Haunted Indiana by Sandi Beach) I decide to go for it. 

I light the pipe according to careful instructions from cousin A and clear the chamber. I hand him the pipe while still holding the smoke in. The smoke feels very heavy and with almost a plastic like taste. I blow the smoke out and immediately the room breaks into individual tiled patterns. They changed to the exact flowing of the piano in the background. I hear a voice faintly in the background (Sandi starts his vocal) and it seems to paint the landscape before me as the room turned, twisted and morphed itself into entirely new enviroments all to the flowing of the delicate piano lines that were now flowing with my body. Everything suddenly connected. The music and atmosphere were one. My body and the atmosphere were one. My body and the music were one. Everyone in the room was me and I was everybody in the room, and so these connections continued until, for a brief moment, the room reformed, and the high (or complete atmospheric revolution) faded. I had the time to look around the room and become aware of a conversation, then I heard it. Cousin A was talking to Friend K and said 'Imagine if sages (scientists) in the future came up with a machine that could capture a past memory and allow them to re-experience it.' (During this time the song Haunted Indiana is changing key and tempo, going into it's second and final stage.) 

Then, the 5-MeO-DMT decides it is not done with me yet and immediately reforms the oneness, but this time it is diffrent. I become aware that I am experiencing an exact replica of my initial 5-MeO-DMT trip, but this time through the eyes of someone else. I become aware of a large living crystal structure that is somehow responsible for everything being one. I then, discover that this is the machine. It is the futuristic device of my cousin's pondering question. My memory is being re-experienced at that moment and somehow, I am aware of it. The being that was the one experiencing my memory also became aware of my awareness, causing a sort of cosmic, non-verbal, thought based communication across unexisting time. The communication being that of only the feeling of amazement and awe experienced the same between the two of us. Then, the song ended and so did my trip as it quickly faded away with the reverb of the last piano strike 10 mins later. 

I had noticed that friend K was leaving and had just said he'd be back later. Sister C now seems to be fully into her trip and when asked if she wanted to try 5-MeO-DMT, she simply smiled and said 'No, this is good.' Cousin E stayed sober and acted as a sober sitter for the night. We agreed that Friend K would probely take a hit when he came back. So, for an undecided amount of time we talked, laughed, and listened to countless songs over the course of our 5-MeO-DiPT trips. All except for my sister who only smiled and never said much the entire night. We consistently asked her if she was okay just to be on the safe side and she always looked up with a soft smile and said 'Yes, this is good.' 

Friend K came back eventually and decided to hit the 5-MeO-DMT. (Songs Playing- Nanou by Aphex Twin and Turqoise Hexagon Sun by Boards Of Canada) He inhaled the smoke and handed the pipe to cousin A. I felt an immediate connection buzz again, but this time, it is not so pleasent. He immediately jumped off of the couch onto all fours, facing the other couch in which were sitting sister C and cousin E. He growled so horribly and it did not sound at all human, more like a primal animal of huge size proportions. This frightened sister C and cousin E so much, they jumped over the back of the couch. After hearing these growls, I become aware of other sounds he was making. Hisses, grunts, and even cartoon like noises. All of which, still never sounded human. Cousin E, our sober sitter is so frightened she decides to wait outside until his trip was over. Cousin A was focusing mainly on calming friend K down, but nothing got through. Then, Nanou ended and friend K fell back and layed still in a fetal position. The other two songs on the Aphex cd were very harsh, so cousin A switched the tune to Turqoise Hexagon Sun. 

Good move, friend K immediately relaxed, but kept asking 'What's in me?' 'Am I dead?' and one time I heard. 'Who is in me?' Then, as Turqoise Hexagon Sun ended, he emerged from his trip without ever recalling his radically unordinary and disturbing behavior. Cousin E came back and we explained everything was okay. Then, sister C suddenly perks up and starts talking intensly saying, if I remember correctly. 'I get it. Oh my god, I get it. It all makes sense. It all comes together. If you wish to change something in the future, you can effect it now, by just realizing it before it happens and by free will you can change the events of time before it happens. You can even experience the future before it happens, then you will experience it again. Oh my god, it all makes sense. I know why you guys are the way you are.' Then she sat back, smiled and started bobbing her head to Roygbiv by Boards Of Canada. 

She had not done 5-MeO-DMT as I had said earlier, but still talks about this time revalation and experimentation, which by my amazement is why she was so quiet the entire time. She was simply practicing her new gift of vision. She could soothsay her own immediate future for about ten hours, resulting in what she decribes, a very strange sense of dejavu all the next morning. Everything we did that next day, she remembered in complete detail the night before ever doing them. 

Well that about sums up the experience. Some after effects to note. I usually experience and intensly shitty hangover after a 5-MeO-DiPT trip. My sister noticed it as well. Nobody else that I know of experiences a noticable hangover, although some report an afterglow. Both chemicals were, for me, well worth braving over. I still take 5-MeO-DiPT normally. And will definately try 5-MeO-DMT again. I am also very excited to try DMT now. Thank you for your time.
