My very first DXM experience was from 18 30mg DXM pills (540mg total). I had heard about DXM from a friend who had done the Agent Lemon extraction method from cough syrup, which in my ear sounded a bit too dangerous with all the Zippo fluid and ammonia stuff. Anyway, I stumbled upon a box of these pills and immediately recognized them as DXM. My only reason for not taking DXM before was because of my dislike for the aquiring method, so I thought what the hell, might just give it a try. So I took some (240mg) and waited for an hour. Nothing happened yet so I took some more (now 360mg total). In about an hour I started feeling quite nice; a bit in the party mood. I thought 'hey, this is cool!' so I took some more (now 540mg total). I experienced a feeling of immense well-being and euforia which slowly faded away, lasting for almost 24 hours. The next day I still felt good.

So, encouraged by the experience I decided to try it again, this time with cough syrup. The friend who originally told me about the stuff was going to 'cook' some one friday evening and he also agreed to act as a sitter for me and another eager psychonaut, as he was well experienced with the stuff. So when I arrived at 10pm at my friends place, the cooking was in the last phase and the lemon juice was put on the balcony to cool for a while. After it cooled we took 600mg each and started waiting for things to happen. In about an hour I started feeling like I was drunk, quite unlike my first experience, but still OK. Slight distortion of balance and vision. It then faded away after half an hour and after about two hours from the initial dose I started feeling weird. It came to me suddenly: the realization that I´m totally lost. It was unbelievable. I tried to walk but my right arm and leg refused to work properly and just went round like rotors while the left side of my body functioned properly. At that time a couple of guys called my cellular and I answered (talking seemed to be enormously difficult: 'words don´t come easy', you know). They were behind the door and wanted to buy some weed. I staggered down the hall, through the door and down the stairs, but something kept me to the wall like gravity had suddenly changed direction and I couldn´t get off the wall. I somehow managed to let them in and we went back to the appartment. I felt some discomfort about the situation for I was completely incapable of handling the situation. Still I weighed them their bag of weed and we continued with the trip. I remember almost falling from the balcony while out for a smoke. It felt like my heels had gone higher than my head, although my friend told me I had only slightly leaned over to look down on the street. By the time four hours had passed from the initial dose I started to feel rising discomfort. At this time the other guy trippin´ had to leave. He was quite lost too, but not a much as I.

I decided to try to get some sleep, which turned out to be impossible so I just tried to relax. By this time the sitter started to get tired too and went to sleep to the bedroom. I was now left alone in the living room with the hordes and demons of my subconscious. The next two hours were definitely the worst in my life. I had never experienced such psychic torment. For two hours I felt like I was going to die just NOW. But then it suddenly went away and I felt very relieved. Like a stone was lifted off my head. I was so much relieved I started laughing and went out for a smoke. The next morning I discussed this with my friend and we had a good laugh about it. I decided never to repeat the experience.

As we all know, man is not among the most clever beings in the world, so I decided to try DXM once more. This time only 300mg. I did the Agent Lemon method myself, only I used ascorbic acid (tastes an awful lot better, you should try it out!). I took the stuff and waited. I didn´t feel much effects after 1 1/2 hours so I took the remaining 300mg (a bottle of cough syrup yields 600mg). In fifteen minutes I realized that the first 300 hadn´t even fully begun until now and thought 'oh no, not again, not the same tormenting hours of distress!' For some unknown reason I jumped in my van and drove off to a nearby beach party a few miles away where my friends where drinking and bathing in the sauna. The night-time drive in the woods was quite scary as the DXM started coming on more and more and I just managed to arrive 'safely'. (Never, EVER try the same as I did. Driving under DXM is the craziest and stupidest thing I´ve ever done!) I took some beer and smoked a .5g joint. Cannabis seemed to fit nicely with DXM unlike alcohol. This time the experience was at the edge of being unpleasant.

As we all know, history seems to have the tendency to repeat itself and I once again took 600mg of DXM which I had swore not to do. As a friend of mine so nicely said about DXM: 'It´s a cristal clear state of insanity'. Me and two of my veteran junkie firends took 600mg each. It was a nice, warm summer evening and as it came on we decided to go out. We rolled down the hill on the lawn and it felt like we were bouncing like rubber balls. We ran around in the woods and shouted the most insane things which seemed to me be funny in a mildly twisted way. As the DXM came on more we deicded to smoke some bud. Cannabis is a good way to anchor your consciousness to reality when your starting to lose yourself and your control of thought. I didn´t have any dry stuff so we took a flashlight and went out in the woods towards the weed field. To this day I can´t understrand how we managed to find our way through such difficult terrain. We took the least convenient way and it took at least 30 minutes when it normally would take 5 to get to the spot. I had very much trouble commanding my feet and understanding anything at all. And though I tried as much as I could to avoid stepping on the bushes, I couldn´t. I grabbed some bud and we went back to the house to microwave it dry. We then smoked some and I felt at ease. The experience was once again only a tiny bit away from distress.

The next (5th trip) was approx. 470mg. We had a DXM-rookie amongst us and he experienced about the same discomfort as I did before with 600mg (i.e. the feeling of being totally lost, fear of dying etc.) To me the experience was nearly all pleasing as to the other trippers.

My 6th trip was recorded a bit more in detail. I took the initial dose of 300mg at 8.45pm. It came on in about 1 1/2 hours and was quite pleasing. We listened to some music and I was compelled to dance. Rhythym and sound seemed to fill the room. When the DXM was still on I took an additional 100mg at 12.22pm and it seemed to extend the duration of the first dose without adding to it. At 1.18pm I took 100mg and at 1.32pm I felt like being drunk. Quite similar to the coming on of 600mg.

The next 'morning' we smoked some bud at 4pm and I took 200mg at 4.30pm As it had no noticeable effect I took 150mg at 5.14pm and 150mg at 5.33pm and by the time of 6.20pm I was experiencing something that to me resembled the coming on of MDMA. It lasted only fifteen minutes but it was unlike anything I´ve ever felt.

My 8th trip was 340mg as I didn´t dare to exceed 400mg anymore. Even though the 470mg hadn´t been unpleasant, the physical effects had reminded me of the horrors of 600mg. We went out for a stroll and it was nice. Being on the move seemed to ease the distress and helped me forget the constantly lurking horrors of the memory of my earlier experiences.

My next (9th, 10th & 11th) trips were 300mg, 250mg and 350mg. All in 24 hours. I had invited a friend to try DXM, who formerly had reapeatedly refused, but now for some unknown reason was eager to try it out. He liked his first 300mg so much that he took 300mg twice anew within 24 hours of the first dose.

In conclusion I must quote William White: 'no-one promised it would be completely recreational'. DXM is certainly a very powerful substance and it should never be taken by persons with psychological problems or a weak mind. And it should never be taken more than 50 times in one lifetime. For me, 11 times is enough. Many times later I have experienced the same horror feeling with only lots of cannabis or alcohol or heroin. It seems to have left at least some hole in my head. My friend who hasn´t exceeded 350mg hasn´t experienced anything of the like, but the other guy who took 470mg has reported the same problem: when taking only small doses of other psychoactives that prior to his DXM trip revealed no problems during years of use, now suddenly launch states of horror and irrational fear of varying degree. This doesn´t seem common, but not so uncommon either. So I warn all you fellow psychonauts to act with wisdom. DXM is not something I would reccomend to anyone, although it can be fun.
