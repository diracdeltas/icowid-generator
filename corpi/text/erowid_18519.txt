It was the end of term, and a generally very happy occasion for myself and a bunch of friends a little while ago. We had three weeks of partying until school started up again and we intended to use it to the fullest. The first little experiment we embarked on, and the only one I'm going to talk about here, was one that involved quite a bit of alcohol at one of my friend's places very late at night.

This was the first time I've got truly wasted. I've been slightly drunk before, but never quite this drunk.

The day term broke up we all headed over to his place by bus to have a bit of fun, see some movies, but not before considering the fact that we believed it was necessary for us to all get wasted. Thus, we went out and bought a bottle of Butterscotch Schnapps, and hid it in my bag.

After arriving at his place and eating quite a bit of food, we proceeded to sample the Schnapps (before the movie) in very small quantities. While it had that comforting, burning sensation in the back of my throat like a lot of liquor it tasted like crap - personally, I prefer Whisky, but no matter. We weren't particularly fussy about the taste. We then went down (while my friends parents were out) to his cellar to inspect his stash - he had a box of Vodka 'Ruski's' - a mix of about 7-8% vodka and then lemon juice etc. and another box of Bacardi Breezers (again, about 7% rum and the rest watermelon flavoured water or something.) He also had copious amounts of reasonably light beer, about 4% alcohol, and a lot of liqueur, one kiwi fruit flavoured, which myself and another friend (who also got wasted) tried later without our host's knowing. He also had straight vodka and some whiskey in a cabinet elsewhere, that we also had. Well, I had.

Anyway, at that point we just relaxed, watched some tv, played some video games, all in anticipation of the fun that was to be. So, around 7:00 or so, I consumed (along with most of my friends - there were 7 of us, only 3 of us got pissed) a Bacardi Breezer (we had about 36 or so) and then took another one to drink on the way to the movies. We rocked up at the theater at about 7:45, starting to just feel the first effects of the alcohol - a bit lightheaded, generally pretty happy, joking a bit, but still I was very conscious of my surroundings - it's strange that, when I'm drunk, I can still manage to take in everything with a part of my brain, but the other half just wants to pass out.

Unfortunately, the movie we wanted to see (can't remember what it was) was sold out - thus, we bought tickets for the 9:45 session and walked back to his place (only about a 5 minute walk) to chill out a bit more. At around 8:30 I (and a few others) had a Ruski. They were quite nice, a good deal better than the watermelon Bacardis. I was feeling slightly impaired now, probably due to my relatively low weight. I wasn't falling over and could still feel straight, but I occasionally laughed at inappropriate times.

Then the fun started. We left for the movies at 9:20 (planning to just hang out a bit before the movie started) and myself and a few friends ended up chasing our other three friends who had run off to do god knows what without us.

We then came across four incredibly drunk young girls, who said they wanted to 'thrash' us, and professed that they were _sure_ they knew us. It was sort sad, really. We knew the same thing would happen to us if we drank too much - but of course, that didn't deter us in the slightest.

Unfortunately, the night then turned ugly as one of my friends (the host, in fact) was bashed by some Maori guy (who was, I later found out, considerably drunk) and was left with a split lip and a bleeding nose. After he cleaned up, we watched the movie. 

Now like I've said, I'm not the strongest of fellows when it comes to alcohol tolerance, and while I tried to put on a macho face and say I couldn't feel anything, the truth was I could. Watching the movie was an almost surreal experience; I heard the jokes, but didn't laugh because a) they were bad and b) I wasn't really there. I was sort of floating above, my head bobbing from side to side, observing everthing around me in a wierd kind of way, smiling. Only on the way back to his house at about 11:00 did I start laughing uncontrollably.

Then we got back. I then consumed approximately two more Bacardi breezers and another Ruski (roughly 11:30 now) and was starting to feel the effects even more. This was when my walking was starting to get a little shaky, and I was swaying all over the place. If I sat down, I had trouble getting back up again, and I had this constant desire to sit down and rest. I downloaded a few songs on my friends computer and listening to them was incredibly wierd. I could hear them, but yet again, I couldn't really respond, because I was in this sort of far off drunken land, floating above myself, not quite seeing everything or everyone. I can remember someone started laughing at me when I fell over, and I started laughing back (this was, I believe, the other guy that got pissed) and we both fell over and started laughing again. I couldn't really see him properly, anyway.

What followed was a rather hazy incident I can't remember very well where I and the other guy that was pissed (call him B) ran outside, for some reason. The host caught us, pushed me over and I grazed my arm and my knee. I can't remember feeling any pain, though.

We finished off the Schnapps (sip, sip pass) and then we were pretty drunk (about 12:00.) We went in source of more alcohol and found the vodka and kiwi liqueur we had seen earlier. After making a disgusting cocktail and downing that, we sat down (I nearly passed out) and started watching a movie. That was REALLY wierd. I was lying down, staring at the ceiling, and it almost seemed as though it was collapsing, everything was closing in - and then my friend, I can remember, said 'make sure you don't lie on your back...' and then I finished by saying 'so I don't choke on my own vomit.' It seemed as though as inebriated as I was, I could still think properly, which I pondered for a moment before lying back, stretching out and taking full advantage of this wonderful feeling.

We then played a drinking game with some beer - whereupon I wrecked the entire thing with saying 'yeah, that was worth the whole bottle' and downing that. That was my last sip of alcohol the night. (about 12:45 or so) At this point I was really out of it, I mean completely off the wall. I stumbled upstairs, making loud noises and tripping over on every second stair, until I got to a bedroom. Another friend who was fairly intoxicated then punched a whole in a punching bag with a short sword (don't ask me WHERE that came from) and I was feeling a little scared then. I was drunk, but I had sense enough to tell him to put it down.

Then I started really concentrating on the euphoria. I sat back, closed my eyes and tried to visualize various things. Floating on clouds, flying, falling. For a moment I wasn't in my body, I was soaring, it was amazing.

At about 1:00 in the morning, I passed out on a couch downstairs.

I woke up in the morning at about 11:00 feeling and looking really, really bad. I had some scrambled eggs (bad idea) and then decided it was time to go home. I could still feel some of the effects and I had a bit of a headache. Catching the bus was sort of strange because I was still a bit out of it, and people looked at me in a wierd way. And then, possibly the worst thing that could have possibly happened - happened. I threw up ON THE BUS. This was perhaps the single most embarassing experience in my life, especially because I threw up on my bag.

After walking around a bit and finding a toilet to clean myself up, I went home and slept most of the day.

In short:

I had a great experience, overall, but it was ruined by the morning's hangover. Next time I do this, it'll be in moderation and most definitely NOT until I'm totally intoxicated.
