After doing several batches of cubensis, my body started telling me that something wasn't right. I have never before heard of anyone having really bad physical side effects from mushrooms, so it really confused me when this happened. 

I started coming up and felt my nerves tense up really bad. it was uncomfortable. I could feel all my nerves and muscles tightening and then my inner organs started to hurt. this has happened just about every time I take mushrooms and sometimes on LSD. At times it seems like the poisons are eating up my insides! I am getting sick of it and don't know what could be wrong with me! I think maybe the substances have damaged my body somehow, but I've never heard of that happening. I'm very curious and want to know if this is a common feeling on psychedelics.
