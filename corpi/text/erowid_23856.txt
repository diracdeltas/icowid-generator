I went to a cool party the other night and was talking to some people and doing alot of dancing chemically sober when a very nice drunk fellow handed me some xanax which is an anti-anxiety drug if I am correct and I thought 'EXCELLENT this should keep me from havin a bad trip if I take lsd tonight' so I took the xanax and felt really chill waiting around for an hour and got a hit of acid off of somebody this person usually has the best shit. But I took it and I didn't get shit offa it sides some angry thought but I think I was just tired and kinda pissed about the acid not working. So later I found him and said it wasnt working and this surprised him immensly cuz everyone he hooked up was trippin nutz. Did I get a bad hit? Or did the xanax destroy the lsd effects? Its a possibilty. So I got my money back and scored some XTC and had a nice relaxed roll danced alot but wasnt excatly speeding my ass off.
