I had obtained a bottle of 60 Meperidine/Promethazine Tablets.  I got them due to a minor surgery I had about a week ago.  I didn't really have much pain from the surgery, so I decided to save the pills for later.  A couple nights ago, I took 5 of the pills (250 mg Meperidine and 125 mg Promethazine).  

Anyways, about 15 minutes after I took the five pills, I felt great--the nice opiate buzz and euphoria.  The only thing different is that I was not itching, nor was I constipated.  The effects lasted two hours or so, and it was great.  The Promethazine provides a drowsy effect, and the Demerol provides the euphoria.  Overall, I would say this drug is very good.  It is, unsurprisingly, highly regulated like Oxycodone.  I would give Meperidine!
