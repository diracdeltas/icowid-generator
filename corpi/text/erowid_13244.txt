I have always had a facination with psychedelics and related entheogens, and always had positive experiences. I have had experiences with many psychedelics except for Morning Glory. I had made sure I had untreated seeds (I will not touch store bought seeds). I had three experiences in a three week period. All at a light dose.

My second experiement was the most positive (All 3 were very good experiences). My second trip was with 75 seeds chewed, every single seed was broken with my front teeth and chewed. Myself and a close friend had the exact same experience. After about half hour there was a light discomfort in the stomach, a slight pressure that would come in waves, but not bad at all. After about an hour, we had smoked some Calea and that was the start of our trip.

It was like being in a dream like state for 4 hours. Too light of a dose for open eye visiuals but amazing imagary and thought process, super clear thinking. We listened to music the entire night with each cd controlling the intensity (Dj Kicks mixed by Coldcut peaked it out while an old ambient collection gave some some beautiful imagary. When I mentioned intensity, it is what you make of it at a light dose. It was never intense per say tripping hard.

Each song created its own visual movie. Exactly what I was looking for. I have not need for strong trips anymore. I have already opened those doors. It is it's own unique psychedelic experience just like mescaline, lsd and every type of mushroom is. I'm pretty sure the higher the dose the more side effects and stomach discomfort you will most likely have. Use it in a proper way and you will be rewarded.
