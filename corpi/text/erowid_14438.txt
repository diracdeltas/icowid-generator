This morning I woke up at 7:00 am, on 5 hours of sleep to take 3 Adderall. I had never taken it before, but I expected me to soon feel a cocaine like high. Well, I took 3, waited about 20 minutes and fell asleep again. I woke up 40 minutes later with a little sweat on my chest. My friend had told me that sweating profusely is one of the side effects. He takes 5 a day to workout but only told me to take 3. 

Upon waking up for the 2nd time, I took a fourth and got up to go running. The first half hour of running/walking was awful. I was tired, slow and not into it at all. Not only that I was angry the Adderall didn't work. Then it happened, I got a burst of cheetah like speed. This kept up for the 2 and a half hours that I couldn't stop running and at times to rest, walking. I drank and drank tons of water to stay hydrated. I then went home and worked out on my punching bad for an hour and a half. My arms were like pistons with the adderall. Then it came time to weight lift and I began to feel a little tired until I lifted my first weight. I was an animal, I was maxing out on everything and was looking ripped. I then stopped (albeit my body didn't want to) to eat, but I had no appetite, but seeing as how I had just worked out and needed protein I ate a chicken breast. 10 minutes after eating I had to take a very big shit. So here I am now, 3 hours later, typing and my wrists are killing me when I type.

In short, Adderall is the best workout-enhanced pill I have ever taken. It made me workout like a beast.
