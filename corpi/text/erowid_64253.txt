My friends and I were going to see a movie, but since it sold out before we arrived at the theater, we decided to go home and smoke salvia in lieu of the movie.  I had a fractured foot and had taken a 50mg dose of Tramadol about an hour and a half earlier.  I have smoked salvia on previous occasions, experiencing enhanced tactile sensitivity, laughter, etc.  In other words, I was completely unprepared for what happened.

10:55  -  I measured out 1/10th of a gram of 5x standardized extract and packed it into a bowl.  I hit first, since I was the most experienced with salvia.  I took one full hit from the bong and passed it to my girlfriend.  After about 30 seconds, I got remarkably giddy, and said, 'He he, it's starting to hit me.'  I leaned back a little to laugh, and suddenly the world fell apart.

My vision started to fan out, pivoting around my right periphery, resulting in 7 or 8 rectangular copies of the entire room.  This scared the crap out of me, mainly because I had not intended for such a powerful experience.  I tried to focus on my girlfriend with both eyes.  This helped me to see only one copy of reality again.  As soon as I shifted my vision, however, the edges of objects started to melt and flow horizontally to my left.  Where the edges weren't melting, they glowed and seemed to be lines through reality.  I could almost see something in those lines, but I didn't stare long enough to find out.  I looked down so I could focus on my plain tan carpet, but felt my body being torn apart at a cellular level.

10:58  -  I looked at the clock so I could see how much longer the trip was going to last, and asked my friend how long it had been since I smoked.  She told me it had only been a three minutes. I waited out the last few minutes by concentrating on my girlfriend, and the visuals slowly subsided.   

11:05  -  I smoked some mary jane and lay down.  I felt better, and I also decided never to use salvia in conjunction with an opioid again.
