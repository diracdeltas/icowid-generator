Alright well here's how it went, me and my friends were chilling back in one of my friends garauge when someone got the great idea of buying some cocaine, I was like, alright, bomb, last time I tried coke I had a nasty come down and it made my whole body hurt, so I wasnt to excited to hear that drug mentioned.  Later on we got thestuff and went back to my friends house, and got the shit and injected .5 of coke right into me, When I took the arm band off I had a tingly feeling in my arm and was feeling my chest start to tingle, all of a sudden I started saying What the feck, what the feck!!!!  That was the only way I could describe the experience, all the music I listened to was trippy and had a robotic effect to it!!  My mind was racing and I was clearly up, and the best part is I didnt have a nasty come down, infact I felt normal for the rest of the day!  So to sum it up, injecting cocaine is definetly WTF status. ( thats a good thing )
