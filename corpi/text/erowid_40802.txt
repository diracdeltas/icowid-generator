I had my big toe nails removed.  The doctor perscribed 'ultram' for the pain.

As the local anesthetic wore off, I took took one of the ultram's.  After about 20-30 minutes the pain increased along with a feeling of agitation.  Took another one, and the pain increased to an unbearable level (incredible throbbing) along with developing a terrible headache.  Had to take some motrin to bring the headache and pain down to bearable levels.

I called the doctor and cussed him out. If he would have been within arm's reach, I would have strangled his ass. This drug is someone's chemistry experiment gone wrong.  It should be taken off the market.
