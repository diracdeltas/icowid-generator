To set a background, I have previously experienced LSD, but never before this much, I have also inhaled a fair deal of nitrous. but never before both. I'm only going to detail the joint experience where I was peaking on my acid trip, and inhaled the nitrous.

The Tv was on, everything was wavy, I could see the bass vibrating off the walls. I inhaled the first bulb, and quickly screwed on the second before it got too strong, I breathed out again and inhaled. Immediately after putting the dispenser down I collapsed into the couch.....

The next thing that iIremember

Baboom - wow I am alive
Baboom - Is that my heart beating
Baboom - Wow thats my heart beating
baboom - Breath outwards - wow time is going slow i just breathed
babo..m..  I'll have to breath outwards soon

I'm in a loop, the same moment is going over and over..
breath inwards.
I turn my head to the left, I realise I can control my body. But how, had i lost control of my body? Yes briefly I had.  I turn my head the other way, this is the only control I have.  Control and perception increases, I start to realise I am human, I want to please myself, in the short term, and the long term. I am awakened, it is as if I was born again with all the knowledge I already have.
