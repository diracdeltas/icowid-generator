Heavy Heroin Addiction and Suboxone

I feel mentally torn, Heroin has played it's game with me for probably 6 years. I'm still above water, the addiction dosn't hurt me. I don't seem to withdraw like most people, in fact it took well over 3 years of heavy use to finally withdraw fully. 

So I think to myself, 6 years later clean arms and a fat bank account... Why quit? My girlfriend of 2 years has used for 1 year. To put it LIGHTLY, she's a mess. We're all different I supose. She gets this suboxone, we're both pretty sick, she seems to suffer more than I. My dark cruddy basement apartment, I never clean... Why should I? Five minutes or so after taking it, we're both up and cleaning. The withdrawals are gone. (thank god.) 

So heroin won't work for weeks after a dose you say? I think that's false. I leave 12 hours before I use again, so much for quitting. I take a dose when I withdraw. There is no high, just normalcy. It feels great to be able to kick my habit, but I havn't, I just use sub when I'm sick. I just use sub when I'm sick. 

So... In retrospect... I doubt it's really helped at all, and I'm sure it's just led to us using heroin more. Since there is no negative side to it for me anymore.

<!--Also people, keep in mind. Suboxone builds up in your system, it'll take weeks to leave if you take it for weeks.--> I take one tablet before bed, and by 3pm the next day I'm able to feel the effects of heroin once again.
