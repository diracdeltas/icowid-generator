So around this weekend I was going through my usual morning binge, ravaging the contents of my aunt's medicine cabinet taking advantage of her medical career in order to score some ritalin to snort here and some tylenol 3 to pop there.

After a while there was not much left that had potential for recreational use, but reaching into the far end of the drawer I found  a box of Lexotan, a brand of Bromazepam and associating it with the family of the benzos I happily turned to my computer for informating regarding it.

To be honest I don't remember much, I was well baked as usual but the pills gave me a sense of giddiness, similar to being drunk but with a 'roachie' effect.

Definately not as rough on me as Flunitrazepam and more fun I'd say, considering the former lead me to jail once and the previously mentioned only gave me a fun day.
