Being a ceremonial magician of some 2 decades experience, I have infinite respect for all things shamanic... When some salvia extract popped into my posession I was eager to try to use it to 'commune' with the lady...

What follows is the ritual formula devised and undertaken this saturday afternoon...

1 - Banishing ritual of the pentagram
2 - Banishing ritual of the hexagram
3 - Middle pillar ritual
4 - consecration of both salvia and water bong bought specially for the occasion
5 - Prayer and invocation of the 'lady salvia' asking for guidance and protection during the working

6 - inhalation of said sacrement

7 - prayer of thanks and gratitude to the 'lady'

8 - reversal of all rituals and closing

Result - NOTHING.. Not even a headache for my efforts.. Well bugger me... The water bong works well.. I held it in my lungs till I nearly passed out.... I am not blaming the 'lady' she got her gift and her thanks despite the lack of communion..<!--but you guys must have vivid imaginations.. Or potseeds is sellin shit.-->

Love and light
