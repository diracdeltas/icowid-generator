About 48 hours ago I had been partying all night long and taking lines getting coked up and puffing on some blunts going around.  I had a drug test however 48 hours later in the morning around 9 am.  I started preparing for this the day before I had it. I went looking for supplement 420 and found it, but it cost $55.  That was out of the question so that night I turned to the internet for answers.  That night I drank a good 60 ounces of water, which made me pee about every 10 min.  

I then prepared a small vile of bleach to try and spike my urine with. I also took some vitamins and prepared 40 ounces of cranberry juice and water together which I would drink in the morning.  I woke up at around 730 and urinated. I chilled in bed for another 20 minutes and then went to go take a shower.  

In the shower I chugged down about 20 ounces and took 4 aspirin.  I then finished my other 20 ounces at 8:30 am.  I had urinated about 4 times before I went into the cup.  I was not monitored so I was able to pee freely. I let the first part of my urine go in the toilet and then I let the middle part go in and the end of my urine went into the toilet like the first part.  I then swiped my finger on some bleach and I dipped it in my pee. Then I gave it to the nurse.  It came back that I passed for both coke and weed.  

I have no clue which of my methods actually made me pass but all I know is that they worked.  This test was at a clinic for adolescents who have ADHD and I am only 16 and very frail. My urine was very clear at the time and results were negative so I was very relieved.
