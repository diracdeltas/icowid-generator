I have just smoked a bowl and as I am beginning to feel the warm onset of dope pleasure I am thinking about what Marijuana has done to me. I've only been smoking for a year and-a-half, but my life has definitely changed since that first waterfall. My taste in music has become broadened, I am a calmer person. I feel more generous and loving towards my friends. I think that in general it has made me a better person.<!--, and I try to turn people on to dope whenever I can, they have all felt it to be good.--> I can see the beauty in everything, from a butterfly on a flower to the view of a night city from high up. However I do feel that Anti-Motivational Syndrome is a real thing, but I have tried to be a 'responsible' user and  always tried to complete my studies. Weed has allowed me to see things differently, it really has expanded my horizons. The general idea is that I feel Marijuana is an important part of my life, I probably am mildly addicted, but I can be responsible with my use and intake. The dangers do not outweigh the benefits, it is not a gateway drug for me. It is beautiful and everytime I hit the pipe I feel proud to be smoking.
