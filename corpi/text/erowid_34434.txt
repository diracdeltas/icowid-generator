Crushed and lined out.  Sniffed up my nose in about 30 seconds. Almost no pain, but enough to recognise it's there. It left me feeling almost instantaniously jumpy and talkative.  I kept spinning and jumping as if the effects of a normal 200 mg dosage was smashed into 10 minutes.  For a while the same effects lasted.  After the 10 minutes, I was left with a running nose and much mucous in my mouth and respiratory system.  Coughing from coming down lasted about an hour.  The running nose lasted 1.5 hours.
