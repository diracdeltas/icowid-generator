The only thing I had ever smoke at this point was weed.  I didn't know anything about it, had never been educated on what it was and the effects.  I had tried coke, but didn't really like it because it gave me a headache. 

My Ex-Boyfriend set up a small glass pipe and melted a rock onto the brillo pad *which I found out about all that later after doing it several times*  He made me breathe all out and slowly draw on the glass pipe and I saw white fog going up the pipe into my mouth and couldn't stop breathing in until he took the lighter away.  At first, I didn't really feel it because he only gave me a small hit, but then he made me do it again and held the lighter up longer and it hit me as soon as I stopped breathing and breathed it out....a small cloud went up and I was hooked.  It was an instant euphoria and I loved it.  

Till much later on when I began to spend all of my extra rainy day cash on it while still paying bills.  Then a couple weeks later, and I was spending it on that instead of food or cigarettes, my friend intervened and I moved away to get away from that scene.  I couldn't imagine it have gotten any worse, but I'm sure it could have if I had been so bad to start tricking like you see on tv or in the big inner cities.

My best friend I met while in treatment warned me.  'I pray to God that you never have to experience any of that.'  And I never understood what she meant, until now.<!--So it is my hope to warn potential or current users that haven't gotten 'quite' so bad...and as with any other addiction, you have three ends.  Jails, institutions, or death.-->
