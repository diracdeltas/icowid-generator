Hey I don't mean to crash your party, but -->I might have found evidence of some neurotoxic issues with some of the research chems. I have tried moderate doses of all the above chems. over the last 3 years and I have recently developed muscle twitches and spasms that may or may not be linked to the drugs.

Over the last three years I have smoked Foxy a few times at 10mgs or less, snorted the T7 three times at 10mgs or less, eaten the T2 once and smoked at twice at 10mgs or less, and most recently I smoked the Meo-DMT twice, once at 5mgs and once at 10mgs and eaten 2-CE one time as well as snorting it one time. My medical conditions have developed most recently, within weeks of my last 2-ce experience.

<!--Could 2-CE be neurotoxic to your dopamines?
I will keep you posted on my medical diagnosis.-->
