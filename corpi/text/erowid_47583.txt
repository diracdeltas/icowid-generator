I can only speak through my experiences. I regularly take SSRI's for depression. For me, the day after MDMA is full of fatigue and depression, by the fifth day after, the depression was noticably worse. After speaking with friends it was clear that there had been a dramatic change in my behaviour that I could not see. They described it as a larger presence of general depression, as well as a lack of social behaviour. 

I can only speak for myself, but I have concluded my use was not worth it. I wait here worrying when I will return to myself before I started using.
