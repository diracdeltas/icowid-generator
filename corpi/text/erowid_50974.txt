I've only ever been a mild Marijuana user, I heard about Salvia Divinorum online and bought some 10x from an online store.

I did a little research, decided that I'd better be in a positive mood to try this and also not to use too much as '10x' could be strong for a first time.

I received my package and made a little spliff.  I took about 2 hits and decided to stop, wait and see.  After about 1 minute, I realized nothing was happening.  I smoked the whole spliff, felt a little light headed.  But nothing else, I really wanted to get an experience so I rolled up and lit up again.  Totally 2 spliffs nothing.
