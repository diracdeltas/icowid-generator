Last year I was really bored and all i did at the time really was weed and alchohol.  I really wanted to try someting better but i had a lack of resorces and funds so i decided to take my prescription pills.  Hydrocodone (generic for vidocine) I heard about vidocin on the news, and how it made people feel good and how people got addicted and stuff.  So at first i took 2 instead of the recommended 1.  I felt a little different but not much, kinda light headed at times.  The I tried taking 3 the next day.  That made me feel a little more light headed but i fell asleep to miss most of the experience.  

So I move on to four the next day at school.  I took them before school and they kicked in about 2 hours (2 1/2 periods) later and man was i fucked up.  I felt like i was half asleep and half awake.  I was so happy that i got a feeling and it felt really good.  After like 10 minutes though i started feeling too light headed, and every thing started going purple like when I stand up to fast or when I smoke alot of weed.  It felt similar to a cafine pill experience which i did not like.  I started getting really parinoid and i thought i was gonna die.  So I difficultly got up and asked the teacher if i could go to the bathroom, planning to throw it all up because i was feeling real nausiated.  He did not expect anything so i guess i was acting kinda normal.  I did not throw it up however because while walking i started feeling better.  I went through a stage of feeling good then feeling bad like every 10 minutes.  After about 2 hours and lunch i was feeling pretty much normal again.  I am not doing this again.
