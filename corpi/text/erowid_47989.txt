<!-- I don't know if this is the right forum for this or not, but -->I am a 22 year old mother of a 22 month old little girl.  I am a full time nursing student and I am a part time sales associate at a local Radio Shack.  

On November the 7th I was given a 'random' drug test by the school of nursing.  On the next day I attended my first clinical.  At lunch time I was informed by the instructor to go see the division chair at the Jasper campus, Ms. R*.  When I arrived at the nursing building, I was approached by another instructor, Mrs. C* who proceeded to inform me that I had a positive drug test, and asked me if I take any prescription medications.  To which I informed her that I take 40 mg of prozac.  So I go a copy of the prescription, and by then I was able to talk to Ms. R*.  She informed me that I had tested positive for Benzodiazapines.  I basically told her that's impossible, so here's the question:  How can Prozac, dyphenhydramine (Benedryl which is OTC), and Tri-Levelen (birth control pills) cause a false positive for benzodiazapines????  <!-- Please help.  This is not the kind of trip I want to go on for the holidays!!!!-->
