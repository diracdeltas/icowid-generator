I've been growing my san pedro cacti for a good year and a half now, and aside from the first trip the cactus let me try, this was only my second encounter with the sacred cactus. The first trip was nice and mellow. I took a 12 inch cutting and made it into tea by putting it into a blender and boiling it for some time until it was boiled down pretty well. I drank the tea after some reast.

But now to the experience at hand. I got curious and woundered if smoking it would produce any effects similar to the tea. So I took a good size slice out of my cacti and let is dry. I made a make-shift bong. When the cactus was dry enough to smoke, I loaded it into the bowl and lit up. After I was finished, I decided to get creative and load some catnip that I've been toaking on as a MJ alt. and also thew some   tobacco in the mix. Lit that up and loaded another cactus bowl, this time with some wormwood extract capped on top of it. Well in retrospective, this experience was nice for a all legal mix. Wasnt as good as the tea, and I didnt expect it to be. I felt slightly trippy for about ten minutes and this seemed to slowly taper off over the niext half hour.
