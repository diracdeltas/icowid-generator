The night began with a get-together at a friend from work's house. I take a 2 MG xanax before even walking into the door. After a while of hanging out, I decide its time to get a little drinking done. I had been warned about mixing pills and alcohol, but I had no clue how serious they were. I played it off. I said I'd be fine... But I proceed to take 4 shots of licorice hard liquor. After this, I decide its time for another 2 mg xanax. I take half, and insufflate the other. By this time, I have a pretty good buzz going. And I was talking a lot.

The next thing I know I wake up... In bed... I feel fine. I dont question anything. I just get out of bed like I always do. But I have 4 missed calls on my phone. It's my buddy from work. He's wanting to know if I'm ok. I wondered why he cared since he gets trashed all the time, just never off pills. He's strictly a drinker only. Well, as I'm calling him back, I walk onto the front porch to find that my car is a block down the road. Parked kinda funny. My friend proceeds to tell me that he fought with me for an hour not to drive home last night. He states that I was falling in the hallways and actually had me hang out, drink water, and sober up before I left, none of which I remember. 

This doesnt seem like the worst of nights, but realizing that I didnt remember any of this was very scary. I had no recollection of the night before at all. I woke up and felt fine. This will forever end my mixture of pills and alcohol. It is very unnerving actually knowing that I didn't remember anything.
