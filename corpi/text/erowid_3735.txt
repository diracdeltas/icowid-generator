I bought two cans of it. I'm from Portugal and here we buy it as anasthetic. People use it on injuries just like Soccer Players.
I already tried it, but nothing like this tike. First I soak it on my shirt e sucked it. The rush it gave was the best. I heard from a friend to do it reapeatedly during the rush so I did. For about Ten times.

I was all numb, I could control my body. I couldn't move. I felt afraid but also in an RUSH that I can't express, I just love it and wanted more. Until I passed out. Even aware of the danger and the extreme bad things that I did to my body. Although I fainted 4 times in that day. Best thing in the world. I've tried drinking, cannabis & this. From all of those, Ether is the only substance that I still use.
