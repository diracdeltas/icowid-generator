The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]

For my first experiment, I ingested 12 seeds that had been crushed and soaked in water for 1 day. The effect was similar to a painkiller, which is not what I was looking for. For my second experiemnt, I took 15, ground and eaten plain. The same effect. 10 days after this experience, I was still feeling pain varrying in location from my fingers/finger tips to my legs. It felt as if I had a puncture wound.<!--I can only assume that this was poisoning from the reputed cyanide that the seeds contain.-->
