Off and on, I have been using cocaine for several years.  Up until this year, use was infrequent - perhaps once every six months or so.  Earlier this year I went into an atrocious depressive/anxiety ridden state during which I had a relapse of bulimic tendencies and during which I left sobriety behind for a period of about 2 months.  I had just entered school once again and was financially stable for the first time in my life... suffering from ennui and a sense that my success was undeserved.  Being a perfectionist, the stress became overwhelming and I spent about $1000 on cocaine (and nothing else, really, being devoid of human contact) over that 2 month period.  Cocaine use and bulima are not a pleasent combination... the side effects of the coke were horrendous.  I had difficulty breathing, sleeping, getting up the motivation to leave my home and the like.  I lost all desire to get involved in social interaction, my dopamine and norepinephrine levels were extremely low (bulimia produces a similar high to that of the 'first line' in me).

Eventually, I lost all self control... felt like shit, yet once that first line was in my system, I couldn't stop until my body seriously protested.  The last night I went overboard I felt an acute sense of impending death.  I had an episode akin to paroxysmal tachycardia (a form of arrhythmia consisting of difficulty breathing, chest pain, palpitations, profuse sweating, frequent urination, etc.).  Well, I basically frightened myself out of my depression and got a handle on my situation.  I mainly just wanted to give some advice on helpful supplements for those either recovering from cocaine use or those who just had one of those nights.  Cocaine alters the balance of chemicals in the brain and can cause problems with depression, apathy, endorphin effects, etc.  Here are some supplements you may consider taking.

- L-Tyrosine (an amino acid that assists with low levels of dopamine and epinephrine)

-L-Carnitine (assists with brain function)

-LOTS of vitamin B6 (up to 1500% DV)

-Lecithin (a major source of choline, an essential element for healthy brain function)

-Magnesium and Calcium (relaxes muscles and improves nerve function)

-Milk thistle, dandelion root (or anything else that helps cleanse and improve liver function)

-thiamine, niacin, folic acid, potassium, riboflavin, vitamins E,A, C, D, Copper

Keep yourselves healthy and happy!  Getting proper nutrition makes a world of difference.  Good luck, all.
