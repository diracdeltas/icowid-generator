I started using 1,4-Butanediol as a health supplement, hoping to mimic the growth hormone releasing effects of GHB.  I used at least 3 grams daily (solution has 9 grams per ounce of liquid) for a period of 6 months with occasional binges on weekends.  I found the effects comparable to alcohol intoxication and would indulge in it instead of drinking.  I was always very safe and responsible with my doses.  I noticed no side effects at all from my use (other than some small stomach pain after binges) until I recently stopped (I ran out and hadn't ordered more.  This did not concern me, as I don't consider myself addicted).  A few days after stopping I noticed a strange coldness in my feet and fingers, despite 100+ degree temperatures outside.  I would also become dizzy often when I stood up.  The most worrisome side effect was a nagging pain in the left side of my chest.  The pain came and went, accompanied by a racing pulse, often getting so bad I considered going to the emergency room.  After about 2 weeks the side effects stopped and I've been completely normal since.  I have more now, but have decided not to continue with its usage do to these effects.
