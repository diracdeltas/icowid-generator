Back in my high school days I was willing to pop anything with multiple letters and numbers in the name into my stomach.  I had already experimented with other legal 'research drugs' such as DXM and 5MEO-DMT, but was looking for something new and different.  A friend of mine ordered up some DIPT on the internet and I swallowed about 50mg.  

It didn't take long for me to start feeling a tad sick and dizzy, and before long I was riding the porcelain pony.  It had only been about 45 since I had taking the drug and I wasn't expecting to get any effects.  

I still didn't feel all that well so I bid farewell to my friend and hopped in my car to drive home.  I didn't feel like I was under the influence, maybe just a slight buzz.  Then, out of nowhere 'Paranoid Android' came on the radio and Thom Yorke sounded like some sort of........well.....android!  I felt like he was some sort of alien or robot singing to me, and frankly I wasn't impressed.  I changed the station only to listen to a robotic rendition of 'Heartbreak Hotel.'  

It was definitely interesting and a cool new experience, I looked forward to getting home.  As I walked through my front door it felt like I was underwater. The air seemed thick and dense and I could hear whooshing noises all around me.  My mom began to talk to me but I couldn't pay attention to what she was saying, only how she sounded.  The drug continued to have effects as I watched television, never before has the Downy teddy bear sounded so creepy.  

The drug eventually wore off and the hangover was mild to non-existent.
