Kaptin of Kratom 

I felt I just had to write a report after reading a couple of others. It just goes to show how different effects can be on differant people.  I read a report about a guy on here who drank kratom and just felt nauseated and barely buzzed.

Well I am an experienced opiate user and I must say, for being widely available on the internet and cheap, it is worth it.  It truly feels like codeine with a hint of caffeine in it. It truly feels like codeine with a hint of caffeine in it.  I have really bad depression and always like medicating with, but opiates but recently stopped because its withdrawl effects suck to much.  When I drank my tea from a 1/4oz of dried kratom leaves, I felt like a had popped a good 40mg of codeine.  I must note that it worked on the mind like a pain killer, but the pain in my back was not relieved by kratom.  I thought this might be an interesting factoid.  I like the taste of the tea, because I love bitter tastes, though I still cannot swallow Calea!! I dont know anybody that like it.  

The main point I want to get across is kratom feels good for being legal. A no hassle way to enjoy a day.  Great for working too!
