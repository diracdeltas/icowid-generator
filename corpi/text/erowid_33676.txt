Experience: First time with Iprocin (4-HO-DiPT).  I also have experience with Mescaline, 2C-I, 2C-E, LSD, LSA, Mushrooms, Salvia, DXM, Ketamine, MDMA, MDA, Methylone, and Cannabis as for the 'mind' drugs. 

Mindset: Good mood, experimental.

Method of dosing: Capsule. 

Trip Dose and Duration: 15mg, 4:30PM to 10:00PM 

Medications: None 

It was 4:30pm at my girlfriend 'X's' house and we just took our Iprocin at 15mgs each.  We figured that this would be a dose that would give us a decent trip that would get us to a +1 or +2 on Shulgin's scale.  We were just looking to get a really nice connection with each other and have a good first experience.  We ended up having a very pleasant surprise.  

At 4:40pm we were both already getting a very slight alert; the feeling that something is there, though you can't hardly tell, but at 4:50pm, it was definitely there.  I had a slight urge to smile, and I felt a slight body stimulation.  However, though these effects increased, nothing major happened until the peak.  The period of coming up was just a little rough.  It most likely was because we were in her bedroom, which is really not that big, and it was somewhat messy.  The environment was making me a little uncomfortable, but it was very cold out, and neither of us felt like getting dressed appropriately for a walk.  I imagine a walk would have been perfect to ease the uncomfortable part.  I was getting mild CEV's, which were definitely reminiscent of those from mushrooms.  I had to use my imagination to get them to come in, but they were forming nicely from time to time.  

The trip was getting stronger as I was staring at X standing in the middle of her room.  I was telling her about how the "Salvia Goddess" that I had talked about from one of my Salvia trips took on the image of her, and who she is in my life.  I was just staring at her face, and it almost brought me to tears.  The sensory distortions, perceptual changes, and vibes were getting more intense.  As we talked, I felt a stronger connection.  We were listening to one of my CD's that had various songs that I like to trip to on it.  The song "Soulfly II" by Soulfly is what kicked the trip off.  That is when we decided to go out onto the porch and smoke some Cannabis.

After that, it really kicked in.  It was fairly dark out, and I realized that Iprocin is definitely a night-time chemical.  We lit some candles and started listening to a new CD that I burned some old King Crimson on, and it started shaping the trip.  This is where the trip started moving towards a +3.  It was unexplainable.  I had overpowering vibes and sensations running through me to each perceptual change, and it was causing my visuals to intensify.  All of these effects were perfectly going together, and I realized that I hadn't felt that "Tryptamine" feeling since the last time I used mushrooms a year ago.  It was a very pleasant feeling.  I had the cold/shaky body feeling that mushrooms give me as well.  The time distortion was moderate, and I was having rapid thought loops.  The
connection I had with X was indescribable.  I was filled with renewed feelings of love for her as we were deep in conversation.  I had profound empathy towards all of the minor problems that had been going on in our relationship, and I had the feeling that the Iprocin was working us through it, and allowing us to see more clearly the things that really matter in life.  

Everything ran together with the music.  When the music was upbeat and happy, me and X were laughing and talking deep into things, and then, no matter how quickly the music turned to serious and spiritual, our moods turned all the same.  It was "perfect."  I was having plenty of epiphanies or "revelations."  Some of the things I was saying from either a philosophical or psychological point of view were blowing X's mind away.  We were having a conversation when all of a sudden I had somewhat floated away from my body and saw what was going on as if it was a play.  I suddenly got the feeling that, with the candle lit room, the soft music, and the angle that we were sitting on her bed talking, that we were shooting a romantic scene in a movie.  I felt like there were cameras everywhere and I couldn't even talk anymore.  The feeling sent me to a different world.  We just laughed as we were feeling the same things all night.  Iprocin has a similar "wave" feeling that mushrooms do, and it also was giving me that classic "trip" feeling that something just flew past me, or something is behind me, and I start acting somewhat tweaked or something.  Then I just laugh.  It's very hard to explain.  

The music went so perfectly with everything.  It was so strange that I could look at X in so many different ways.  At one point, the music was making me feel like I was involved in a spiritual ritual in India, burning incense, and sitting in an Indian style position.  The visuals were powerfully intense and unexplainable.  They would move from something really serious, deep, earthy, and spiritual, to something cartoonish with
alot of laughter much like mushroom visuals.  At one point, me and X were into conversation, and my "visual" field was patterning behind her head into a purple kaleidoscopic background, with yellow umbrellas dancing around.  It was hard to keep a train of thought when hallucinating like that.  Then, I got the feeling like I was under water.  Then my visuals morphed into a wooden, sunken boat under the sea with different types of fish swimming out of holes in the boat.  There was a sea horse playing a trumpet (note, there was a trumpet in the King Crimson song we were listening to) and there were random objects coming out of the tube of the trumpet.  Even as X talked, I could "see" the words coming out of her mouth.  The mood changes were just as incredible. 

Next, we were listening to the King Crimson song "In the Court of the Crimson King."  Throughout the song, we just had conversation, but we started to realize the intensity of the time distortion.  Over and over again, we kept hearing the end of the verses right before the chorus, and then the chorus coming in.  It seemed like the song was lasting an eternity.  There was a strong mind twist.  Everything made perfect sense, and everything was complete confusion at the same time.  At times, there was also a strong feeling of introspection.  I was preaching to X about philosophy, and we were talking about society.  I was bringing up my quote, "I like being real in a fake world."  

From there, the trip was slowly tapering off.  We were listening to my soft ambient CD "Cathedral Oceans."  The vibes and visuals were still going strong, but I just felt that sense of release.  From there, we started kissing and getting extremely sensual.  We did sexual things, but not intercourse yet.  The tactile enhancement and psychological aspect of sexual interaction was unlike any other psychedelic I've used.  Some of it could have been the fact that this is the first girl that I've been comfortable with in that way under the influence of psychedelics, but I know some of it was the effect of the drug itself.  After that, we went out in the kitchen and X put a pot pie in the oven.  She mentioned that they take about 30 minutes to cook, so we decided to go back into her room and actually have sex.  It was awesome as well.  There was something completely spiritual about it.  There was a connection that was beyond physical, psychological, and emotional.  

Afterwards, we ate a little, talked about art, philosophy, and I was playing some strange stringed instrument that I can't think of the name of at the moment.  I play guitar, so I was able to pick up on a couple things with it.  X's Mom just keeps it in the living room for decoration.  Then, I saw a crayon picture that X's nine year old sister 'S' drew of an ocean scene with the sunset gleaming down on it.  It was a masterpiece work of art to me...Absolutely beautiful.  The introspection was more profound at the end of the trip where everything was more focused.  The feeling of the effects wearing off was slow and gradual.  It was very comfortable.  I did feel mentally drained, but that was expected.  

Then, X's Mom and her little sister came home.  I had a divine understanding of her family, childhood, and many other things, and I could almost "feel" it like I was experiencing being a child again.  Since X really didn't get the most out of her childhood, she has a unique childlike character that comes out at times.  I found that I could really see into things with Iprocin.  After that, I was in a moment of psychoanalysis
with X's Mom.  It became a little much because there are things that I have learned about her.  She has alot of "inside" issues that cause me to believe she possibly has a social/personality disorder.  She sometimes comes off as childlike in how she handles things in a negative way.  Obviously, since this is X's Mother, she is sensitive to the topic, so I didn't want to get into it much.  There are just alot of things there that make me uncomfortable.  

At the last part of the trip, we watched the movie "Cabin Fever."  Man, was that wild!  I don't want to get into the gory details of the movie, but for those who have seen it, you probably know why the movie would be insane to watch tripping.  As for me, I love things like that, but I cannot believe X actually watched the whole thing.  I felt like I was a part of the movie, and when I left her house that night, I felt like I had the disease from the movie.  It was giving me some cool vibes.

The next day, I had a really good afterglow.  Since this was the first Tryptamine I've used other than the chemicals in mushrooms, and I hadn't used them in so long, I wanted to list some basic differences between them and the Phenethylamines that I have been using lately.  So far, I've tried 2C-I, and 2C-E.  They were both amazing.  2C-E, in as much as it stood up to the great LSD in intensity, it still had a clear aspect of the mind.  I get the feeling with the PEA's that I notice something while tripping, I analyze it and break it down, feel it and understand it to the furthest extent possible, and then it is complete.  I can really "focus" on the music and let it become the core aspect of the experience.  It's like a learning tool.  Iprocin, mushrooms, and probably many other Tryptamines work differently.  With those, I get a wave.  At times, I feel completely happy, and then I will get totally serious and spiritual.  The visuals switch focus, and I get alot of mood changes.  There isn't a positive mood lift as with the 2C-X's.  Iprocin was very deep and meaningful, but I just found that there are so many variations in psychedelic effects.  You just have to learn to respect each of them for what they are.  

Overall, Iprocin is definitely something I will be experimenting with again.  I already have developed a profound respect and love for it.  I didn't mention too much about duration, but the total experience lasted from about 4:30pm being the point of ingestion, until around 10pm.  I'd say the peak lasted a good 2 hours.  It was a full and rich experience.
