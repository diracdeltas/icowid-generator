As I sit here and write this, I can't help but think of the euphoric waves that are currently rolling slowly down my body.  Nothing else could give me this feeling, at least not anything I had ever come across.  The trebles of the music glided over my ears, thousands of them flood my spine.  My ear canals have somehow molded into the tissues of my neck to allow a sensation that only can feel like the skull has melded with the back.  With little warning, gravity suddenly raises to different levels of my body.  The torso, now cumbersome and heavy, falls into rest and remains there even though the slightest jolt could send it in a gyrating motion on the hips.  Hands don't even follow the direction of normal gravity because they are accelerated at a 45 degree angle to the horizon pushing forward.
