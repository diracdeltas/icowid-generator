I take adderall for A.D.D. and smoke alot of pot, and most of the time I'll pop some pills when I smoke, mostly seroquel. The high I felt was a 'mind blowing experience' I was just blown to shit and it was awesome, I didnt feel sick or anything, just tired but that is one of the effects of this drug.
