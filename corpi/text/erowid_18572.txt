FOAF got this stuff mailorder off the internet...because I wanted to see if he could supercharge his brain.  Reported that he always reads 2 newspapers during his lunch hour, after taking piracetam for 4 days he was finishing both papers in half an hour reading all sections 'cover to cover'...He said he went back inside to punch the time clock and noticed he still had half an hour while he was sure his reading had taken the normal period...

Also reported much faster reasoning while doing his work as a car salesman, finishing most tasks in half the time it usually took him...Overall he was very pleased with his purchase and reported no ill side effects...this drug doesn't make him high, it makes him smarter.
