Ketamine IV

I had access to some liquid ketamine in the 10/100 mg dosage.  I had never done ketamine or known anyone who had done it but was interested because it boasted psycoactive effects for only a reasonably short period of time.  So one night after I had gotten home, I was still a bit buzzed from some dank KB earlier.  I drew out a half cc of the K.  I used a leather shoe lace as a torniquit and injected it directly into the main blood vessel right at the elbow in my left arm.  I released the torniquit and immediatly felt the effect.  The first thing I felt was a sense of relaxation then my vison narrowed and I because very unable do do anything, much like being very drunk it was difficult to walk.  I remember seeing visions of things that are so weird now but seemed so normal at the time(I saw a rectangluar shaped box right in front of me rimmed by chipmunks with chainsaws rotation clockwise).  I fell assleep soon after and slept 12 hours that night.  It was like I was living out a dream but in another person's body.  Very wierd feeling.  This was the first time I had done any drug MJ so it was very intense compared to pot.

This was a few days ago and I have sense done it two more times.  It has gotten better each time I have done it even though I havent changed the dosage.<!--I would reccomend K to anyone who wants to have an trip but doesnt want to messed up for a long time.  -->  I have read that the IV method is not bad but it seemed to work fine for me, it just seems like I am a heroin addict or something and I dont liek that part io the IV method.  Ketamine seems like something that I think I may do like once a month and be content with that.
