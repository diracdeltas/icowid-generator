I was out in my garage huffing gas. I blacked out and all I could see was a little black room with a man and a hose, the man left leaving me all alone in the room, I thought it was real and I started crying I didnt know how I was goin to get out and I thought I was trapped there forever, I returned to my normal state and I tried to stand up and I hit my head knocking myself unconcious. I deffinatly did not like this experiance and I dont recommend any huffs gas.
