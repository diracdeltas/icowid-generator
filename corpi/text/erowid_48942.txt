7:00 PM - One of my younger siblings is prescipred Buspirone for stress/anxiety disorder. I researched it and discovered it produced a 'high' in individuals taking over the recommend dosage.  Out of curosity I shamefully took 5 (5 mg) pills from the orange bottle inside the medicine cabinet. I then went into my room, turned on some soft jazz-esque music, and popped the pills downing it with some pepsi expecting to have an intense trip (I had read people feeling effects as low as 7.5 mg). The drug began taking effect almost immediately  as I began to feel relaxed and slightly Euphoric.

7:30 PM: Effects remain virtually the same except for a slight feeling of drowsiness. Music doesn't sound distorted or diffrent.

7:45 PM: Blurred vision, slight nausea, and a feeling of overwelming lethargy.

8:00 - 9:30: Buspirone seems to have worn off, I feel lazy, queasy, tired, and disappointed.

Conclusion: Buspirone doesn't do much and the negative effects outweigh the positive. The experience might be more enjoyable if combined with cannabis, which I plan on trying soon.<!-- But I don't recomend wasting your time on this only.-->
