My purpose with this report is to try to dispel any notion that absinthe will produce an effect similar to cannabis or to any hallucinogen. People who are looking for an 'absinthe high' will be truly dissapointed, as well as people who are steeping dried wormwood or essential worwood oils in alcohol, the result of which will only be some foul tasting stuff.

I will report on three commercial brands (produced in countries where absinthe is legal): Hill's from Czech Republic, Lasala and Deva from Spain.

Hill's is nothing more than some strong vodka (140 proof) with food coloring. It will only get you drunk fast and give you a hell of a hangover in the morning.

Lasala (100 proof)is a better product. It is yellow and turns to a milky light yellow when mixed with water. After three glasses (1 part absinthe and 3 parts water) dunk with friends lent to stimulating conversation and nothing more.

Deva (100 proof) reportedly has the highest thujone (the active ingredient of wormwood) content of any absinthe in the market (I am familiar with approximately a dozen brands). It is definetely the best quality of the one's that I've tried in taste, apperance and effect. Poured out of the bottle it is green in color with a stong smell of both anise and woormwood. When mixed with water it turns (louches) into a milky pearly white liquid with a touch of green (a beautyful visual effect).

The 'absinthe effect' is very subtle. YOU DO NOT GET HIGH. It's more of a lucidity, speech becomes very articulate and ideas clear. You don't feel drunk. That's it. I like to drink with friends and perhaps go out to a club afterwards to have a nice sociable time. It takes me a little while to go to sleep after a night of drinking absinthe. The next morning I usually wake up relaxed (not wanting to get out of bed) but without any hangover.

Nice drink if you ask me.
