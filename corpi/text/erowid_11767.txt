I ordered a 13 inch long section of cactus from an online store.  It came about a week later in a cardboard poster tube. It was about 2 inches across. I started by peeling off the waxy skin of the cactus being careful to leave the part right under the skin intact. The best way I found to do this was to cut it lengthwise to seperate the cactus part from the woody pulp in the middle. Then to carve the spines out with the tip of a sharp knife. (Much easier than trying to pull them out). After they are out then peel the skin off in strips in order to preserve the part under the skin. Then I put all the sections in a blender with a little water and lemon juice and blended until liquified. This filled the blender all the way to the top with a mixture that looked like a lime green slurpee. It dosn't smell too bad but it is very bitter taste and seperates into a liquid and foam level after a few minutes. It is better to scoop the foam off with a spoon a throw it in the sink then to try to gag it down. (Imagine stale beer foam that tastes like baking soda). 

It took a full hour to finish the contents of the blender, taking big swigs every few min. The effects took almost 3 hours to start. The walls started shifting and the carpet was growing but it was not too intense. The body high was great. Almost like taking vicoden. It's a different trip than either lsd or mushrooms. It lasted another 5 hours before I went to bed. If I would have taken a 17 or 18 inch section I think it would of been one hell of a good (and strong) trip but the hassle of preparing and even worse, drinking that nasty stuff makes it not worth while.
