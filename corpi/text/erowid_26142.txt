I'll make this one brief – I found an interesting drug combo. Soma, Ultram and Alcohol seem to have an interesting synergistic affect on one another. For me 200mg of Soma (tramadol) is an ok time, anything over 200mg and I get VERY nauseous – I mean VERY, VERY, and it lasts about 8 hours without ever vomiting. 600mg Ultram (carisoprodol) is a good time – easy going, nothing too spectacular. But combine the 2, and add a couple of shots of alcohol (only a couple – Soma + too much alcohol = BAD NEWS) and WOW. It's hard to describe, but it takes you into another world. There aren't any hallucinations, as such (DAMN!) but the mind effects are very distinct and unforgettable. Just keep in mind that both Tramadol and Carisoprodol are easy and fast to develop a tolerance to. So leave a few days in between journeys.
