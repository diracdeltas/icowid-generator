My paxil used to make me hallucinate mildly, this time it's gotten much worse.  

I've decided to get off this godforsaken crap, and i weaned myself off of the drug...  I got lazy and after two days of weaning just got up and stopped taking the pills.  I know this is a bad idea for I understand all of the potential risks there are from discontinuing use of SSRI's spontaneously.  

This being my second day of not taking the medication, i am being plagued by what they call 'Zaps'.  It's basically a split second headrush that hits me whenever I move my body or turn my head.  However they are getting noticably worse as the day progresses.  I am typing this and it feels as if my vision is about to start tunneling... I am extremely fatigued, and feeling quite faint but i am not going to start taking the pills again...

I am not feeling any cravings whatsoever but I am feeling a withdrawal and at times it's interesting but it is getting to the point of being overwhelming.
