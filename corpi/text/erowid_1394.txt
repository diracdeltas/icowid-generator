In school we are doing a landscaping project, hearing about this i was suddenly struck with the idea of suggesting we grow morning glorys, after talking it over with my class and telling them my reasons for suggesting it the decision was unanimous. once the seeds arrived a friend of mine stole a package of 'flying saucer' morning glory seeds, i proceeded to eat roughly 20, i have read on many occasions where people ate over 200, i received a nice warm feeling, and was very lethargic and euphoric, i thing eating close to 300 would be uncomfortably intense i was satisfied my 20, so anyone looking for a cheap LEGAL drug alternative try morning glory, a dose of about 20-30 produces marijuana like affects with only slight stomach discomfort, which subsided after i had something to eat.
