Took at approx 3AM mixed in with a cup of apple juice.  Taste wasn't bad, but not something I'd drink for pleasure.  Slight nausea set in around 3:30... has continued to 7:30AM.

Noticed a slight boost of energy in this time, but very very tired now.

I will not be trying kratom again.  Perhaps dosage wasnt enough for more effect, but it may also increase nausea.
