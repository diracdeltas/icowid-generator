So, I bought 14 grams of Wild Dagga pedals. I tried smoking it, and after several bowls, I thought I might've felt something. It was such a small hint of a buzz, I wasn't quite sure if I was even high. 

Then I tried making tea. I emptied two Lipton tea bags, filled them with the pedals, and restapled them. I boiled some water and let the two bags soak for about 15 minutes, squeezing them occasionally. I drank the first cup and almost felt something again, so I drank another cup. 

I've come to the conclusion that I just can't get what I'd consider a buzz on Wild Dagga. I won't be wasting anymore time and money on it.
