[Erowid Note: 
Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe recreational use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.] 

When my friends and I did this we thought we were doing difluoroethane (computer duster). I have not done computer duster before but I intend to shortly. First time I did it I was at a friends house and we found a bottle of some kind of duster. The active ingredient was trichloroethane. I did about 4 light hits. I felt very heavy and things sounds seemed more intense. That was about it. 

A few days past and later a few of my friends and I grabed the bottle and went outside. This time i did very strong hits and I did 8. The entire world seemed like it was zero gravity and my body was the only thing wieghted down. There was a feeling of slow motion and a few trip like thoughts. It lasted about 15 min. Overall its pretty cool but its probley dangerous like all inhalents.
