I headed into town to pick up some pills and meet some mates. I collected my pills, and headed off for a couple of spliffs with some mates. After this, me, Paul, Joe and Mike headed off to the cinema. I dropped a pill on the way (6pm), and then two more during the film(6:30pm,7:20pm), not really feeling anything by the time we left. Mike, John and Paul dropped a pill (while we went for a spliff) before the film, and Paul dropped again during the film. I had no effects until we got a through town, where the pills started hitting me fairly hard, making me grin like a madman with the normal chattiness, quite intense but not nearly as good as I had hoped, I was quite disappointed. We headed into a carpark building for a spliff we Mike before he left us. We then walked to another mates house, shared a spliff and left, this is where our night really began.

Previously in the night me and Paul had chatted about splitting a gram of Ketamine between us. When we phoned our friend, he told us that he didn't have any Ketamine left, but did have some nice Crystal MDMA powder. We picked up the MDMA and realised that we actually had nowhere to stay for the night, none of us could get home either. We headed back to the carpark where we had a spliff earlier - it was about 4 stories high with a semi underground level, and an enclosed stairwell leading up to the top floors. Each floor had a long row of garages on each side.

The pills must of been wearing off at this point because I remember getting to the carpark at midnight and my memory is much clearer from this point onwards. We sat down in one of the garages to examine our gram, it was a white crystalline powder with the odd small lump of crystal in it. We were pretty pleased as it was definitely a very fat gram. Paul scraped a some MDMA onto a tin lid, and we crushed up and mixed in Johns last pill (a red kangaroo). The resulting mixture was pretty pink.

We were all impressed, and after a few minutes we were all being hit hard. It wasn't long before I was clenching my jaw and gurning, and my eyes were shaking. I felt the euhporic waves flowing over my body with my skin buzzing slightly. We sat and chatted for a bit, and then we all did a bomb. While waiting for the bomb to hit us we decided to do another line. After that I was extremely fucked, gurning, eyes shaking, body feeling amazingly, like I was being gently squeezed from all over.

Paul broke out the nitrous and John told us about something fun his friend suggested to him. We all had a balloon ready, and stood at one end of the long rows of garages. At the other end was a wall of colourful graffiti. We all took some long deep breaths for about a minute or so, and then hit our nitrous balloons. On the signal we all sprinted as fast as we could towards the wall.

The feeling was absolutely phenomenal, I felt like I was running at a thousand miles an hour. As soon as I reached the wall an enormously intense rush of euphoria and adrenaline hit me, like nothing I have honestly felt before. We were all lost in a moment of togetherness, sharing the same feeling and the rush, a connectedness totally above anything I've ever felt on ecstacy, a real feeling of instinctual togetherness. Looking back on the run it seemed like it happened in less than a second.

We repeated the experience a couple of times, feeling even better than the first time. I also noticed that I had brief yet extreme visuals when I reached the wall, comparable to an LSD and Nitrous combination. The wall was so bright, the colours of everything were so vivid. The range of colours seemed much wider as well, I seemed to see many tones of each colour. Even the blacks seemed vivid and bright (not grey or lighter, very black, but they did not seem dark).

I then made a request to sit down and hit the nitrous. Time was a bit of a blur now, I know I did another bomb, and then another line or two, but I'm not sure about the times. I was definately the most fucked at this point with Paul coming a close second and John somewhere near us. Anyway - the nitrous. It hit me harder than ever and took me somewhere I'd never been before, the experience was like a very deep K hole on ketamine, to the point where I actually can't get back to reality, or are even aware of it. I remember a very dark blur, with figures and mistyness, it didn't last long, but I was in so deep. The part I remember well is the coming out, I was still in the darkness but I could start to faintly hear John and Paul talking, growing slowly louder, I then became aware that they were there, and noticed that I was rolling my head from one side of my neck to the other against the wall I was sitting against.

They asked if I was alright. I replied in the positive. I was feeling amazing. I repeated the experience again later and exactly the same thing happened.

At some point later we decided to do a double nitrous balloon run. This was the most intense experience. I was running at breakneck speeds towards the wall. As I got there I experienced hallucinations that are more intense than I've ever even touched on before. Pauls face looked as if it were posterized using a filter on photoshop. Everything was going so slowly, it seemed to be frame by frame. Time almost stood still as I looked at his face. When I faded back into reality I saw Pauls face and could tell he was definately in a state close to mine. John asked him if he was okay, but I knew he was.

We did a couple more nitrous runs that are a big blur. On one run I tripped over hard, and fell into a similar k-hole like state to before, almost unconcious. By the time I was back in reality Paul and John were standing over me asking if I was okay. I had badly grazed my knee and elbow, but the pain soon subsided, almost disappearing later in the night.

At some point we headed up into the stairwell where we snorted more MDMA. We shared some hugs, and I felt a very pronounced uplifting feeling in my chest as we embraced, as I often do on ecstacy. We did a couple more nitrous runs, but we were all so wasted that we no longer felt the nitrous before the run, only the euphoria and rush afterwards, it was losing its magic and we realised that we could get a similar effect running without the nitrous first.

I was now gurning more than ever and my eyes were shaking alot. Paul suddenly expressed concern about the fact that I had only drunk a few beers during the day and nothing else. I told him not to worry, I knew I'd be fine.

The MDMA soon started to run out, and after we'd done our last lines we all started to trip. I was tripping hard, but I find this normal in the time after I've done ecstacy, during my levelling off and comedown periods. I was still peaking however and the bricks on the walls were looking extremely strange. They were no longer bricks, but a vast vertical plane of white-green colour with moving lines travelling across it, my vision was shaking alot at this point, making the visuals even more intense. Paul reported seeing hieroglyphics, and John later also told us this.

There were extremely loud banging noises coming from the ground floor, which made us all start and look around at each other, sharing the alertness and sudden moment of fear, still on the same level. It quickly passed and left us calm and trippy again.

The mood had slowly changed as the night came to a close, we were now sitting tripping, in quiet contemplative states, as opposed to the extreme euphoric energetic chattiness of before. We spent a while chatting and sharing our trippy experiences. I saw the faces of our friends take on elements of bright abstract paintings, eyes turning into dark moving thin black strokes of paint, everything being juggled about slightly. We did our last nitrous, each sitting in the corner of the room, and me and John shared the last line left in the wrap. We all tripped till morning, when we smoked a spliff we'd been saving all night. Paul left us, and me John headed into town, where we shared a mild trippy experience. John remarked on how similar it felt to mushrooms, as we stood and stared at a wall. We walked around a park, staring up at the golden leaves on the trees, and noticing the amazing beauty of the morning sun, casting it's golden light over everything.

As we walked the streets we both shared a feeling of disconnectedness from the rest of the world and society. We weren't normal, we weren't like the people walking past us, we were taking things slowly while they bustled past, only giving eye contact when they were staring at us, because we didn't fit in. Yet.

We headed into some shops to pass some time, walking round the isles without looking at anything, and then heading out, feeling rather foolish and out of place. We sat in a book shop, and in a library. Both quietly staring into space, slightly tripping. There was an understanding of feeling the same experience between us, and we didn't often talk, the silence was comfortable. We were still feeling out of place so we headed back to the garages, where we sat for an hour or so, a few people passing us in the stairwell. Eventually we parted ways as the entire experience ended leaving a calm and tranquil feeling with me until I reached home.
