Damn...that was a crazy first experience! The San pedro was prepared through boiling/straining and was very potent. In addition, the mood of the night was great and all of the people involved were just ready to have some fun...Here is how my first night with mescaline went...

3:00 pm==--I'm at work when my friends stop by and say that they made some San Pedro and that I should eat it.

4:45 pm==--I get off of work and rush home.

5:15 pm==--I left my house and am now at my friends house.

5:30 pm==--I have taken all of the San Pedro. I ended up taking about 12 inches worth although at the time my friends had told me that I had only taken 8 in...I found out later when I started to trip when they told me. I was happy to hear the news...

7:30 pm==--Nothing was really happening except for the fact that for some reason while at burger king (gettin some whoppers and free fries) that I had the largest/goofiest smile on my face and I just felt like laughing! Nothing visual yet, but there was a definate mood lift!

7:45 pm==--On the way back to my friends house we smoked a bowl because my friend said that when he had done San Pedro a week before, they smoked a bowl and it felt like it 'released the mescaline'.

7:50 pm==--Oh shit, that trick works!...something is definately different! I cant tell what though...

8:15 pm==--my two friends and I went to an empty house of some people we knew. My friends were going to try Datura that night.

8:40 pm==--The pebbles in the back yard were now 3D and arranged in octogonal patters. The parallel wood strips above us were also getting 'wavy'.

9:00 pm===--My friends were feeling the effects from the dose of Datura they took. We then decided to watch TV.

9:45 pm==--We take a trip into the backyard again except for now its dark and I'm seriously trippin my brains out. They laid on the Hammock and I went for a stroll around the beautifully gardened back yard. Flowers grabbed ahold of each other and swayed before my eyes, and stars simply looked awesome for some reason!

10:15 pm==--We're at the skatepark that we used to go to fairly often... and I AM VERY INTRIGUED!! My vision was 3D..not like the regular 3D that you see right now, but the most 3D PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE. The leaves on the ground formed tesselations then sprouted up in my direction. IT WAS COOOL. VERY cool.

11:00 pm==--Damn, bricks are great. Not only can they change color, but they can decay and rebuild in seconds too! Oh yeah, the sofas and carpet can change color as well!

11:30 pm==--I check in at home, and my friend and I sit out front talking for 2 hours as I START to come down from my trip.

1:30 am==--I go inside the house and go to bed. My cieling had crazy patterns in volving beads and the pattern on my bedspread was 3D (but not as much as it would have been earlier).

3:00 am==--I'm still up hallucinating (this drug lasts a long time)

5:00 am==--Off and on sleep.

8:00 am==--wake up. vision normal. feel normal. act normal. My body felt drained though..I think it was just out of energy from lack of sleep though.

FINAL THOUGHTS: Definately worth a try. I know that I will for sure do it again. You know how when your stoned, your brain feels stupid? well, not on mescaline. Visually, your stunned and put in awe. Emotionally, you feel uplifted. And intellectually, you feel normal (except for when it comes time to find words to describe what you are seeing of course!)

Just one more paragraph and I'm done. :) When you are going to take San Pedro/mescaline, make sure you are in the right frame of mind. If you are VERY unsure about it, you will most likely not enjoy it as much as you can. Make sure you really want it before you actually do it. Thanks for reading, c ya!
