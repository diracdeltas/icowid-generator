I am a 17 year old male, living in , nm.My friend KILLMORE and I both ingested 9 mg of 5-meo-AMT on 4/1/05.

It came on very slowly, it was about an hour and forty five minutes before we both agreed that it was taking effect. For both of us this would be our second 5-meo-AMT experience.

The rest of the night was a low plateu sort of high, not at all like my first experience with the chemical which was a smaller dose of 6 mg. 5-meo-AMT makes me feel an outward pressure from the inside of my skull. My eyes felt twice their normal size and any sort of lights gave me a splitting headache.

Me and KILLMORE'S experience w/ 5-meo-AMT more than a month earlier was Extatic; visuals similar to LSD accompanied by a head/body high that could be likened to Oxycontin or other synthetic opiates.

I believe that the difference in experiences were due to environment and dosage changes. The first ingestion was just killmore and me; introverted from the rest of the world, the two of us. The second experience was in a party setting w/ lots of kids getting drunk and loud.

5-meo-AMT lasts for about 20-30 hours on a dose of above 6 mg (depending on body weight between us).<!--DO NOT ingest more than 14 mg! And be prepared to -->This made me question mu sanity, sanctity, safetey, and driving abilities.
