I have been taking Melatonin for about 6 months now and I started taking it because I would lie in bed for about an hour to an hour and a half.  My doctor recommended it to me and he first recommended I take 9 mg 20 minutes before I go to bed, but after a while I started taking 6 mg then that wasn't working, so I decided to take 12 and then just recently saw that same doctor and he said that 12 was perfect for me right now and I have never slept better in my life.
