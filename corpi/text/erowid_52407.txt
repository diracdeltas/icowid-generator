It was the long easter weekend, and we didn't have school till Tuesday. I was extremely bored in general, the weather outside was crappy since it was spring and I hadn't done much in a while. We had Friday off, so all Friday I slept, and then Friday night went to a movie with some friends. Two were coming over after the movie, I'll call them Franklin and Jim. I asked them what they wanted to be called, they came up with the stupid names. I knew since the time I woke up that day that all I wanted to do was try some drugs. I've never smoked pot or anything, and I was planning on a gram of shrooms, but I couldn't get any. The only thing I knew I could get was catnip. Before the whole thing I had drank 2 bottles of BAWLS, an extremely potent slow release energy drink. I also drank a few cups of blackberry tea throughout the night, which also has caffeine. Here's what happened:

At 2:00, we went for a walk around my subdivision, each smoking a joint of the stuff. The smoke was nasty, very harsh and tasted really bad. I doubt the catnip we had was 100%, nor organicly grown. I smoked a little bit of a second joint, but not much. The second joint had some mint tea mixed in, which made the smoke better, but still not too appealing. I'd reccommend a bong or water pipe for this. Anyway, halfway through our walk, Jim noticed a weird shape around a streetlight. He then said it had quickly disappeared. I was feeling a little light, and we all noted some odd feelings, but nothing intense.

At 2:10, we got back to my house. Franklin and I drank some tea that I had started brewing before our walk, made with catnip in a coffee filter. The tea didn't taste too bad, but we still tasted the smoke, so we all got drinks.

At 2:20 I noted some weird feelings. All I have written down on my paper is: I feel odd. All I remember feeling was light headed and a little relaxed, which could be placebo.

2:25, Franklin and I felt some strange feelings. For a very brief amount of time it felt like my vision was breathing, kinda closing and expanding. VERY brief, though.

At 2:35, Jim says his arm feels numb. He hasn't even started the tea I made for him at 2:00. I felt kinda odd and relaxed, and I stared at a bottle for a little while. I also felt sleepy very suddenly, like a yawn that didn't come. The feeling passed.

2:45, Jim and I feel sleepy. I play solitaire. Franklin is shooting staples all over the room, and taping the blades of my scissors together. Jim says his arm feels tingly again, and Franklin starts stapling the necks of some animal stickers. The feeling isn't very strong at all, we're just not very mature to begin with.

2:55, Franklin and I drink a cup of tea that's been brewing since we finished our last ones. We reused the homemade tea bags.

3:25 is the next time I have written down, and I recorded that Franklin and I were laughing at stupid card tricks, because we both knew no impressive ones at all. Jim was using the computer. I fell when running up the stairs to get drinks. I'm not that coordinated.

4:00, some mild effects, light headedness. I'm sure you could get those from smoking just about anything. Franklin goes home because he lives across the street.

4:30, Jim and I go to bed. I know I won't sleep because I drank so much caffeine.

4:45 - 5:00, while in bed, I experienced some twittering of my clock in my perefrial vision. It looked kinda tilted and distorted when I looked straight at it. This could be because I was tired and couldn't fall asleep.

5:00 I began listening to a Shpongle cd, because white noise sometimes help me sleep. Also, I was bored.

5:00 - 5:30 I felt some minor headaches that passed very quickly. Still can't sleep, too much caffeine.

6:00 Completely baseline (not that I ever REALLY left), I light some incense in my room, which is probably a bad idea, since my parents probably wouldn't be cool with that.

Conclusion: I definitely documented this a bit excessively for something as mild as catnip, but what the hell. I think I'd like to read a report like this, even if it was just to laugh at the kids who smoked catnip. All in all the night was kinda fun, but I dunno if the catnip helped at all.
