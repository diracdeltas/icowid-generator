Fun First Times

My friend came to me one day with a substance called 5MeO-AMT for a very reasonable price. It was a first time for both me and him, and we had a group of friends come over and we tried it together. After about 45-60 minutes I started feeling mild nausea and restlesness. 

My friend got started vomiting about 30 minutes after we took the pills, but we blamed the sickness on the combination of new drugs and taco bell, since he felt much better afterwards.  After about an hour we put in Pink Floyd's The Wall and started smoking. The room seemed breathe and bend around me, similar to effects I've had on LSD and Mushrooms. Music was very invigorating and seemed to affect my mood in extreme ways. However, the trip seemed to come in waves, with intense visual hallucinations one moment then being seemingly sober the next. All in all I tripped for about 5-6 hours, and was left with a horrible headache for a few hours after. Apart from the excruciating headache, I think it was 5 dollars well spent and would love to try it again.
