I am a counseling psychologist [Phd]. I started my first weekend on meth after partying Friday, and staying up all night. I started Saturday at about noon. The first line didn't have much of an effect (snorted), except waking me up a bit, so I had another one about an hour later. What would have been an extremely tiring/sleepy day of boring work, turned into a lively upbeat afternoon. I got more work done that I would have otherwise, and soon left with my friends to hang out. At about 5 I had another, slightly larger, line and had one every 3 hours or so, when the effects started to wear off. 

I was very awake during this time, but noticed slight dehydration. (I suspect due to faster metabolism) I noticed no bad side effects at this time, except for maybe tingling skin and scalp (but I rather enjoyed the tingling :)

That night, I continued with my standard lines, in addition to beer, and occasionally smoking a small portion of meth using the tin foil boat method. Being drunk on meth was a great experience (until I sobered up) I had the pleasant effects of alcohol (even more talkative and open) as well a generally really happy/warm feeling the strangest thing was that while my body was drunk, it seemed my mind was working very clearly, though I noted increased emotionality. I even fixed a problem with my friend's computer that would have normally given me problems.

I noticed that smoked meth hits much quicker, lacks the burning nose sinuses, and the run of bitter mucus down my throat.

The bad thing was that while on meth, I couldn't use the way I was thinking to accurately judge how much I had been drinking, and coupled with the invincibility, I think I drank a bit too much, though I did not pass out or through up, I experienced a hangover after I sobered up and despite being sped up, the alcohol seemed to take a longer time to get out of my system, both while drunk, and the hangover as well.

Throughout the entire experience, I had absolutely no desire to eat, and I had to force myself to drink (water) due to being dehydrated.

The next day (judged by when the sun came up about 6am Sunday) we all had another line, and smoked a little bit using the tin boat method. We then went to work (house to house repair work).

Working with some of my friends, only one of which actually is getting paid to work, we're just all going together to chill.

I could start to tell my body was getting tired after being up 50 hours or so. The energy effects of the meth lasted shorter and shorter periods, and most of it was feeling like I would on a day after normal sleep. We had been taking doses in shorter and shorter intervals, by sunday evening we would snort lines every hour to a hour and a half. 

At this time, I believe the nausea from drinking, in combination to the mucus/meth mix (from swallowed drainage) and lack of food, caused some nausea and upset stomach, of various intensity, but never bad enough to throw up (nothing TO throw up, really) which made the tail end of the trip much less comfortable(as a solution to this, I determined to force myself to eat at least a small amount of food, and not to drink much, if at all the next time. my last experiment, following those methods, and smoking exclusively with no snorting yielded no nausea, and only a slight upset stomach after too long a period without eating.)

Towards the end of sunday, I had started to halucinate, due to lack of sleep, and paranoia became noticeable, I would see shadows and expect someone to be there type of thing, or just plain hear voices. By the time for my trip home, I had had the last of my meth (following my own suggestion above) and was hallucinating. I believe my prior experience with LSD, morning glory, and shrooms, but especially LSD heightened the effects of the hallucinations, by the time I got home at about 11 pm, I sat around unable to sleep, and I experienced much the same visual effects of LSD. I finally drank a herbal tea to help me sleep at 2, and fell asleep (though very light) for about 12-14 hours. 

Monday was spent resting, as my body recovered from the wear and tear my body took. I REALLY wanted more meth so that I wouldn't feel the crashing effects. But being an 45 mins from my friends, and having none of my own, and no ready source to get it from, I crashed successfully. cravings the 'crash' day are not as bad as before I slept, and they continue occasionally. They however were nowhere near as bad for me as a nicotine craving.

(Another bad effect, I smoked 3 1/2 packs on sat and sun, much more than my usual 1/2 a pack a day. thus I experienced some coughing.)

I also experienced some chest pains when I got overly excited at the very end of my trip, and the next day, but they were not severe (poor heart).

I am currently trying to deduce the psychological effects of the meth on myself and my friends. I have noticed a wide range of effects, depending on the stress, and normal outlook of the person.
