This was during a very bad time in my life.  I was a hardcore meth addict, injecting often and in large quantities.  Basically, I know now that I was attempting to kill myself indirectly through drug use on a regular basis.  I could not stand life and felt that all existance was ugly.  I was out of meth at the time with the exception of maybe some scrapings.  The details are rather fuzzy at best.

I was down to the last of the bag one day, washing cottons for the last bit of dope I could get out of them.  I was disappointed at the amount I had and had put too much water in.  I had a bottle of Seagram's Seven and decided to put a drop in with the rest.  I did this by dipping my finger in the booze pulling out a small amount suspended from the tip.  Touching it to the water in the spoon, I mixed it with the watery dope.  It was all very unsanitary.  I then was distracted; strange as it may seem I left this in the spoon about four hours, while dealing with my girlfriend/partner, who was flipping out over something or another. When I got back to it I decided to put another drop in.  I then injected it.

Instant black out.  I had been up for days and I have never tried to figure out if this was enough alcohol to achieve anything, but I was out.  Three days straight and the girl took care of me.  I don't remember anything about the experience, only that I always thought it was incredibly stupid to have done something like that.
