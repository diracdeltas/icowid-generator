Ultram is great, it is a very pleasant drug, and almost feels like cocaine without the paranoia. It removed all anxiety, body aches, and pains. I enjoy taking one 50 mg pill at a time, but for a more enjoyable time I take three (150 mg). Ultram is said to be highly addictive, but had no major side effects for me when taking the drug. 

Taking Ultram consistantly for long periods of time may produce withdrawls much like heroin. (runny nose, dialated pupils, insomnia, etc.) As long as it is taken only on occasion it is great, and withdraws are not as likely. It is not a good idea to mix with alcohol, I puked all night, and I have a strong stomach. This is not a narcotic, but very much acts like one. Be safe...
