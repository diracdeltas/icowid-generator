It all started off as a fun thing that the 'group' did together. We'd buy an 8Ball which is usually 3.7 grams of cocaine. We'd do it and mix it with alcohol and just have fun when we were together. That lasted for about a month. Then, the whole group broke apart because people had become sneaky-stealing coke and money from each other. People that I had always believed were your friends were stealing from me. So then, after the breakup, it became just 4 of us. We'd buy an 8-ball or more everyday. I was still in school, but the 4.0 I had always had was gone. I was failing most of my classes, I dropped 30 pounds. I looked disgusting. But back then, I thought I looked good. I didn't really realize what I was getting myself into when I started to do coke...I could sit here for hours and just tell you the amazing experiences that I've had. I didn't really realize that I had an addiction, because I was the strongest of the 4. I never 'fiend' for it. But I was always there when we did it. It's sad in a way, the way people let themselves change so much, be so unhappy with themselves but they continue to do it. I was diagnosed with Mono, Bipolar, and put in the hospital. That's finally when I stopped and thought. My health is more important than my fun. Now I'm a recovering addict, and I've been clean for 2 months. My 3 other friends have each done it other times. I guess I really was the only strong one.
