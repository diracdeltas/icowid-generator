Hello All.

Being the skeptic that I'am, I did'nt really believe that 5-HTP helped with an MDMA experiance.

Well here's my story.

It WORKED wonders for someone who has E'd a lot.  It was almost like the first time with considerably less side effects.

I took about 1000mg. of 5-HTP about 1.5 hours before I dropped.  It was a LOT slower coming on but it was WELL worth the wait..  Try it, You'll LOVE it.
