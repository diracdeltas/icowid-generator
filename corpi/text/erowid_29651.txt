This was my experience with a quantity of 2mg xanax bars:

9:15 - popped 1.25 bars (2.50mg)

9:50 - feeling light headed and a little 'woozy' for lack of a better term. My head is starting to sway

10:00- popped 3/4 of a bar (another 1.5mg)

10:15- dizziness and disorientation when I move fast, slight euprhoria

10:20- had convo w/ parents w/o any trouble. Slightly hard to walk, moving my head fast disorientsn and blurrs my vision, images melt together

10:45- extremely careless and feeling very much as if stoned, but w/ greater sense of euphoria and less confusion. Unwisely crush .5mg and snort it

10:50- the last 1.5mg I popped is kicking in, cant think, walking is very difficult. Drink two shots of vodka and snort another 1.5mg

11:00- laughing hysterically at Futurama

Totals - 4mg ingested, 2mg snorted

After that everything blacked out completely. Not even the slightest memories persist. 

4:00? - 6:00? Was told in morning that I was walking around the house for hours and didnt respond to anyone. Sometime and somehow I recieved a minor cut which bled the fuck everywhere and got me in trouble for the mess. I passed it off as sleepwalking.

No more xanax.
