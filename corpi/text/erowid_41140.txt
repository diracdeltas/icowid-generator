I've only been a habitual user of cocaine for a few months.  However, it has gotten the best of me.  While I will not go to great lengths to find it, if it is around I cannot help doing it no matter the number of ways in which it is an unwise choice.  And once I start doing it I can't stop until some responsibility or exhausted monies forces me to.  I cry the next day, feel like shit the day after that, and on the next day feel like theres still something to live for.  But I still crave it.  I have dreams, where I am doing it, loving it.  SO vivid, the high is so real, and they always end w/ me saving some for the next day. I wake up excited, only to realize there was never any cocaine and I had dreamt it all. I get depressed at this.  It's similar in real life, however; no matter how much one starts out with, one will never save some for the next day.  I am a student at one of the county's most prestigious schools, having earned their premier scholarship, and now have lost it and most recently have earned a 1.75 GPA, including one failed class. The fact that one is spotlighted to succeed and be something special is VERY revocable.<!-- so please be careful if you value your happiness and well being.-->
