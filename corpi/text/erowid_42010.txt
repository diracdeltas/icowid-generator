Ciao.

GHB is one of the most wonderfull substances i았e ever tried. The euphoria it produces beats just about anything that i았e tried. The effects can be described as being drunk, but without any hangover and more of a happy feeling to it. Dosage is the key - and not mixing it with other drugs. I았e seen friends pass out while mixing with alcohol and benzodiazepines.  I have to be carefull to enjoy this substance. I start out slowly and build up my 'dose'. The stuff I have now is diluted in some form cause I need 5,5ml to get optimal effects where I used to need about 2-3 ml back in 2000. Have앑t got my hands on it since - but now when i았e done it again I just can앖 help but love the stuff. To avoid bad reactions I follow these guidelines:

1.Don앖 mix with other drugs, pharms or alcohol
2.If I dont feel effects within an hour, I take half the dose I started with and wait another hour. Sometimes it hits me in 5 min and at other times it takes up to 45 min.
3.When I know my dose, I stay there and only try 1ml more or less than that for a milder or stronger buzz. More will make me pass out.
4.Don앖 use it all the time. It takes about 3 hours for it to leave my body. I let some time pass after this before I do any more

I았e found no bad effects from taking it once to twice aday but have seen people go through horrible withdrawals from using it every hour for a weeks in row.
