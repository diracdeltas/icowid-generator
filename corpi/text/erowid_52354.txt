Wow, this day was off the hook.  I've been poppin pills since I was 12.  At 14 I turned to heroin, easier to find and cheaper.  Anyways,  this night I scored 3 clonazepam then 15 mins later found a connect on 6 .5 xanax. I was poppin them fuckers all at the same time.  I was fine until they kicked in then I was fallin on my knees at my house, couldnt keep my eyes open and when my dad realized what was goin on I went to the hospital.

Apperently I drank charcoal, an iv, and a cathider u know where haha luckily I dont remember anything.  <!--My advice to all you people hooked on any drug is to think--> I should have thought about what would my family would go through even though I didn't care they all did.  I've been in the hospital 5 times in teh last couple months and thats a shitty life to live.
