I was bored the other night, I decided I was going to finally try some Benadryl. I read as much about it as I could and got some experiences from people I knew. But none of that reading and experience stories could prepare me for the journey I was about to embark on.

It started at about 10:40PM. I took 10 25mg tablets. I sat here for a while, while someone I was talking to told me what I was about to experience over AIM, and to remember to stay calm and in control. While this was going on, I was getting a weird feeling. Almost like I was floating. Everything also started getting foggy. I decided to go back to my room and lay down. I started reading where I left off in The De Vinci Code, but it did me no good. I can't remember what I read. I do however remember the words were enshrouded in this fog I was experiencing. Within minutes the words were starting to move around. This was at about 11:15.

The words were moving, and started to form new words, asking me questions and stuff. Being in the state I was in, I answered. I sat there for at least 15 minutes, immersed in conversation with a book, as the words kept changing every time I said something.

From about 11 up until when I started talking to the book, I was hearing faint, random sounds. Things like wind chimes and footsteps. Nothing more than that until a little later.

After the conversation ended I decided I wanted to listen to Aphex Twin. I got up and walked out to where the computer is to get my iPod. My legs felt like lead, yet oddly like they were floating at the same time. It felt more like I was floating than actually walking. I got out here and saw my iPod sittng right here next to the moniter. I saw it, but I could have sworn I didn't even know I had an iPod. I was staring right at it, but it didn't register in my head that it was there. Feeling defeated I walked back to my room and laid down again.

Here's where things start to get freaky and blank spots happen. I lay down and look at the ceiling fan. It's moving, but I don't feel any air. Then I remember that it's turned off. It was slowly spinning in one direction, and then it would reverse. I looked over and noticed a glass of water on my nightstand. I don't ever remember getting water, but all of a sudden I was thirsty as hell, so I grabbed it and took a drink. It felt like I was swallowing liquid nitrogen. The water felt so extremely cold. Swallowing also felt like trying to force an elephant through a keyhole.

Out of the corner of my eye I saw a person standing by my door, and I heard my friend say my name. I turned to look but there was no one there. But to my surprise, the wall was moving. It was almost like it was rythmicly breathing. In, out. In, out. I sat there and watched this for a minute or 2 while an immense feeling of euphoria spread over me. I was hallucinating! I just sat there and watched the walls breathe and tried to time my breathing to coincide with the wall's. After about 5 minutes of this, things started going sour. I had rapid mood changes. Hapiness, anger, sadness, euphoria. Boom boom boom boom, like that.

I went back to looking at the wall, and noticed that the breathing had changed. It wasn't the same peaceful, rythmic breathing, but instead an ominous, angry breathing. At this point I started hearing voices. the walls stopped breathing and started morphing all around. Swirling and dripping. Some even started bleeding. I sat there curled in a ball, with a massive feeling of anticipation, like waiting for the world to fall down onto me. At about this time, the wall at the back of my closet, which is directly in front of my bed, reached out at me. When this happened a HUGE wave of dread and fear just swept over my body and just carried all of my concious thoughts away. I was laying there, scared for my life while the walls were reaching out for me.

Then I remembered what the LLer told me. Just remember that I'm in control of everything. It's just my mind and it's not real. After a while I forced the walls back to somewhat normal. They were still breathing, but it didn't freak me out as much as before.

I decided to turn my lamp off and try to go to sleep. I lay there, staring at the ceiling. It was 1:05AM. A heavy fog filled my vision and I lay there. I don't even remember falling asleep, or if I even DID sleep. The hallucinations and the dreaming blended right into each other perfectly. I was just laying there staring into the fog. After what seemed like 10-15 minutes, the fog cleared. I looked at my clock and it was 10AM. I got up, feeling lightheaded.

Afterwards, I felt kinda lightheaded, and I had this feeling in my chest and arms that I can only describe as 'fun'. My hands felt like they're disconnected and just floating. I felt kinda disassociated from my body too, but only a little. The lightheadedness also felt kinda like a spinning feeling. I guess this is the afterglow/hangover part.

Looking back on when I started hallucinating the wall movement, I can't really tell if I was asleep and dreaming or not. The hallucinations and the dream went so perfectly together that If I tried right now, I wouldn't be able to differentiate the two. All in all it wasn't too bad of an experience. I've heard people say that it isn't at all enjoyable, but for me, I actually thought it was pretty enjoyable.
