My experience with Klonopin(clonazepam)

I have been having anxiety recently and was given an RX for this drug.

I mostly experienced my panic attacks/anxiety when I was smoking weed but I let that go unsaid when I visited the Dr.

Now that you know how I got the drugs I can tell you what they did to me.

I took four .5mg's by mouth and felt the effects within 20 minutes.

A total feeling of calm came over me. I didn't have a care in the world. Much like some good weed without the paranoia is how I would describe it.

I just chilled on the couch listening to music.I didn't want to get up for anything or even talk,just relax listening to my music.

This lasted for around 4-5 hours until I ended up falling asleep.

Good experience. I may have found a 'legal' substitute for weed.
