I boiled the 6g of kratom resin until dissolved in 100ml of water then added it to my cup of coffee. I used coffee instead of tea as I thought it would cover the bitter taste even with 4 teaspoons of sugar it still tasted revolting. I decided to drink a mouthful and then sip some orange juice to take the taste away. (the taste is enough to make me vomit).

About 5 mins after I began to feel mildly drunk and numb and a bit monged as if I had smoked too much weed. This feeling lasted for about 3 hours and then started to taper off for about 3 hours. I definatly would try this again but increase the dosage. I havent tried any opioids before so I dont no what it feels like but I definatly felt numbed. This was my first time of trying it and I bought it off an online vendor.
