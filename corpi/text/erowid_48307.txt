I live in Johannesburg, South Africa. In late September (spring) Woodstock is held. This was to be South Africa's seventh Woodstock and my first. The festival lasts over 4 days and showcases not only South Africa's best bands, but also hip hop acts along with the best funky house in the world. My friends and I arrived on the Wednesday, and tripped our balls off, but the story I'm going to tell you is about the Friday night.

By this time, I was already thouroghly familiar with the venue, and having tripped there on the Wednesday night, and having gotten horribly drunk and shroomd out on the Thursday, I was confident about exploring the place in altered mind states. Not to mention, I was very happy as all of my buddies (including our 'chemist') had arrived that afternoon. I was filled with anticipation, knowing that Friday night was undoubtably going to be the biggest party out of all four nights, filled with sheer joy at having just seen my favorite band play. All in all, by the time my mates and I clambered into our tent and dropped our first paper, I was feeling all round content with my situation.

Some time later I find myself wondering around with some of my friends taking a look at the seemingly completely-different-from-this-morning stalls of people selling shirts, bongs, pappers, etc. The acid is stating to take effect. I find my buddys j and B searching the car for a gram of kat that j has misplaced. After about half an hour of futile searching and staunch denial that I stole it (I really didn't) I decide to leave as the vibrations in by this car aren't great.

My tripping buddies and I decide to go back to our tent for more acid. We decide to roll a spliff before dropping our paper. While rolling, we are joined by another of my friends partial to a bit of lsd, and my innocent friend from college, lets call him s. Upon learning that the little pieces of paper we are putting into our mouths is acid, S shows great surprise and bails from the tent. This sends the rest of us into laughing fits as we smoke the joint and eat our second dose of acid.

Exiting the tent, I feel the familiar sense of anticipation in my chest and stomach which my mates have termed 'acid tummy', the more the acid tummy, the more intense the trip. Woodstock is looking like a completely different place right now. We hook up with this really cool chick, n, who missions with us. Halfway to the stage to see the bands, the visuals were pretty cool, the people around me were all faceless, individuals blurring into a indistinguishable mass of people nowhere near my level. The difference between light and shadow was becoming less distinct. Coloured lights were all moving around changing colours.

The band playing at the main stage is shite so we move off to a more quiet area away from all the lights and people. On the way, I notice that the ground is incredibly soft and squishy, like walking on sponge. It also becomes apparent to me that the entire world, no the universe! No, the very entirety of reality itself is completely made up of wavelengths. And that only I can move in the magical way that lets me ride them. Amazing! How could I have made it to the age of 19 without noticing this?

I decide to think about that later as I now have an amazing view of the stars. We lie on our backs, staring at the stars. Woodstock 7 was held out in the country, well away from any citys, so the sky is remarkably clear. Every star is a different colour. They move and dance with each other, they fire magical muticoloured beams of light at one another, which I feel compelled to provide sound effects for.

I am filled with even more anticipation, and my acid tummy is getting more intense meaning that the trip has hardly started. I find myself laughing hysterically, while feeling utterly content. We decide to drop a pill (ecstasy).

Walking back to our tent, which is at the center of everything, I start thinking more in-depth about the wavelengths. If I move up and down while making a strange noise while walking along this insanely spongy ground, I find I can actually go BETWEEN the wavelengths. Interesting, upon getting back to the campsite I find all my buddys sitting in a loose circle in between the tents, talking, drinking and smoking. None of the conversations sound interesting, so I content myself by sitting on the ground and making sound effects for the muticoloured coulours that I can shoot out my fingertips. I am glad to find my buddy j has found his gram and consumed half of it in celebration, along with two of the biggest ex pills I have ever seen. j is so shmangled that he keeps losing his wallet or his bag. He loses one then finds it, only to lose the other. He repeats the process over and over. The funny thing is that he is sitting in one place constantly losing his bag then his wallet, his wallet then his bag. And even funnier, there is nothing in the wallet, and he keeps his wallet in his bag. Very amusing.

The x is starting to really hit hard. I can't stay here, mumbling to myself and laughing at J, I must dance. So myself, N, and my tripping mates, along with this girl Candy who is awesome to party with, head down to the pools, where the funky house is playing. Sucking contentedly on a sucker, I find myself in an incredibly psychadelic place, filled with funky house and flowing neon colours. Even my sucker glows! despite rushing my tits off cos of the ex, I am completely unable to dance so I decide to chill by the psychadelic pool, as the atmosphere is chilled and quite inviting, reminding me vaguely of the carribean.

My mates want to move on though, and explore this strange alternate Woodstock we have found ourselves in. We climb to the top of the water slide and once again marvel at the amazing power of the stars. The top of the slide gives us an amazing view of most of the venue, mainly the main stage. The absolute euphoria I feel must be drug induced, but I don't care. This is the most spiritual, perfect experience ever. I try telling this to my friends, but find that I am without words to explain what I am feeling, its fine, they seem caught up in their own crazy thoughts.

Upon going back to the main stage, I find that the ground is not only more spongy, but it now sticks to my feet. Laughing, I slip in between the wavelengths, staring at the amazing laser show from the main stage and thinking how my least favorite band which is playing at this time, isn't all that bad, in fact they the best!! I love them! To get a better view of what is now the greatest band of all time, we climb to the top of the halfpipe in the skatepark.

While sitting there, smoking joints and flying amongst the stars, we notice some dude, sitting on his 80cc motorbike, in the halfpipe. We start shouting for him to ride the halfpipe and, drunk and full of confidence, he starts riding up and down the halpipe gradualy getting higher and higher, until he jumps off the bike and lets it fall to the ground. He repeats this process, making his bike do backflips, frontflips, he even jumps it over the funbox, nearly killing two people who got out of the way just in time. He does this again and again, gradualy fucking the bike up until there is no possble way it will start, let alone be rideable, and yet he still carries on. Eventualy, the bike is nearly in two seperate halves, both wheels are square and the fuel tank is ruptured.

At this point, some one from the massive crowd this drunk madness has caused hands the lengendry drunk rider a bottle of brandy. He takes a swig and then pours some into the engine, and, impossible though it may seem, he starts it and does it all again to the massive aplause of the crowd. I have no explanation for this except that crazy things happen when I trip. I would also like to add that this is the funniest thing I have ever seen and I doubt I will ever see anything funnier in all my days. I was surprised to walk away from the skatepark and find that I was still alive, and I had not died laughing.

We rode out the rest of the trip missioning around alot before deciding to go back to the tent and comedown. We smoked lots of joints and got to sleep at about 8 in the morning.

One of the best nights of my life.
