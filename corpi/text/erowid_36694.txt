My problem is paranoia. Iv been an avid pot smoker for 12years, and psychosis had been concreted in- I was convinced that all anyone else did was talk behind my back. I became isolated and withdrawn- I didnt feel part of the human race and had a permanent scowl. I was prescribed Effexor for depression and anxiety attacks. The first 2-3 weeks are awful- Tired but cant sleep for more than 3 hours at a time, feeling powerless and pathetic, nauseus and cold.

 This is a year on, and I actually TRY to make myself paranoid- to put myself in situations that wouldve turned me into a chattering wreck before. I still get a twinge of nervous butterflies in the stomach sometimes- a feeling of dread just before big social occasions, but once Im there, chatting, smiling, drinking or whatever- There is no paranoia at all. The butterflies are me anticipating being paranoid- They havnt gone away. Yet.
