My local headshop sells along with its amazing collection of glass pipes, various 'legal' herbal extracts and blends. Most notably, Salvia. A couple week's prior to the incident which warranted this report; I had purchased a gram of 10x extract, with the direction to 'sprinkle it on top of your herb'. I introduced salvia to my friends that night and asked them if they wanted to try it; of course the answer was yes, we smoked three or four bowls with salvia extract on top. Things seemed sparkly, kind of like shrooms in a way, but only lasted about 5 minutes. I felt pretty cheated having paid around 20 dollars for this gram of extract.

A week or two later I was in my headshop again and told the owner, whom I used to be quite cool with, about how I thought his sh*t was overpriced and bunk. His immediate response; 'Well man, did u smoke it outa a water pipe or just your piece?' I admitted that I'd smoked out of my piece. He insisted I take an in store sample. He pulled out a bong from under the counter, loaded it up with a large hit of 10x, he told me to hit it as hard as I could and hold it. I easily complied with this order, it tasted like a tire on the way out. I felt light headed followed by a feeling like I was swimming through the air, I waved my arms around and marveled at this experience.

I started walking towards the counter when all of a sudden gravity decided it was time to remind me of it's fundamental principals. I stumbled, and before I hit the ground 'reality' as I know it disapeared. I had become part of a wall of faces that I understood to be the 'lego layers' of hell time. I was attached to this wall, by most notably my mouth, which seemed to be stuck in the open position. Women's voices repeated 'It's ok Alex, it's ok Alex.' Things did not seems ok at all. I tried to speak but couldn't, finding that my mouth was part of this wall, then a large deep mans voice screamed from somewhere close to the wall; 'WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO STOP!!!??' I was scared sh*tless, It was around then that the faces above me started pounding. Or landing, I'm not sure, on my head. 

Then gradually I started coming back into the shop, I slowly turned my head to see the head shop dude, who looked like a lego pirate man, staring at me. My first words were; 'When can I leave?' which came out sounding like I had down-syndrome. His response 'It's only been about twenty minutes'. I then realized that my head was in my girlfriends lap, and she was gently caressing my hair. Which accounts for the falling faces on my head. I moved into a sitting position and sat there for about 10 minutes, dazed at what had just happened to me. I then decided that a cigarette was extremely nesesary, and stumbled out the door.

I hop'd into my car and turned on the radio, my girlfriend jumped into the seat next to me. It was cold in the car and I was wearing a t-shirt, I slipped the arm not holding the cigarette into my shirt. A minute later I had forgottin this and thought I had lost an arm somehow. It was around then my girlfriend (half crying) told me what actually happened on the outside world. She said I looked like I was having fun till I turned towards the counter, where she said she could see that I looked like 'a scared animal', she said I then fell over with my mouth and eyes as wide open as possible, and started drooling and twitching, she said she thought I was going to die. I had to agree with her that indeed for about 20 minutes I was pretty sure that that was exactly what HAD happened. 

It took about 40 minutes in the cold car and 3 cigarettes before I could bring myself to drive us home. I am extremely experienced with drugs. You name it, shrooms, coke, x, acid, of course weed and a few others. After this happened to me, my bowls were all given to grateful friends, and I have been sober ever since. This is not just mind altering it's life altering. I am damaged and will never be the same.
