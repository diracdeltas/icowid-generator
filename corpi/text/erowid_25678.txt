Ambien is something that i have tried many times and would always get weird side effects and think nothing of it. Probably because Ambien didnt make me fall asleep easily I would always take alot of it, and almost everytime, i would feel very strange and think i was there were other people around and I would often find myself leaving my bed and doing strange things and it was impossible for me to think straight and i couldnt possibly have a conversation with anyone that made sense.

I didnt think much of it until one day when i did so much i thought i was in my backyard and i was going to build a treehouse or something, only then did i know I was trippin mass. I didn't know that i even was tripping cuz ive never done acid or shrooms, until i read an article in the new yorker about recreational pills and how people do the same thing to trip. I also heard that it works best when you don't drink caffiene with it, something i always did. Unfortunately i couldn't get any for months until this week and i tried it without caffeine and got a much more relaxed feeling, kinda like being stoned but still followed by nightlong tripping. I think the stuff is great now and it works alot like xanax or klonopin except the tripping out part. I've tried many pills and ambien is def in the top 5 on my list.
