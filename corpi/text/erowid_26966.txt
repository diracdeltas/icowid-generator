I was in Mexico with a buddy of mine, and we wanted to have some fun. We had done blow, had a QP of schwag, and an interesting idea came across my mind while searching for some T3's to knock me out one night after doing lines. I saw Effexor, and promptly took 2 75mg caps and put them in my pocket.

Later that night, we went to a 'cafe' as they called it, which was essentially a bar/restaurante w/ a dance floor and a quality sound system. We had a few beers and I told him about the effexor, we both promptly took them, had a few more beers and I felt great! I felt like I was on ecstacy, sort of. Less tingley and connective tho.

Now, drinking with medication isn't healthy, and I'm assuming its horrible for your liver.
