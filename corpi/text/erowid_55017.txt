I am currently withdrawing from dextroamphetamine, and used 3 herbal pills of guarana before a mushroomhead concert.  I felt awake, uninhibited, ecstatic, and horny as hell. Now I know why it's used in herbal ecstacy!!!

If I take too much I feel sick, get a terrible headache, and suffer from insomnia. It also seems to relieve muscle cramps, and does fight fatigue (like the bottle I have claims).
