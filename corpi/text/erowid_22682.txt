Contrary to what one report on here read (a female who took 200 mg), Niacin does work effectively IN THE CORRECT AMOUNT.

The flushing effect is not a side-effect, that's exactly how it does what it needs to do.. which is to move the toxins out of the cells and excrete them through the sweat function.. the redness of the skin and burning feeling is the success of the Niacin moving the acid out of your system..  The problem experienced by the female was that she did FAR too much Niacin for her body weight and amount of LSD..  Logic here.

(Don't ask a doctor to describe the function of an OTC drug as to relating to a prohibited substance... they just aren't gonna know.)

Let's compare my experience to hers..

Me:
7 hits acid in 170 lb body =  40ng / pound.
60 mg Niacin effectively treated .40ng / lb.

Her:
1 hit acid in 120 lb body =  8ng/lb.  
200 mG Niacin was total overkill for 8ng/lb...  

Being that I had 5x the amount of acid taken, and she took 333% more Niacin than I did, that means she actually took 16x the appropriate level of Niacin to have an experience more closely matching mine (the redness was there, and itching, but it wasn't swelling, or doctor visits, and it subsided within 1 hours time..)
