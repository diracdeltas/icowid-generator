After reading only one trip report on snorting 5-meo, i decided to try it. the first attempt was with a lower dose, about 5-10mg with only mild effects. maybe a +1.

the second attempt i took what apeared to be about 20mg (i dont have a scale so i am only estimating here, sorry)and snorted it thru a hollowed out bic pen.

there was some stinging and the nasal drip wasnt very pleasant altho i have snorted much worse (read MDMA and Methamphetamine).

initial onset in 5min. slight 'buzz' feeling and some mild depersonalization

this gradually built up to the peak in about 20-30min.

durring the onset there was some mild nausea and some shakyness in my hands and legs. walking was still possible but tough. i tried watching a bit of tv as the drug took hold and my attention span become shorter and shorter till eventually the tv just annoyed me and i shut it off and went into my bedroom and put on some ambient music as anything harder would have just been to much to focus on.

i began to feel like i was on a pretty heavy dose of mushrooms with out the visuals and the mental dirt associated with it.

my thoughts were very clear and i found i could get much more from the experience than with the intense flash of smoked 5-meo-dmt

the come down was gradual and soft.. like landing a glider plane.. no strange after affects and no lingering head static that lsd can leave behind.

all in all i found this very enjoyable and would definitly do it again, maybe at a higher dosage this time
