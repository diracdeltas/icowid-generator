Today, my order of kratom arrived, 6 grams of a dark resin extract, and a few ounces of dried leaf.

I was on no other medication or drugs at the time of taking the kratom, save only for nicotine, caffeine, and pot.

I had been waiting for the kratom to arrive in the mail for a few days, and so had kept back a little hash to potentiate, and augment any possible nausea, not being sure of dosage, I made a two cups of tea, using half the resin extract, and a teaspoon of dried plant matter in each cup, at first the drink tastes intensely bitter, yet not unpleasant, that taste for it kind of grows upon ones mind with the bitterness soon being neutralised in its entirety by the numbing effect of the mitragynine upon the mucous membranes of the mouth upon which a slightly green astringent taste takes precedence.

I smoked a little weed, one or two pipefulls just as the effects were starting to take effect, this seemed to speed them up somewhat no nausea present at any time.

The effects of the kratom were starting to take effect during the consumption of the first cup, the cups with resin added were a dark muddy color, kind of like the turbid look of cheap vending machine coffee, the leaves were chewed in a quid for about an hour after drinking the tea until fully exhausted.

I began to feel a slight tingling and calm spread through me, at the same time, ever stronger waves of intense euphoria hit me again and again, I noticed quite a strong itch, which strangely enough wasn't unpleasant, although I have zero tolerance, and zero experience with opiates/oids it is everything I imagine them to be, after an hour or so, I felt sort of like in a pleasant sleepy trance, with my eyes half open, just utterly numbed out bliss, with amazingly pleasant, relaxed waking dreams, (looking back, after some opioid experience, this was my first nod) it felt/feels very pleasurable and I will do it again for sure at some time or other, might try upping dosages, so far i have had the six grams of resin in the tea, and an oz or two of herb made into tea, and half a large sack of herbage remains to be drank, along with a few grams of very good hash.

Heart rate remained at normal throughout, considerable numbness and itching was noticed, pupil dilation although small, was absent to any unusual degree.
