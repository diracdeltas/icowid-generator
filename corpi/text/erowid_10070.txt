The day started like a normal day, nothing special to make the morning memorable for any reason...

So I went thru 2 hours of school after some issues with the staff which didnt make my day any more enjoyable. So I left in search of some good cannabis and to relax and remove some of the stress of the day. So I go over to my friends house at roughly 2:00 pm.

After an hour of smoking some excellent 'kind' cannabis a friend mentioned that he had aquired some AMT. Thrilled with my previous experiences with this substance, I eagerly took 25mg off of his hands. Since not many people have insuflated AMT I decided to find out what the effects would be...

Another friend offered me some ketamine because of the serious burning sensation. However I didnt have much of a problem with it and went on to take the ketamine in one nostril and the AMT in the other. The Ketamine made itself present within five to ten minutes. About twenty to forty-five minutes later a euphoric sensation came over me, followed by a very strong stimulant sensation.

From about 3:00pm until 7:00pm I enjoyed the basic feelings of a common trip of a small/reasonable oral dose of AMT. The visual distortion came in around 5:00pm and progressed until strong closed-eye visuals and strong visual distortion became a good part of this experience. Ive been enjoying this altered state of mind for quite awhile, It is now 3:20am and the stimulant effects are still very present, euphoria is in a flux situation(constantly rushing in and out), and the open-eyed visual distortion are pretty strong still as well as very strong closed-eye visuals.

From the feelings im getting and from the average length of an experience with this item is anywhere from ten to sixteen hours, I would say I will have the stimulant effects well into the early hours of the morning [5:00am to 8:00am]
