I have dabbled in opiates for a few years and have tried most of the them from heroin to hydrocodone.  I found the non-opiate tramadol to have had the following distinct effects that I have never experienced with any opiate:

1) Clearest sinuses ever.  I don't typically take allergy medicine but I have had colds/flu where I take Sudafed or something similar and nothing cleared me out like tramadol.  The extent of the clear sinuses was remarkable. 2 friends of the same gender, age, and weight concurred on this effect.

2) A little speedy.  I experienced a prolonged version of the upbeat mental clarity/excitement that I usually experience during the first 20 minutes of the onset of dextro-amphetimine.  This lasted for 2.5-3 hours with tramadol.

Other than that I found it to be pleasant and mildly euphoric, along the lines of a 5-10mg dose of hydrocodone.
