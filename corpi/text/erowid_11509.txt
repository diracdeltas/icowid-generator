I had experience the pleasures of ectasy for the first time on Nov. 16. I had bought from a friend and had them tested for quality. I had took them at 5 AM on Nov. 16th. ME and my father were flying to arizona for thanksgiving with relatives. It didnt kick in till I got to the airport which was about an hour away. I felt like running through the airport hugging everyone I saw and wanted to know them. We had gotten on the plane and I asked to sit first class cause I was 'chlrostrophobic'.

Right before take off I had put on some trance like music and slowly closed my eyes and when it happened I felt like I was moving up 2 god, kissing the sky and riding on the clouds. The water was clear and I saw everything below it in perfect shape, the clouds slowly moved and started to perpetuate colors. I had closed my eyes once again because the high was so intense with the alittude change and I heard my name being called from all around I tried to call back out but no words were spoken.

The 4 hour and something minute ride felt like 2 seconds. The time lapse, which was 3 hours behind, had me confused as to where I was and why I was there. I had deboarded and ran through the airport trying to find my ride. An hour past when I finally found my ride and I hugged the limo driver, I was happy he was alive. The mountains in arizona were beautiful, flowing colors and the skyline was amazing. Later on to watch the sun set and bask in its glory I ate another pill and let the sun set. I realized that there was more to life then I have ever before. Everything was so clear in my life. It was the happiest hours of my life.
