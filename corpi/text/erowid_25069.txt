I am a surgeon who, when younger, experimented with nearly any drug the readers can imagine. Except for a rare joint, I abstain from drug use now. (Who wants a surgeon who uses drugs?).

I became aware of salvia via the internet about a year ago, was intrigued that something legal could actually work, and proceeded to order a gram of 5x extract. One night when my wife was away, I tried a hit of about 50 mg. I was watching Emeril at the time, as cooking is my hobby. Immediately after taking the hit (sustained heating, as described elsewhere), I noted the onset of circum-oral numbness. Suddenly, bright lights surrounded my peripheral vision, and for the next 1-2 minutes, in keeping with the cooking theme, red pork chops with wings came flying out of the TV screen! I would have been terrified, except that the whole thing was inherently comical. I never had such vivid hallucinations, even on LSD. After this, I felt stoned for about 1 hour, and the effects then dissipated.

In summary, salvia is a very interesting experience, but the drug doesn't seem to have great social usefulness like alcohol or, arguably, marijuana.
