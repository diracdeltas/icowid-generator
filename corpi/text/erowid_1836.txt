I've been doing MDMA for 21 years, I guess. When I first tried it, it was still legal, you could buy it in bars in New York.  I was between 16 and 18 and I would go to Greenwich village to the gay bars.

Watching people suddenly realize (1) they're gay and (2) they can have sex constantly is a lot of fun.  E fit right into that.

I had a 5 year hiatus on E, ending maybe 7 years ago. It was too difficult to deal with the second day through fifth day crash.  After the hiatus, the crash was just as bad, but now I'm a more stable person so I can handle it better.
