Where to begin? My enjoyment began in 1998. I have pretty much been eating them constantly, at a rate of over 1,000 mgs a day, and without reservation to the consequences of such insane proportions of excess with these little orange pills. What I have noticed is the onset of parkinson like tremours and hallucinations which manifest themselves at inopertune times like when I am driving. Glad you can't smell them on your breath.

Mentally the trip is fulfilling and yet the pleasures of human contact suffers because gravol allows me the reckon and reason to avoid conversation or opening my mouth to engage conversation because my mind is clear to realize their conversation is empty and void of permanence in the scale of something that matters or does'nt. Very rarely does the meandering sound of a voice strike a cord of confidence that requires a reply or diligent thought process to make them worth listening to. I suppose that may sound arrogant, I suppose it is but when you consider the outcome of most words you also can agree that the voices lie and are only trying to sell you a bill of goods that you can't return at walmart. Words distance me from you source, as I sit here trying my words on you, carving and manipulating you if you are listening, harmonics purity can lift, dream like the a.i. you can hear in limp bizcets remade who song. Or maybe I am screwed, and even to that there are those more screwed.

Just tripping here, paranoia apparently is felt, but to understand my own personal sorcery I must understand the senses are only senses and I am the one who controls anxiety and if the feeling of anxiety is on me it doesn't mean it's time for introspection powerful enough to through me off a cliff. I relax and realize I am and nothing else is.

I am 45years old.
