Bought a script of Tylenol 3's off of someone that afternoon, so that evening I decided to try them, as I had never tried codeine. I'd heard it wasn't as strong as most opiate prescription drugs, but I didn't pay much. Took 3 pills around 8:00 pm, & didn't feel anything at all. My girlfriend had taken the same amount, & said she felt it for sure. By 9:00 I was pissed so I took 2 more for a total of 150 mg. Then a double shot of rotgut vodka & I finally felt the equivalent of MAYBE just having 3 shots of vodka total. Would like to try again in a much higher dose, but will probably stay away from codeine as I was very unhappy with the strength of the drug.
