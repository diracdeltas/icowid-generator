Tramadol is a great pain reliever that gives me opiate-like effects with more of an energetic and euphoric feeling.  I usually take around 3 to 4 50mg pills because of the limited availability, but 5 or 6 gives me a really relaxed feeling with more of a body buzz. 

------------------------------------

Ultram takes longer to kick in than most opiates.  For me they usually take effect after about 1hr&15 minutes on an empty stomach, but around 1 1/2 hrs. when I eat. Ultram is the longest lasting pain killer for me, where it lasts for about 8 hours compared to the 4-5 hrs. of vicodin and Tylenol 3.
Ultram gives me a pretty bad temper. I get annoyed by little things that regularly wouldn't make me mad. I always wake up the next day dead tired.
