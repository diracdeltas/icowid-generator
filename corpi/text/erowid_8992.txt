This is a short story on how meth almost cost me my life.I had gotten so addicted to meth that manufactoring was the only way to afford the drug.On night while gasing the drug off I set some colman fuel on an open flame and was engulfted in flames. I had 3rd degree burns on 27% of my body. After several hours in pain a so called friend finaly decided to get me to the hospital. He was afraid of getting in trouble himself. After 2 weeks in the burn unit and skin graphs to my arms chest and stomach which I required 9 pints of blood and 400 staples I finally was able to go home.
It took another 6 weeks to even come close to being able to act or maneuver normal. People say,'I wouldn't be that dumb.' But the truth is, When your under the influence of meth you can't think straight. I knew better than to put colman fuel over an open flame.

I still to this day don't understand why I done it.

I'm finally getting help for my drug addiction and feeling stronger than ever. I want people to know that there is people who understand and there is help.The biggest step is to admit you have a problem and ask for help.
