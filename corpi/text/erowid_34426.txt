I had been smoking for about a year, but have never had an experience like this.  I was hiking alone in the woods when I came across a tree growing out over a stream, a perfect place to take a rest.  I sat down on the tree and began packing a hitter.  By the time I finished my third hitter, I lay back and began watching the leaves of the many small maple saplings that were surounding me.  As I slowly unfocused my eyes I started to see not just the movements of the leaves but also the movements of the air around the leaves, in fact my surroundings took on a 'wavy' appearance.  I sat back up and changed my perspective by changing the side of the tree I sat on.  I watched the stream for a while and began to concentrate on the sound it was making.  After a little bit I began hearing a sort of whispering sound, almost like formed words but just past the recognizable.  Shortly after that occurance I decided to continue my hike up the hill to a more familiar part of the woods.
