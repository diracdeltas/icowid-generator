After consuming 0.2 grams of Salvia Divinorum X25 extract, I experienced the usual (for me) pattern of thought. With the feeling that I am in a system of movement between the rooms in my apartment, I pick up my guitar and violently strike the strings. Playing only 2 notes I close my eyes and experience delirium. Repeating images of me climbing out of the ground on a giant plane or field keep repeating themselves into infinity. The plane appears to be my head, and it goes on and on and on and on and on.

I keep climbing out of my own head.
