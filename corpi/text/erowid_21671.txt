Let me start off by saying it is about 3 days after my 4 day bindge of DXM and Dramamine. I was taking about 900mg of Dramamine and about 900-1200mg of DXM everyday for about four days straight. The trips were amazing I am pretty new to the world of trippin. I usually just smoke a lot of weed I have done dust once before and DXM a lot that's really all. I read alot about dramamine and I thought I would give it shot.

Thursday: 600mg of Dramamine - I felt nothing but the heavyness. I was pretty upset.

Friday: 1200mg DXM 900mg Dramamine - I experince my first hullinations and I amazed buy what I see. Things floating around the room, blobs on the wall etc.

Saturday: 800mg DXM 800mg Dramamine - I start trippin within two hours of taking both. Again I amazed buy this.

Sunday: 1200mg DXM 1000mg Dramamine - Same as the day before.

First off let me start off by saying this was just doing harm to my body. For the past couple of days I have been really depressed and extremly tired. But that is the least of my problems. I experice intense nightmares every time I sleep and they scare the hell out of me. I really didn't think it was from all the pills until I asked on of my friends who had done a Dramamine bindge and he said he had intense nightmares also. I am also scared of going to sleep now due to the nightmares. I have been so out of it and it is amazing how I am able to get through my college classes. 

I am slowly returning to normal but will not abuse pills like this again. I wish I could get my hands on some shrooms or acid but thats not around out here. Evening find weed these days it hard out here. I am going to try some AMT next weekend. Hopefully these nightmares go away soon.
