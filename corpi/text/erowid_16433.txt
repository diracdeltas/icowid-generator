Yesterday, while I was in this smoke shop looking for a hooka I happened to notice a jar in the store labeled divinorum. I had read different articles on the subject and wanted to see if it really worked. I have never tried any type of hallucinogen ever, unless you count weed or ecstacy. 

Well I tried it later on at a friends house but only in a small amount. I felt this extreme buzz and kept laughing for about 5 minutes. My friend tried it too but it had no effect on him. I went home and went to sleep later with no trouble. The next day I decided to try more when my girlfriend went to work. When she left I packed a bowl in my kitchen, fired up and inhaled deeply. What happened next was totally terrifying. I was in this amassed wheel of people spinning and connecting in unison. They were saying something I couldnt understand and it seemed like it would never stop. Luckily I came to when I was like five feet from rolling right out of my second story apartment window. I just wanted to say that I am very lucky to be alive right now and I am still a bit anxious and terrified from the whole experience. If you must do this please have someone there with you because there is a strong chance that you could do some great harm to yourself!!!!!
