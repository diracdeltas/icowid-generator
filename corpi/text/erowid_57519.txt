For those in the know, the U2 tour of Australia has been a long time coming, but the Melbourne concert was finally held this weekend just past. I bought tickets a year ago to go with 3 female friends who were all going to be rolling - they having spent years living in London and being very experienced in party pills. Myself, I had been a big pot smoker in earlier years but gave that up after a few bad experiences - hyper-paranoia and feelings of dread that brought on depression. It was because of this that I had avoided other drugs for years. My friends had sourced a number of pills and had tried some already so they knew they were good quality and even though I had said I wouldn't be trying, they brought a couple of spares in case I changed my mind.

About 1/2 way through the concert during a short break my friend R turned to me and asked if I may want to give it a go, they had all popped a half tab on the walk to the stadium and she assured me that they would be there to take care of me. I thought 'what the hell' and stopped being such a pussy. took the whole pill that she passed to me and - to the grins of the other girls - and popped it down.  The concert was quite good, but I seemed too focused on waiting for the hit ... after about 40 min I got the slightest buzz and noticed some halos around lights but that was it.

The concert ended and we started walking to the Star Bar on Clarendon St (Melbourne) - As we crossed the Yarra river the girls ducked behind a pillar and pulled out the pills - R passed me another so I popped it and we continued on our way. We got into the Star and had a beer on the bottom floor where a cover band played a bit of rock - the girls were obviously in the zone and we headed upstairs where the DJ was pumping.

I grabbed some water and went to a side with the girls who were all dancing to the music - I took my usual pose leaning at the wall, glass in hand (not being much of a dancer) after a few songs I suddenly found myself moving to the music and had this urge to join them ... I do dance with a lot of piss in me but this was different, I wasn't dancing because I was feeling left out, I could actually feel the music pushing up through the soles of my feet and flowing out my fingertips. One of the girls could see I was getting into it and pulled out some gum for me which was an explosion of spearmint flavor in my mouth, she was smiling with this cheeky grin and turned to the others and said 'Oh, no - we've created a monster' with a bit of a chuckle. We are very close and are a huggy lot anyway, two of the girls are ex's and the other is my best friend in the whole world and a lot of hugging, kisses on the cheek and grinning ensued, but it felt so much more than any other hug I had ever had, so intense and it was like energy flowed between and amongst us.

The dancing got faster and harder and I took my time to get enough icy water into me and took time to chill out on the lounges from time to time or stand in front of the huge fans in the corners of the room. I met a girl at one of the fans, she was gorgeous and had a great figure with this beautiful loose-fitting lemon dress - her brown hair was being blown by the fan and it looked like it was made of dark water flowing down a waterfall, she was in her own world, swaying in front of the fan and I must have stared at her for a full minute ... but without a single thought of her sexiness, or checking her out at all, I was just transfixed by her movement and the way she and the music seems to become a single living organism.

She turned to let the cooling breeze and looked at me, but instead of ignoring me (like many girls do) she beckoned to me and said 'come and share my breeze', which I did ... we must have danced for about 5 minutes, hardly saying a word, but I felt like we were communicating on another level. as the DJ encountered a tech problem for a few moments she asked if I had water, which I didn't so she disapeared, I thought, oh well, that's her excuse to leave, but wasn't really all that disappointed, but only moments later she returned from the bar with water for us both. As she pulled out a handful of ice and rubbed it on her shoulders, I leaned towards her and said 'I'm a big fan of the fan' - to which she said she was a big fan also. We didn't do a lot more talking, but my friends joined us then and much more dancing continued. Hey, there's no fantastic finish to say we hooked up, or anything like that, cause we didn't, but it was just one of the many experiences I had that for some reason seemed deeply profound and moving. I felt so good to be there with my friends, to love them and to feel loved in a way I have never felt before.

The whole experience from the first noticeable effect of the second pill was perhaps 4 1/2 hours which had a couple of waves towards the start and probably 3 hours of a constant intense high which quickly diminished at the end ... no downer afterwards, though a couple of the girls had that effect, and a little bit of a tummy upset the following day. I am looking forward to New Years Eve now as the girls have booked tickets for a huge dance party and we will have more pills to sample - I can't wait.
