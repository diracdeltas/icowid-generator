I have taken quite a few pills in my life I found these to be a little different. I first took 2 pills and felt no effects for awhile so I decided to take another 1. I began to think nothing would happen then finally it kicked in causing a euphoric and calm feeling. I watched some tv for awhile then went out for a walk I enjoyed the pills and found them worth the while. 

That night I went to sleep and had continued vivid dreams and woke up many times in the night but was not upset by this. In the morning I walked to my bus stop and smoked a cigarette rather quickly (I don't usually smoke cigarettes). I still thought I felt effects from the pills but soon on the bus and when I was at school I started sweating some and feeling slightly nauseous and like I may throw possibly because i smoked a cigarette quickly or I heard this can be after effects from the pills but I felt better once I just drank some water. Over all even with the nausea I would still say it was a good experience and I am trying them again to see if it was that which caused the sickness for sure.
