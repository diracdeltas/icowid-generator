Well this was my first experience with acid.. I have taken other stuff before, but this was definitely new. I was a music festival, drank some beer and smoked a shitload of weed while on acid. I only took half a tab cuz my friend had taken it the night before and had gotten really fucked up, and since it was my first time, I tried to take it easy. It took about an hour to hit. At first I remember staring at the clouds and it seemed like they were just zooming in and out. Then I decided I needed to go pee. I walked for what seemed like forever. When I got back to my friends I was all muddy. I don't know where I had gone or why I was dirty. After that everything felt wet. My clothes were all damp, I felt like I had pissed all over myself....everyone else felt all wet too... everything I touched!

After that we all went to see the Flaming Lips. Now if you've never tripped and are familiar with this band, this is the time to do it! Oh my GOD, the trips I had. My fiends kept telling me I kept putting my head down and closing my eyes really tight....I was seeing flames everywhere. At one point the vocalist poured blood on his face and when I saw that, everything was bloody. I saw soooo many things....I also felt like I was lying underground for a while and watching everyone pass over me. 

The trip lasted most of the night.... the next morning every time I would smoke weed I felt like I would zone in and out of the trip. I also was able to day dream really well...I would completely zone out for a while and whatever I imagined would be so incredibly real. 

As far as aftermath, I never felt anything bad, but that could have to do with smoking a couple of bowls the next day. Overall, I would definitely do it again, but only in specific settings. It really easy to zone out and forget where you are and come back all muddy...
