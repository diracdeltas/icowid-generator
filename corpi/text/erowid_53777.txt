I was prescribed Lorazepam by my doctor to relieve my anxiety over flying when travelling. Recently I've been suffering panic attacks while staying the night at my boyfriend's place. If anyone is aware of the pain of true, disorder-induced panic attacks, they know how awful it can be, especially nightly.

Anyhow, it was suggested to me by my mother to try the Lorazepam when I'm out for the evening (of course she meant only rarely, and I've taken it nearly every night). 

Every single night that I sleep using Ativan/Lorazepam, my boyfriend says I've been talking in my sleep. On top of that, every night while on it, I have woken up, but due to the sedative, I'm only partially conscious. In this state of mild-drug-induced half awakedness, I blurt things out that are only cohesive to the dream I was having, colors are more vivid, and the world spins. It's basically like being half in a dream, half in reality. But this only happens if one wakes up from the sleep the pills have helped induce.

I only take 2-3 of the pills, at .5 mg each, so I have never exceeded a 1.5mg dose. I figure passed that point, I can reach a high without having to fall asleep first. However, with my panic attacks, I'm not one to test that theory.
