I am a 5 foot 10 27 yr old otherwise healthy nursing student who about a month ago started  taking effexor for depression, and also started smoking pot again about a month before taking the effexor.

Two weeks ago at work I had my first seizure right after I had run home to change my shoes and have a few tokes off a joint. I only live three minutes from my job, but any ways I walk in the door of my work say something that makes no sense and drop head first into a mirror and proceed to have 10 minute seizure. I was transported to our local hospital by ambulance where I was treated for a concussion and lacerations. I was given a CT scan and xrays and sent home. I was supposed to stay with my parents for a few days so I could be watched so I drove home to get a few things and preceeded to have a few tokes again before I drove back to my parents house. Within 5 minutes of walking in the door of my parents house I had another seizure this time lasting 11 minutes. I have quit taking effexor.
