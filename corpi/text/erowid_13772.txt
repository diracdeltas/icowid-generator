I've done AMT for the last 7-8 months. And at a party not to long ago a friend I snorted two capsules doubled up. (80 mg apiece for a total of 160 mg) After about 20-25 min. I was in the bathroom throwing up. I figured everything was all right. I threw up many times from amt. after about 5 min. of intense throwing up i went into convolsions and foaming out of the nose and mouth.  I could bearley breath. This lasted for about 3 min. and as quik as it started it stoped. I was fine and never higher. But even though the high was great after that I will never be that stupid again. I know I OD'd that night and I scared myself cause I feel I can control all my drugs and my drug use. But by not paying attention and thinking I was that inviceable I almost killed myself. so I just want everyone to realy pay attention to how much they take. Cause u might not be as lucky.... you could foam at the mouth and go into confulsions and you might not stop till u choke on your vomit or your heart might stop. So please be smart about your drug use.
