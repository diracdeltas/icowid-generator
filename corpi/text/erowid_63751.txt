I purchased a 150 count bottle of 3 mg each melatonin tablets (my sleep pattern sucks ass) and 35 bags of yerba mate dried herb intended for tea. Made the tea, drank it, waited approx. 3 minutes, took my melatonin. the tea itself even going down the throat is calming, even I've discovered it's meant to be a stimulant. The going up on the tea was really really smooth, and enjoyable as I felt content accepting understanding and overall great. Peaking on the tea the melatonin tabs started working. Melatonin relaxed me and give me the ability to sleep when I wish but didn't knock me out. 

I kid you not I fell asleep fast I slept through the night for the first time in months! I woke the next morning and arose very easily and was ready to take on my day with a great big smile(like the actual yerba mate box actually suggested).
