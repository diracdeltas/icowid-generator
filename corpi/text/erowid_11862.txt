I started out a 4 hour drive around the time I usually go to sleep.  Took 100mg of provigil about 30 min before shoving off.  Onset was felt much more acutely than when I have taken it upon waking.  Almost paranoid awareness, jaw tension, face tingles and slight skin itchiness.  Looking at the bottle, it advises to not take while operating machinary or driving a vehicle.  I noticed nothing that might have impaired my ability to drive.

On the contrary, all evidence of fatigue vanished within 20 min of the 1st dose.  Driving in NYC traffic getting to route 95 was made easier by my extreme mental alertness.  Suprisingly unlike other sims, time seemed to be able to stretch and compress as needed.  In heavy traffic I was able to manuver with all the skill I had.  On long stretches of highway, it seemed like time sped up and more than once I looked at the odometer and was like 'wouh, I did 100 miles already?'.  Took a pit stop and got some food.

This is something else I noticed.. my appetite wasn't really suppressed.  I didn't feel hungry like I knew I should after not eating for 3 hours, but I was very able to eat unlike amphet stims. Took the other half of the 200mg tab when I started to feel a bit of a rush of drowsiness.. which was expected as I was normally fast asleep at that time and had been up for 18 hours at that point.  This kept me going until I reached my destination.  Again after ingesting some liquor I noticed more of a buzzing than usual.  16 hours after taking the 1st dose I found myself passing out where I sat, very suddenly as if a switch was turned.
