I have taken Adderall several times. I started at 15mg, and now I am at 30mg.  Often, after or durring the 'high' I would get chest and heart pains, sometime lasting days.
But, the last 3 times (each 30mg) I haven't. The first two I made sure I ate a granola bar while I took the pills and took a tums before hand. Also, I made sure I'd eat a little something at school, even if I wasn't hungry.

This last time, I ate the granola bar, but forgot to take a tums, also I didn't eat anything at school. About 7 hours later I strated fealing the chest pains comming on, so I took two tums. That seamed to make it better. I don't know if tums and eating really helps, but from what I have encoutered it does. But it could all eb a big coincedence.

Also, my friend (with ADD) asked his doctor about chest/heart pains. She said it MIGHT be because he wasn't eating enough. But, he didn't tell her he was takming 3 times his dosage.
