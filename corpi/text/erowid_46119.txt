Recently a friend was raided with over a couple grams of the substance in his possesion.  He claimed to not know what it was so they brang it in for extensive testing.  When the results came back, we were supprised to hear that they concluded that it was some sort of female growth hormone.  The charge was dropped, yet that boggles my mind on how they concluded it was related to that... Female growth hormones.  I have experienced many hullucinogenic qualities and side effects on the drug, but I wouldn't even guess it would come back as that.
