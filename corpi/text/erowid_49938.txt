Well, I had read a lot about all sorts of different highs in the vaults, but I was more interested in the natural highs. I feel that they are a more appropriate medium through which to come into closer contact with nature and our earth. Being that there are so many different substances to try, my friend Tyler pointed me in the right direction...right to h.b. woodrose. He suggested that these curious little creatures had the most potential to trip, and based on our collaborative research, I agreed. 

I ordered some seeds from an online vendor and I decided that 10 seeds would be a good strong dose. I invited my hall mate to join in and he was quick to accept the invitation. We dropped some Dramamine to help us cope with nausea, which more or less worked wel enough. We slowly chewed the seeds one at a time and washed them down with water. They didn't taste too bad, nothing like the morning glory concoction or the amanita tea that I have had before. After consumption I had another Dramamine, bringing that total to 3.

After that we just sat around with some music playing, namely the Doors, to encourage our cerebral expansion. Very quickly after eating the seeds, maybe about 30 minutes later, we began to feel strange. The strange sensation quickly became extreme lethargy, coupled with a creeping, lingering nausea. We did not want to even move, and I even found talking to be exhausting. We decided to part ways until the effects came on more strongly, so I went to lie down and nap for a few minutes.

Needless to say, I felt too much discomfort to sleep, so I just sat there for about 30 minutes. I also want to note that about the time that we started to feel tired we also felt really cold. I wasn't shivering, but it felt like my internal temperature had decreased dramatically. After my 'nap' I got out of bed to check out the effects. I wasn't hallucinating unfortunately, but when I looked in the mirror, my pupils said that I was. They took up my entire eye. I walked around and was surprised that I was no longer tired or sick, but that these feelings were replaced by an intense rush of happiness and warmth. I was amazed that the seeds would have that kind of effect after all I have read about the discomfort lasting for the whole trip.

I journeyed into the bathroom to stare at the mirror, an activity I had found very fun while on shrooms. It had the same effect, making everything seem sharp and pronounced. I stared directly into my eyes and got lost somewhere in my gaze. It actually freaked me out because I had on this stone cold face. I laughed it off and left the bathroom. 

I stumbled to the adjoining room to see how my partner in crime was doing, and he was up playing guitar looking very happy. I could tell from across the room that he was also very dilated. We talked about the feeling and were both impressed. He said he did not believe that such strong feelings of happiness would follow the sick feling of ealier. We talked and kept saying how wierd the feeling was, unlike any other substance we have previously used. Our conversation was coherent, but we couldn't string together any normal thoughts. I felt really giddy and funny, like I had smoked some bud for the first time in a long time. But I didn't feel high like bud, rather, I felt a rush of energy throughout my body. 

I decided to take a walk around campus because we have a lot of big tress and sidewalks. Right off the back, I was aware of how clear my vision was and how crisp and clean everything appeared. I liked the new perspective I got while looking around, it was as if I was walking around campus for the first itme. I saw everything in a larger, broader view, taking into view a lot more at a time than I had previously. It was fun to sit down and listen to the distant conversations of students walking around, their voices echoing and wavering. Walking around, my feet felt light, but my steps were heavy and stompy at times. But to contradict that, they also very light and walking up hills didn't seem taxing at all. 

I returned back to my dorm to start another activity. I encountered my friend and told him about my walk. He was hungry, and I too noticed some munchies. I had some cheez its and they were delicious. We then decided to drink to see if that would heighten the experience. Indeed it did. We had countless 'kindergarteners,' the so called creation of apple juice and cheap vodka. We noticed that the drinks went down very smooth, even slimy feeling. And after each gulp, the alcohol would smack us in the face with a nice buzz. It was a lot easier to feel the drink taking effect than usual. We decided it would be fun to watch some Seinfeld, season 6, which we did- for several hours. We watched at least 10 episodes back to back. At first, the seeds had impaired my ability to follow along like I had always been able to. This is like earlier when I was not able to string together any ideas, my flow of thought being very choppy and sporadic. 

It had been about three hours since we took the seeds, and we were definitely peaking at this point. I don't know if the alcohol was overriding the lsa, but the intense buzz from the woodrose wore off quickly and I was more or less back to my old self. But still, I was definitely under the influence of the seeds which now acted as a multiplier of the vodka. It was the best drunk feeling ever. I was coherent the whole time, but noticeably drunk. That is, until I passed out around 2 a.m. or so. 

I woke up today with no side effects from the seeds, just a little hung over from the alcohol. All in all, the experience was definitely worth it. Next time I think I will double to dosage to 20 seeds and see if I have a more psychedelic, visionary experience that I was shooting for the first time. Nonetheless, I had a great time as soon as the nausea and lethargy wore off after about an hour of coming on. I would recommend the Dramamine because I was borderline to where I could almost puke. Other than that, according to my experience, a good dose to start would be 10, and then you can shoot on up from there.
