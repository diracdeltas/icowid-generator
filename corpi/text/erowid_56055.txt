I was able to obtain 4 patches that had been used and removed after 2 days. One was 75 mcg, and 3 were 25mcg. I wore the patches simultaneously for 4.5 hours, and felt a bit of a high, though not much. I then cut them open and tried to put the gel on a cigarette, but the inside of the patches were dry, so I thought that my physical feelings were psychomatic. I then licked the inside of one of them, and sucked on the inside of the other three for about 1 minute maximum, since I had read of other bad experiences by people who had sucked on them for too long.

I honestly did not expect anything to happen, but after several minutes, began to feel an opiate high. Upon looking in the mirror, I saw that my pupils were constricted (not quite pinpoints, but much smaller and non reactive to light). Over the course of the next 2 hours, it seemed to get stronger, and I noticed my pulse was much faster--though that could have been anxiety due to fear of having taken too much of this drug.

7 hours after beginning this experiment, I tried to go to sleep, but it was a broken sleep, and I have several vivid dreams.

It is now the next day, and I have a hangover feeling, which surprises me given that the patches seemed empty when I cut them open.

If my reaction to the patches was so strong when they seemed empty, I can only imagine what using a full strength patch could do, especially if not used as directed. I strongly caution those who want to try Fentanyl to be extremely careful, since I am convinced it is easy to overdose on this drug.

I should add that I am not opiate naive. I have used codeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, demerol, morphine, dilaudid and tramadol. I have a general idea of how much my body can take, and I think I cannot take a lot of Fentanyl. I might try this again, but would be even more cautious.
