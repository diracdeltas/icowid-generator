Much to my dismay, I'm giving up E after only two sessions. I love the euphoria and the empathetic bonding with my partner, but the recovery period is way too taxing to make it worthwhile. 

Twelve hours after each session I was fatigued and uncomfortable, and had pronounced muscle spasms & jitters. It felt like 'restless leg' syndrome throughout my entire body. Twenty-four hours after each session I fell into a horrid depression that went beyond listlessness into outright anguish. My sleep was punctuated by night terrors, and I felt suicidal. If not for emergency doses of 5-HTP I might not have made it. (Seriously, 5-HTP is a miracle.)

If my partner and I ever have personal problems that would benefit from the extreme honesty and patience that a therapeutic E session allows, I might roll again, but I won't party with it any more.
