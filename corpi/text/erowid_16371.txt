Well here's a little back ground, I'm 17 an have only used drugs for about a year, I've used coke with good control and taked some other Opietes,

I was offered some Heroin from a friend who sold it, I took a small line then went home I lived in walking distance, I came home very talkative, then I go a strong warmth over my whole body, I laid down, and put some music on, so I can take in the full experiences, I start to get sick, I never throw up but sure felt like u could, I held it back b/c my parents where home, about a month later I want to see it I could have a better experience I did have half the bag, and go the same experience it was slightly more impressive, but it was no coke, another month I bought another back a decided, to do the whole bag, no one was home so I carved out four lines and did, them all within 2 mins. It hit within, 3 mins, I felt amazing it started in my head and moved down, I sat in front of my computer, I couldnt move I was in bliss, I was just soaking it up I tried to stand up and felt almost drunk but it made my legs feel so warm as if I was standing in warm water, I would close my eyes and just think about the great feeling I felt like I was sleeping but I wasn't, I had to throw up a couple of times but it wasn't bad, it was just like I had to go to pee, it was just something I had to do, it wasn't like a flu sick just like I had to do it, O and the Itch I spent most of the time just rubbing my face not really itching or scratching just rubbing touching, all in all it was amazing do it with control
