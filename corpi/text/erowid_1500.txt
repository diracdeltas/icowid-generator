I've smoked and eaten salvia a number of times to only have a mild trip almost not recognisable. Maybe cause I never smoked it out of a bong until the other day when I decided to introduce this magical indian plant to a couple of my friends.  I packed the bowl, placed it in the bong and ripped it up in one hit which I held in for a second then exhaled. 

Immediately I tasted the salvia (i've read a lot about how it is harsh but it doesn't seem it to me, just bitter). Then i instantly began to trip harder than I had before off of salvia.  It was very much like the peak of a mushroom trip but only for a few moments. My friend didn't believe it hit me so quick and thought I was fucking with him so I packed him a bowl. He hit it and instantly began laughing trying to call his brother into the room. I could see he was having a hard time speaking. His brother entered the room took one hit and started mumbling about how he could feel it in his head then his arms to fingers to legs back to fingers and arms. I offered him another hit, but he was all set.  So me and my friend continued to smoke bowls one by one until it was gone.  Every time I took my hit I felt it but not like the first one I took which was incredibly strong. Afterwards, both of my friends thanked me and said I opened their eyes to a new light...and it was like nothing they ever experienced before.
