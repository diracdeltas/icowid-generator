After a friend made a short drive to go pick up some capsules of 2CB for me, I, along with a couple of my friends, decided to break up a couple of lines. I thought it would be an alright idea after finding online that someone had said it could be taken orally and nasally. We split up a few very large lines of the white powder after popping open the capsules. Immidiately after i finished my line i went to clear my nostrils and found i couldnt get ANY air to go through. I couldnt tell why but I WONT EVER AGAIN BLOW 2CB!!! It was absolutely wretched for almost 3 hours, I did end up being absolutely fucking retarded later on in the night, so in the end it was almost worth it, but i SO seriously say I will NEVER snort 2CB. I had to write this all with one eye closed ;)
