I've read a number of reports that suggest that Paxil (paroxetine) may be addictive. I was on a high dose (60 mg a day) for depression for about 2 months. Then my doctor suggested I try Luvox (fluvoxamine maleate). He said to take 60 mg of paroxetine the next day, 40 mg the day after, then 20 mg, then nothing, and then to start on the Luvox. Believe me, these things are not addictive. At least not in my experience. I know what it feels like to be 'addicted'. I am nearly an alchoholic and have an extensive usage history of LSD, speed and marijuana. When something is 'addictive', in the clinical sense, it means the body requires increasingly bigger doses to attain the same original effect. This is not the case with Paxil (its called Aropax here in Australia). I suggest that perhaps these are either effects manifested by the particular user (the opposite equivelent of a placebo) or depression setting in because of a depletion of serotonin. This chemical does not appear to be addictive. Those chemists who engineer such psychoactives aren't stupid, and would know whether or not a chemical has the potential to be addictive.
