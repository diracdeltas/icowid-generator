I popped them at 6:oo pm.  Around 6:40 I started feeling euphoric and in a talkative mood, anyone that I talked to on my aol I had a great conversation with. My speech wasn't impaired at all but walking was a little hard. I went outside to get the mail and the wind was blowing my hair around and i just felt like sitting out there all night, it was amazing. After a while I didn't really have anyone to talk to so I decided to test out my motor skills by playin guitar for a little bit. It seemed to have no effect really, I could play just as well as I could any other time, if not better. It peaked around 7:45 and it sort of felt like previous experiences with pot but without the munchies and laughing.

At 8:30 the effects were still working not as strongly as it was at its peak but still nice. 9:30 I still felt the same as i did at 8:30 which pleased me. Once both my parents finally got home along with my little brothers I wasn't as buzzed as before but they didn't notice anything odd.

Vicodin turned out to be a good experience that I would love to have alot more.
