A normal day. Work. The same dreary monotony that comes with a nine to five job--sheer boredom. However, today I would meet with my antithetical self--the closest of persons in my life. Upon his return from his academic leave we agreed to exchange christmas presents as a way to reconcile the enmity that has mounted over the years. I innocently gave him a shirt and in exchange he offered me two hits of Foxy.

I ingested a single pill not knowing what i was getting myself into but not caring much, just excitement and anticipation. After about forty minutes i started feeling the onset which induced a wobbly feeling--slightly loosing control of motor function, but pleasant and subtle. After some time passed euphoria settled in and i felt nice and comfortable sitting on my couch and just absorbing the domestic scenery, which protruded a warm and vibrant aesthetic. All was well, nothing dynamic just soft imagery and magnificent contentment.

After a couple of hours--probably three or so--the euphoria and contentment began to subside. The overall trip was gentle and delightful.<!--I would recommend Foxy to anyone who cant handle dynamic substances because it is  subtle and pleasant.-->
