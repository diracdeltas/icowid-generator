I'd tried morning glory and Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds in the past, at the dosages recommended on the internet (five - twelve seeds), without much success. The first time I tried morning glory seed, I had something very slight happen but not worth mentioning. I tried eight Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, and experienced a mild, distracted frame of mind that kept me up all night. I could feel there was more possible with these seeds, so one day I decided to ingest more.

My family life had been riding an insane roller coaster for the last few months, with all kinds of horrible surprises and random reconciliations. This day was a good day, things were calm and everything seemed ok. I had been trying to get some LSD, but without much immediate success. I was somewhat dejected about this, but not especially so.

For a moment the house was empty, I had it all to myself. I remembered my big baggy of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. I grabbed it and counted out twenty seeds. I remembered the last time, with eight seeds, tediously scraping off the coating for an hour only to have a horrible stomach ache despite my labors. So, instead of painstakingly scraping off the coating, I just peeled off the bark-like stuff on the outside and threw the seeds in a grinder. These things are rock hard, and after a few minutes of grinding I had a powder with some hard chunks of seed.

I took the powder and put it in a tall glass of water, then proceeded to drink it, swallowing the chunks like pills. In the future I plan on grinding the seeds more thoroughly, and putting them in a milkshake or some such beverage to mask the taste. There is a lingering queasiness to these seeds that pervades their taste, it really isn't pleasant. I downed the muck, and decided to go about things for awhile, until I was unable. Based on my past experience with the seeds, and hallucinogens in general, I didn't expect too much from them. About thirty minutes after ingesting the mess, the uneasiness in my stomach began to turn to nausea. Without hesitation, I grabbed my pipe and smoked a small bowl of Cannabis. Over the last few months, I'd been drastically cutting back my cannabis consumption for various reasons, but I still know it makes stomach pain go right away. Sure enough, the one bowl eased my stomach.

I went from my bathroom to my room, and tried talking to some friends via the internet. I could tell something was off. I had a huge smile that wouldn't go away, but I didn't know why it was there to begin with, which of course I found hilarious. I tried putting on some music, but my computer refused to work! No sound would come out of the speakers. I was still with it enough to know how to remedy the problem, but nothing was working. Frustrated, I put my computer (a laptop) aside and decided to lie back and relax, and try to come up with some ideas on what to do.

There is a poster on the wall of my room that's been there since before it was my room. It is black with colorful letters on it that spell out various names of God from the Bible, with references and all. I began reading the poster, for the first time in a long time. I kept reading it over and over, maybe a hundred times, I can't be sure. My concentration was now shallow but intent. I began interpreting each name on the poster, understanding exactly what it meant. After awhile, I began tripping on the poster. Individual names would stretch and fill the whole poster, the poster itself would grow in size and undulate, etc. At the time I didn't realize just how active my vision was. Everything was doing something, mostly anything with writing of any kind (my clock, the poster, books on the shelves) would expand and grow larger, magnified so I could read it.

After an indeterminate amount of time (more than an hour and a half), I began to be overwhelmed by the poster. My thoughts were starting to fire off at the speed of light, and the visual trips intensified. I remembered that I had a Bible nearby, and immediately I grabbed it. I began to read. While reading and concentrating best I could on the reading, I started to come up more and more and more. I suddenly understood everything about the Bible, the stories, the meaning of God and evil. I am a philosophically inclined person, I'm always reading about these things in various context, so thinking about these things was something I enjoyed very much.

As I was reading, visuals became more and more intense, my right arm became semi-transparent like a tropical fish, with patterns on it. My proprioception was all over the place, I felt as if I was actively controlling every bodily process, including breathing. The Bible I was reading became an enormous structure, somewhat like a monolith of cinematic fame, but not quite. My being was flying, floating in front of this gargantuan work as I was being infused with comprehension of all kinds. I wasn't sure if my eyes were open or shut, because my surroundings became like space, with just my growing understanding and the Bible still present.

I continued to climb for some time, to the point that I completely lost my body. I was moved to (or shown?) a realm of pure energy I had never seen before. My mind and soul were there, but my body was nowhere and I couldn't care less. I was doused with intermittent feelings of euphoria well beyond anything else I've ever experienced and sorrow, though the trip was never what I'd call "bad." I was allowed to observe a divine aspect of everything, I was being clued in to a supreme metaphor, and I was being overloaded with concepts and revelations.

It became known to me gradually the real reality of what being human is. I saw that my body and mind were filters, filtering out this vast scope of information that was there the whole time. It was as if I was seeing dimensions beyond those I'd ever been allowed to see, dimensions of tangible abstract, of being, of energy, and more. Yet they were always there, I just was spared the understanding of them. It defies description. I was in this place for some time.

After awhile, my mind began to tire. My brain was fatigued, overloaded with information not meant to be communicated by mortal means. I started to re-appear in my body. I was lying on my bed, completely soaked in sweat and who-knows-what, utterly drenched. My energy was drained, but my mind was still active and I couldn't stop it. I started staring at my curtains and tripping on them, but after a short while of looking at any one thing or area my eyes began violently shaking left to right, it was uncomfortable and tiring. I closed them for some time, and experienced more mind-tripping, but was far too exhausted to carry on with it.

Finally, I forced myself to open my eyes. I was in a contorted position, wearing a t-shirt and blue jeans. The denim fibers were a sight to behold, they rippled and undulated, breathing all the while. The hairs on my arm would zoom in, as if in a bubble, and travel across my vision. This would happen with various things I concentrated on. At this point I noticed that my stomach was in pain, but I didn't care and was able to zone it out of my mind, allowing the visuals to wash over me and relax me.

Roughly six hours after I ingested the twenty seeds, I thought I was back. The visuals were fading and my stomach became much harder to ignore. I grabbed a brown paper bag to vomit in, but after spitting up some grossness for a few minutes I began to intensely trip on the inside walls of the paper bag. Once this started, my stomach again vanished from my being. I continued tripping visually for a few hours, then became very tired.

I turned out the lights and tried to sleep, but my mind was still racing and visual distortions abounded. I'm not entirely sure if I slept that night, if I did, it wasn't a restful sleep. In the morning, I got up from my bed to shower. I was a mess and smelled it. I walked into my bathroom and beheld a bright reflection of sunlight off a section of white wall. From this, a kaleidoscope of yellow rushed at me and my head began to hurt intensely. I kept getting head rushes and losing my vision for brief periods throughout the day. In the shower I tripped again, it took far too much concentration to break away and do anything. Anything white or yellow that I saw touched by sunlight was electric, and parallel lines like those in tile grout undulated and breathed. My stomach was uneasy for quite some time.

It wasn't until the next day, after getting a full night's sleep and eating a good meal or two, that I felt back to normal. The visual distortions ceased and I could hold a train of thought again. Bodily processes felt normal again, that is, walking, sitting, eating, etc, and I knew I was back.

Eight seeds did next to nothing for me, but twenty gave me the most profound experience and intense trip of my entire life.
