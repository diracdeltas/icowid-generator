<!--not sure whether to post this but good for on-file i guess-->

Over the last year I've known 3 women who have used Ketamine extensively, and have seen a particular trend regarding their menstruation/reproduction cycle. Of the 3 two used small amounts of K on an extremely regular basis (I've seen cokeheads that snort less), and they both had very irregular cycles, sometimes bleeding 3 times a month. It's doubtful that this is due to any other substance, as Ketamine is the only thing they were using on a regular basis. As for the other female (my girlfriend), she takes anaesthetic/'K-Hole' doses almost exclusively (her K use is otherwise pretty tame), and in the last year she's had 2 probable miscarriages immediately following a K-Hole dose (within 48 hours). She normally has irregular cycles, so we couldn't judge the K's effect on that, but in each of these two cases there was a decent probability that she was pregnant (for 1-2 weeks) and the amount of bleeding and cramps caused was way beyond that of a normal period (hence the miscarriage guess). It wasn't until this second one a couple days ago that we made the connection, but it seems quite likely that at least in her case a high dosage of Ketamine causes her cycle to start again, possibly going so far as to abort a pregnancy.

Given the above, I feel that the effects of Ketamine on the female reproductive system should definitely be looked in to, especially since I have yet to find any documentation online regarding it. I may not be a doctor, but given my experiences (well, their's) I'd strongly recommend that any female users of Ketamine stop if they believe they are pregnant, and monitor your menstrual cycles for any irregularities caused by K. In fact, if you have been experiencing any of the above side-effects, let Erowid know so if there's a definite trend here they'll be able to catch it and get the warning/information out.
