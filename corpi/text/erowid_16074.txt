I had heard that dramamine is like no other drug out there.  When I read this I got very excited to use it.  My drug experiences are too numerous to name.  At about 8:30 me and two of my friends m and c went to wall mart to get some dramamine pills.  I took six to start off at about 9:00.  I waited an hour without it effecting me too much.  So I then took two more at 10:00.  After an hour I just had a really strong high like pot.  So I downed two more to make the total 10.

It took about thirty minutes for the last batch to kick in.  I couldn't walk or move and I could barley speak.  Me and C then went to play some ps2. I was watching him play and everything seemed like a dream.  When I would close my eyes I would be somehere else with my friends like out dirtbiking or something.  And to me this was reallity.  When I opened my eyes the world around me seemed fake and I had no memory of how I got there.  But eveytime I closed my eyes I would be living out a new story.  I would recomend this drug in low a dosage.  And I am going to try it again for sure.
