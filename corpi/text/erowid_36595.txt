I am typing this after smoking 6 bowls (4 leafs) of Coleus.

2:15 AM - I feel a slight euphoria, like a contact buzz from marijuana. My train of thought it very easy to control, I have no other ideas or streams of thought running about in my head... It's almost as if my mind is hollow. I become distracted very easily by the slightest thing (wrinkles on my hand, blinking lights on the modem, scratchy places on my arm) and stay focused for a few seconds. Time is not distorted, no hallucinations *yet. As the time passes the euphoria grows slightly, still not to the strength of Marijuana, but still VERY noticible.

2:20 AM - It has only been 5 minutes, but the effects are still growing. I can feel my concentration becoming astranged and very hard to control, but it is not unpleasant. Typing has become very difficult, I appologize for the spelling errors from this point forward. I feel sedated, very calm... but not really anything special... Something along the lines of a low Valium dosage.

2:24 AM - It has hit me, I can see things are very distorted now... Objects have begun to swirl and move by themselves. I can feel the hair on my arms stand up, like static electricity is above my arm. I am very comfortable and relaxed, i feel as if nothing could possibly go wrong! I am tossing about the idea of smoking a few more bowls but I will not.

2:30 AM - I have become very spacy... I zone out all the time. I will end this report and complete it when I am able to record more. I feel like just relaxing right now!

2:40 AM - Wow, the effects come down fast! I had no idea what was going on than all of a sudden I was back to reality... I believe I may have blacked out or spaced out so far that I felt like I was asleep.

Very useful for destressing/slightly hallucinating. I only noticed warped/out of place objects, but it was nothing to write home about, very mild. It's very easy to have fun with but I can still control myself.
