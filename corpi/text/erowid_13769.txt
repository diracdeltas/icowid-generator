The prepared yopo is very chunky in parts, and is very hard to break up. And putting a gram of black dust/chunks in my nose was very unpleasant. I started to feel the initial effects within 10 min. I then went on a walk with my friends. And was fatigued quickly, and my mouth and nose were parched. This annoying throughout the trip. I never realy tripped hard on the walk, or had any visuals. Things were kind of floaty and more colorful, but that was about it. 

 By the time I got home all I wanted to do was lay down , and I figured that the trip was mostley over because it's supposed to last 30-45 min. When I got home it was 1h, 30 min from ingestion. But as I lied on my bed I had some nice closed eye visual, that were similar, but not as strong ones on dxm. It was like I could see through my eyeballs. Just from listening to peoples voice I could see where they were in the room and see what they were doing. I also watched some crazy shit through my eyelids on tv(which wasn't on). At that point the pain in my nose and dry mouth were the only down sides.

But when I stood up my motor skills were way off, I had no balance and my legs were very weak. I was able to get to sleep alright. But when I woke up my vision was fucked up, I could see things in the distance, but everything within about ten inces of my face was fuzzy, so reading became very difficult. It seems like it is slowly coming back, and I thing that my 20/20 vision will be back within a few days. 

I wouldn't do this again but I would like to try the pure chemical version of 5meo dmt, and thats what Id recomend to people interested in these chemicals.
