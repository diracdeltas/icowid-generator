Well, my good friend and myself decided to do some H.B. Woodrose. This was my first time with the Woodrose, and so wasn't sure what to expect. My friend B had some experience, but only in a low dosage, I think around six seeds. He reported a mild 'not quite with it' feeling, nothing major. He later decided to smoke some cannabis, which apparently massivley enhanced the trip.

So anyway, we started the day by having one spot of cannabis each. This would have been around 11:40. We spent around half and hour peeling the fuzzy stuff off the seeds and consumed them as we peeled. It was 12:10 (midday) by the time we finished eating all 15 seeds. The effect came on alot quicker for myself, then it did for B, I'd say I could start feeling it within 10 - 15 minutes of consumption.

By 12:20 we were feeling very stoned, and could feel the Woodrose coming on pretty fast. This was accompanyed by slight nausea. I started acting really strange, at least I felt like I was. Like I would act like a kid again, I would speak in a high pitced voice just because it was fun making mock voices (it ammused me anyway), and I was putting on quite an act. But the weird thing is, at the same time it felt like just that, an act. I could act completly sober when I wanted to, it just seemed like my 'normal' self was all fucked up, to be sober I had to make a conscience effort. There was also a noticable uplifting high, apart from sickness.

At 12:30, we were felling really stoned, and more of the above. I must also note that what started off as an 'uplifting high' had now turned into more of a bad high. We were both feeling really sick, and really negative. Almost the beginning of a bad trip, but not quite, just felt really bad, physically more than mentally, but defiently both. At this point B decided to smoke some more pot to try and combat the sickness. I'm, not sure if it worked or not, as I decided not to take any. After another 10 or so minutes the sickness had almost left me, and I was starting to feel pretty good again. 

From this point on, I can't be specific about time frames, because as we tripped, we wrote everything down on a brown paper bad (seemd a good place to write it at the time). I've been basing the report around those times. But the last entry on the bag begins with an entry around 14:20 and some crazy writing. From there the writing begins to slope and wiggle all over the page and gets totally unreadable. It's actually pretty funny looking at the bag and comparing the first few entries, which are totally readable, with the last few, and especially the last one.

So anyway, after we thought we had defeated the sickness, we decided to walk to the beach (I live right beside it). We started walking and my legs/thighs started really hurting, like they had electical currents passing through them, really uncomfortable and sore. It got worse and worse, and I was almost gunna sit down, but I just put up with it. 

We got to the beach and I sat down in front of the surf becide a peice of washed up wood, and I started to feel realllly bad, and realllly sick. I knew I was about to spew, and I managed to utter a short warning to clear the area before I embarked on one of the most intense experiences of my life (throwing up). It was such a negative experience, like my whole body was exploding and then been glued together again all at the same time. What lasted only a few short seconds seemed to last for hours. I thought I was traped in an world where all I knew was a gut wrenching vile intensity feeling, like snakes climbing up through my mouth. I compare it to the exact opposite of an orgasim, extremealy intenst, but replace the good feeling with a really bad one.

After I spewed I must have just layed there for five minutes (seemed like five hours) just totally exhausted. But I eventually came right (after about 10 minutes) and the trip took a whole new turn. After what had been on the verge of a bad trip was suddenly boosted to a new level where all the bad things were replaced by good things. It was like I was spewing up shit, like I was been cleansed from all the crap that socicety puts on us, and everything we experience.

From then on it was a really great trip. I experienced miled hallucinations, but the main feature for me was that my mind was way way clearer. Like all these little thoughts were coming to mind without me even thinking about it. As an example, I suddenly realised that 'good' and 'evil' do not even exist, they are mearly a different way of perceving the same situtation. They are the two different sides of the same coin, for good to 'exist' there must be evil, and vice versa (many little gems of wisdom came to me that day). Compared to Psilocybian, it was more of a thought high, rather than a nature/earthly high, if that makes sense.

So yeah I ended up having a really good trip in the end. We came up from the beach and we did a can of NOS each, which was cool, I imagine it to be what heorin feels like, it boosted me up to a level five trip for three seconds. B wasn't so lucky however, he continued to have a very bad trip, even after throwing up. He was very quiet, sometimes just lying on the ground moaning. He kept asking for some broccoli, so I cooked up a stirfry with rice (it's great fun to cook a meal while tripping). The next day he told me I had saved his life, by listening to him and giving him broccoli. I also forgot to mention I did another spot just before I cooked the dinner, but for some odd reason it didn't effect me at all.

All in all, despite the bumpy ride, a great experience. The whole thing must have lasted about 5 hours, but the effects still slightly noticable the next day.
