It all started a few years ago when I was at a friend's house. (for legal reasons, I'll call him Melvin). We had both dabbled with different drugs for a few years, and we thought that we knew our limits as far as certain substances were concerned. We had also had some interest in Datura because a friend of ours had recently eaten some seeds and tripped off of them. He didn't really give us details, but had said that they were extremely powerful. With that in mind, we went off to harvest some seedpods and eat the seeds. 

The plants were growing in the front yard of somebody's house. They were about 4 feet tall and had some fruits that were covered in sharp spikes. Melvin said that we'd better pick them fast so that the people whose yard we were on wouldn't bitch. We each picked about 5 seedpods and went to his house, where we opened them up, took the seeds out, and proceeded to eat some.

I remember that the seeds tasted extremely bitter, almost too bitter to keep down, but we managed. I asked how much I should take, and he said, ' about 15'. (at this point we had both eaten about 150 of them). We both kind of sat around for about 30 minutes, anticipating the trip. At the end of those 30 minutes, I began to feel very hot and everything had a 'hazy' quality to it. I also noticed that my mouth felt dryer than it ever had before. (Think of running a marathon in the Sahara Desert with no water while smoking an enormous blunt, and you will realize just how unpleasant datura cottonmouth really is.) Melvin got up to get some water for us, and then I looked at my hands for some reason. There appeared to be smoke or steam coming off them, and I started to notice that the walls were melting- not 'breathing' r 'shifting around' like on shrooms or acid- but actually melting like butter on a frying pan. At this point I became very frightened with the idea that maybe the entire world will melt into a cosmic puddle, with me and everyone I know in it melting as well. Melvin finally came back with the water and told me to 'go to the next room and look at your eyes, they're fucking HUGE!' I did just that, looking into a mirror and examining myself. I remember that my pupils were so dilated that my whole eye appeared black, and i thought that i must be some alien and then walked back to Melvin with the new-found realization that I was an alien. I don't remember too much after that, but apparently we both walked around town in a completely dazed and psychotic state all day talking to imaginary people and believing we had the ability to teleport from place to place. (some of our friends had run into us and, realizing how fucked-up we were, became our babysitters for the day and told us about parts of the trip that we couldn't remember.) After several hours of this, Melvin wandered off to the local park and some of my friends/babysitters began going home. One of them asked how I was feeling and my response was something like 'only if the water is a billion years old'. At some point somebody called my mom and told her to come pick me up because i was 'really fucked up'.

She came and picked me up and then drove me to the hospital after seeing exactly how 'fucked up' i was. (It turns out that she thought I had taken some kind of terminal, Syd Barrett-style acid trip or had suddenly gone completely insane. I was wearing no shirt or shoes, my brand-new glasses were missing, and I was ranting and raving about things that weren't there.) I ended up in the emergency room where i had to be restrained by police, orderlies, etc. because I kept trying to escape. The doctors stuck all kinds of needles in my arms and hands and i kept trying to take them out. I remember looking at my left hand and then looking at my mom saying 'Look, the Japanese blood islands.'  After that i don't remember too much about the hospital, except the day after when i was still tripping extremely hard and came to the realization that i was being held against my will and being sexually tortured with a catheter and started shreiking uncontrollably for what felt like forever (Apparently datura makes you unable to urinate, so the doctors put a catheter in my penis. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT PAIN OR FEAR IS UNTIL YOU TRY TO PULL A CATHETER OUT WHILE TRIPPING ON DATURA!!!!!!!!!!!) I was discharged about 4 days later, but i had to go to rehab after that because i was still a minor and had OD'd. For the next year or so I struggled to come to terms with what happened to my mind that day, and became very strange and reclusive without the desire to go to school or get a job or do anything, really. I finally got a job not too long ago and it has helped out my mental state a bit.

In closing, I urge anyone who wants to try datura not to try it.
