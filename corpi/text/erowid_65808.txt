In Dec 2006, I went to get a cavity filled. The dentist ended up overfilling the cavity. On top of that, my bite got misaligned. The next day, I developed terrible earaches and could not chew anything. The dentist refused to admit her mistake, but the other dentist in the practice saw her error right away and grinded the tooth down. That got rid of my earache. I was really happy because in the next week, I traveled to Toronto and Paris pain free. But on the way back, I got a horrible electric toothache. I was clutching my face and then I remembered the Percocet. I took one tablet.

Later on in the plane, I developed sharp chest pains. I would take a deep breath and hold it but it still hurt. I was so scared. The plane was having turbulence so I assumed it was some psychosomatic effect.

Around 12 hours later, I took another dose and the sharp pains intensified. Then I realized it was the Percocet, the supposed pain killer!!

I'm not sure if the Percocet itself was causing pain, or just heartburn. 

Amazingly, Ibuprofen 200mg (Motrin/Advil) around the clock, every 4-6 hours, works miracles in controlling pain.<!--Just remember to take with food and a big drink.--> Ibuprofen worked better on me than Percocet, much to my surprise.
