I had been smoking Amanita muscaria (var. formosa) for a while, preferring smoking them to eating them because of the smaller amount needed to get high, the shorter wait, and the less time invested in the trip (not to mention the awful taste of the mushrooms.)

But, I had some time, and I decided I wanted to hallucinate, so I capsulized 4 - 5 mushroom caps and swallowed the pills.. I spent the time waiting for those two dissolve and absorb by smoking some other amanitas I had. Nothing happened for about 2 hours, then I was sitting on my couch watching my hat sitting at the other end, and it appeared to be breathing and growing, but it stayed the same shape and size.. the couch behind it also appeared to grow and move (although the movements were more of the two ends of the couch reaching towards me and bending the middle.) My ceiling, which is painted in a circular pattern, looked like a satellite picture of a hurricane, the swirling clouds.

I closed my eyes and I got some closed eye stuff too... not actually seeing things, but the blackness seemed very textured and it did things like swirled, jumped around, and expanded.

Then suddenly I woke up.. the phone was ringing, and it was about 2 hours later. Oops, I'd fallen asleep. ;)

No real buzz.. I don't really find Amanitas very euphoric, (or at all) but it was still fun.
