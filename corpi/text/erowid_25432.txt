I have had a number of positive 'experiments' with this drug. 

For example one night I decided to introduce it to a friend. We both ingested about 2.5 gram of GHB. After 20 minutes none of us really felt anything special though we talked more and more openly than before. 30 minutes after ingestion we redosed with one 1.5 gram. We talked some more and it was nice and comfortable. Both of us started to feel some typical moderate dose-effects. Light headedness, a bit dizziness and so on. Later my friend was a bit too far away, but nothing dangerous - we both agreed that it had been a joyful and nice experiment, when we talked about the day after. And we both came a lot closer to each other, because of the lack of barriers the other day.
