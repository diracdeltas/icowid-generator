It was my first time using Salva Divinorum and I was very excited.  I was using it as a shamanistic tool to further expand my awarness.  But I was aware of its extreme potency.  I loaded up my homemade pipe with unfortified Oaxacan leaf.  I held my lighter close to it and took a long, deep hit.  I was suprised at how harsh the smoke was.  I held it for 20 seconds and then lit another bowl and took another long hit.  I had no idea what was about to happen. 

I layed down and closed my eyes.  Visuals were apparent but visuals is not what would be the highlight of my experience.  I opened my eyes.  I stared deep into my ceiling and felt a feeling of nothingness.  I had the sudden feeling that I was dying.  I was drifting far away from my life, friends and family.  All memories began to dissapear.  I tried to fight it, but when I did, I felt a hand grab at my ankle and force me down.  Tingles went up and down my whole body and I lay there, dying and falling into a hole of Oblivion. 

I came out of it after approximately 90 seconds.  I was still feeling empty and very weak after what happened.  I walked shakily into my bathroom and put water on my face.. For 30 minutes, I walked around my house silent and thinking.  This experience was so intense for me and I now know that Lady Salvia deserves much respect.  She is quite a teacher.
