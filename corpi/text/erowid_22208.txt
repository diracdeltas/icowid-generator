I made two cups of Calea tea, drank one in the evening and another just before bed on two consecutive evenings. I am a regular dreamer and record at least one dream a night usually more.  Well after taking the tea I had no dream recall for both of the nights!  I thought this stuff would aid in dreaming especially lucid dreaming, but not for me, it had the reverse effect.  

After drinking two cups of this foul tasting substance I hoped something might happen.  I found no auditory hallucinations no visuals with eyes open or closed and of course a reverse effect with regard to my dreaming.  I'm not giving up however, as I write this report I'm drinking a cup and will continue to explore.  Maybe I need something stronger like Salvia?
Well best of luck to you fellow dream explorers...Cheers
