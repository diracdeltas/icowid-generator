I had never tried nitrous before although I have done many other drugs, most relatably Salvia. My friend and I were watching The Beatles' Yellow Submarine. We were halfway through the intro when I get the idea of doing some nitrous. My friend agreed to try it with me and I ran to the kitchen to get a can of whipped cream. Now I had not done much research on it, all I knew was that it was short and fun.

I took the can and breathed in the gas, making sure not to let the cream come out. I got about half a lung-ful of nitrous and held it in as long as I could. My friend and I were looking at each other and started laughing. The second I breathed out the song Eleanor Rigby in the movie started and I was taken by it. I loved how the song sounded and was extatic at how I great things felt. Everything seemed liquidy and smooth. I just looked back at my friend after a little lip syncing, laughed, and handed him the whipped cream tellin him to 'hit it'. The nitrous had a mood elevating effect that last the rest of the night.

Now it was my friend's turn. He took a pretty good hit of the nitrous and held it for a few seconds. He breathed out and started laughing and looking at me. Understanding his feelings, I laughed too. I soon got a little worried we were too loud and told him to calm down a little. He just leaned back, flipped me off, and continued laughing. After he calmed down he said that he saw me as an authority figure.

We were out of nitrous.
