In 1999 I began taking 10mg of Paxil per day, just before bedtime, to treat depression.  Within a few days I began seeing a visual motion blur of high contrast objects for a few minutes after waking each morning (I call them 'trailers').  I often paint my nails with intentionally intense colors so that I can virtually paint the ceiling with the smearing effect that I see from my moving fingertips.  I also enjoy watching birds streak through the sky.

A few minutes after waking the effect completely disappears only to return the next morning.  During 1999 I gradually increased my dosage to 40mg per day, and the effect continued every morning.  In early 2000 I ceased taking Paxil, and the 'trailer' effect disappeared by the time withdrawl symptoms ended.

I returned to Paxil in late 2000, and as soon as I began taking 10mg per day the morning trailers resumed.  I presently take 30mg per day, just before bed, and see the motion blurred 'trailer' effect every morning.
