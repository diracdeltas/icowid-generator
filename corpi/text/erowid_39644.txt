Well the first time I did ice I was 12.. I had wanted to try for  along time and was really excited to. Me and my friends  went to sum hotel where my cook knew the manager ...(if u know what I mean hint hint) so he gave us a free room we started smoking at 11 til 7 in the morning the next day... I didn't really know what to expect ... B-cuz it was a high I've never had. 

I couldnt stop talking, moving, or drinking water. All of us were so dehydrated. And everyone was moving so fast. I suggest to drink lots of water before u get ready to tweek. Also, sometimes u get really hot so make ure u are well cooled..me and my friends used towels and wet them and put them around our necks. Also if u have braces and your gunna be tweekin make sure that u put wax on, bcuz when u grind ur teeth it cuts up ur cheeks horribly. I have snorted smoked and shot up ice. And my personal fav. Is smoking becuz it is almost instantaneous. Snorting after a while makes ur nose raw and has a bitter taste when it drains. I suggest eating before u tweek b-cuz when u do there is no urge to eat ANYTHING for me just looking at food made me sick. Just drink lots of water stay hydrated and keep cool.
