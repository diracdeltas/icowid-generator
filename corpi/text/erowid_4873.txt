A male friend has taken 300 MDMA pills (acquired from the same source in Amsterdam and tested with testing kits). The first 200 times were usually awesome with each use increasingly followed by a worse depression and insomnia. Ignoring these symptoms he continued to take 2-3 pills every weekend. Over Labor Day weekend he consumed 7 pills. That was the last time he used it. After the weekend he became severaly depressed and hasn't slept more then 2 hours a night in the five months since his last use. He is unable to concentrate or complete tasks. He does not remember most of the so called incredible times he had on MDMA.  He dose not smoke, drink, or take other drugs (except benzos which he used to come down of the MDMA).

Now he is afraid he has done permanent damage to his brain. He is hoping abstinence will enable him to recover. 5-HTP, melatonin and SSRI's have reduced the depression but the insomnia and memory loss are showing no signs of abating.
