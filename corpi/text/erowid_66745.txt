I was thinking of starting this web-shop for legal highs and I was trying out some good looking substances with a few of my friend (forgive the spelling but I am not American and I write this on a keyboard that tends to miss key-strokes).

One of the material we tried out where Bromo-DragonFLY. It proved to be a very powerful friend. The first time it was taken I took it myself. I tried a 'safe' dosage at 700 mcg. I was out eating pizza with two friends right after I took it and I got some serious effect already 30 min. after I took it. Since I for some reason took it without having benzo around (have never done that before with new chems) and that already turned out to be a bad thing to do. I am used to tripping since several years but once in a while i can always be caught off guard.

This time it had been longer since I took anything then I intended to believe and I was a bit cocky. I had after all bought a new company selling legal highs and 'knew what I was doing' (another site than [URL deleted] and not as good, my partners fucked it up back then). But I was too cocky.

When the effect came on to fast (it normally takes much longer, up to 6 hours for full effect) I convinced my friends that I needed some medical attending and got a ride to the hospital. At the hospital I got Xanor (alprazolam), Rohypnol (flunitrazepam), Valium (diazepam) and Stilnoct (Ambien). I wa still haulusinating very badly and had a very great trip exept for the thought that it might get worse since it started so early.

Due to this worry and the time i taken since it started I decided that I needed some heavy shit. After all, all of that benzo didn't work much at all. Didn't even get me calmer. So I asked the doctor for some anti psychotic even aware of the bad side effects with this type of compounds. And since he believed me to be a man who knew what I was talking about I go some Haldol (8 mg iv, thats much for someone who don't touch it on regular basis).

Right away things calmed down. It took me only a few minutes before I got calmer and the visions started to get lighter. I soon enough could focus on tasks again and after a few phone calls to friends and family I went to sleep.

It was nice to get an end to all those very vivid experiences that I have had. I had seen natives (not real ones at all 'cause they look different). I had also heard music that was fantastic. But no matter how beautiful my world was it could not compete with the fear of a drug overdose. Since it shouldn't have hit a high so early I was concerned from the start that the dosage was wrong and therefore Highly stronger then the one I wanted. I simple thought that I had made a mistake.

I woke up the other day feeling beaten from the Haldol. Took me more than a week to get straight in my head again.

I later discovered that we had gotten two kind of samples from our supplier but that we had mixed them together for some reason.

I have later had very good experiences with Bromo-DragonFLY. But make sure you take a normal dosage and never more than two times a normal dosage. Otherwise you can be in serious trouble.

I will not tell more about the positive effect about the drug since I am highly partial, selling this drug myself. But I wanted to warn about the dangers of overdosing since I for some very unlucky reasons experienced that (400 mcg of one version is more or less equal to 900 mcg of the other. 700 is in other words way too much if you think you took something weak and don't know it since earlier).

That concludes my story about my first attempt at our material since we bought it. We later have gotten dosage down to a good 500-1000 mcg blotters and I enjoy them myself very much these days.
