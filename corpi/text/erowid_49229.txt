I had the same exact zipper-like experience. Exactly. It's like  passing a baton in a relay race, but you aren't moving . . . the fabric of the Universe is all that moves. And you are a stitch in that fabric forever. Time ceases to exist here. It seems very pointless and it is very painful, both physically and mentally. 

I felt the fabric was actually God. My friends, who were really these zipper-people, told me this was the real reality. I had created them and myself and everything in my delusion. I was God and I was in denial. It seemed so real that I to this day (months and several less intense doses later) still question which is the real world - this one that has gone on for me 35 years, or the other one that went on for an infinity . . . or was it only seven minutes?

I'm still sorting out the experience, but I'll explain more later.
