I had already been up for two days on methaphetamine and was feeling really fatigued but could not sleep. I looked around for something to relax me and found some flexerall and proceeded to take six of them...

I don't know when it began but I began to think a friend was in the room and i talked to him for at least an hour, next thing i know I realized no one was there. So i get up and walk to a friends house and notice something shivering and huddling on her porch I began to ask her why she was doing this and as I walked forward I saw a bum wrapped in a black trash bag shivering. I began to yell at him and ask him what he was doing there. Then I realized he wasn't there.

My friend and her boyfriend are in the living room i'm slurring my words and ask my friend 'Hey baby turn the lights out' and start to touch her. I then realized what i'm doing and stop and apolagize.
We go outside for a smoke and i see the house across the street being robbed, my friend says she doesn't see anyone when they were right in front of her. I yell 'don't rob that old lady i'm calling the police' repeatly and my friend just think i'm crazy as i tell her that they are going in through the chimney...

I go back to my room and feel a presence in the room. I say i'm not afraid of it. It begins to move things... then it touches me... and I had sex with it... though i couldn't see anything I knew it was there... I talk to it for about 2 hours before i finally sleep.

flexerall is fucking eerie. THESE WERE THE MOST INTENSE VISUALS I'VE EVER HAD! maybe it was the lack of sleep and the meth-comedown combo, but something clicked that night and I still do believe to this very day that i saw these people that would dissapear and that a had sex with some sort of being.
