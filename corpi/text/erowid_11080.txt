I started taking E in January, and in the past year, I've dropped maybe 15 times.  I couldn't even begin to tell you how awesome the first few Xperience were, but I noticed that the more I did it, the more it took for me to reach my euphoria, and the more I took, the harder I came down.  However, I found that if you drink a glass or two of milk BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER your experience, the hangover isn't as severe.  Triptophan (found in milk, turkey, and certain vitamins)is a key element here because it stabilizes the seratonin.  Also, knowing what you are consuming is important.  I would suggest buying a pill testing kit.  It could definitely save your life.  I found out that the first pills I ever took were full of PCP.
