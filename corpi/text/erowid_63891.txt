I have alot of experience with drugs, including IV coke and IV crystal meth.  But neither of those things were available to me, and I was looking to break the monotony of another friday of just being paid and nothing to do. I went to the store and bought a 6 pack of beer and 2 benzedrex inhalers.  Once home, I immediately took the top off both the inhalers, cut them into 8-10 small pieces, and took them with a glass of soda.

I started feeling a buzz as early as 15 minutes after i finished swallowing the pieces.  Kind of speedy, onset of MDMA body buzz.

Shortly after that, things went bad.  I was breathing hard, heavy, and fast.  I could feel my heart going insane in my chest, and there was an intense body fry associated with high fever / fast heartrate.  Euphoria had all but disappeared.  I layed down on the couch, feeling a sharp, grinding pain in my upper abdomen.  I lay there for a while, trying to get the pain subside, feeling the onset of a headache (caused by vasoconstriction).  After laying there for about an hour, I sat up and vomited violently.  I threw up for about 3 minutes, watching all the pieces of cotton fall from my mouth in a river of beer and bile.

Just be careful with dosage everyone.  Start small!  I never start small, and i paid for it with this one.
