I had been chasing heroin for about a year up until recently. I was put on a scrip to Subutex to aid me in getting off black (it really is a miracle cure). 

I've been 3 months clean and had 1 pill left and decided to see if it would have any effect since my opiate tolerance had diminished. I took the pill sublingually (disolving under the tongue as recommended).  

About 30 minutes to an hour later I began to feel the euphoric feeling I often get from freebasing heroin.  I was calm and felt really good.  About another 30 minutes later my skin began to flush, mainly in my face, and I started to get the rush I can normally get from a nice dose of opiates.  I then had dinner with my family.  I was kind of shakey, but not nervous.  I think I just felt so good that my nerves were kind of on end.  I continued to feel euphoric for another 3 or so hours.  My eyes were glassy and my pupils constricted quite a bit.  I felt as though I was smoking Black again.  

I went to bed and had trouble falling asleep.  Which I have never experienced with other opiates.  I was quite surprised in my experience.  I was not expecting it to be as intense as it was.  I almost wish I had a few more left over.
