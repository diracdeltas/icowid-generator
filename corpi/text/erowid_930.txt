When I heard that nutmeg could be psychoactive in certain doses, I decided to try it. I went to a spice store and bought about two ounces of whole nutmeg. Back at my house, I ground all of it up with a nutcracker and a cheese grater. I ate about two spoonfuls of the powder and made the rest into tea. While I was waiting for the tea to finish simmering, I started to notice that my limbs were getting heavier and I was pleasantly dizzy. It also seemed as though I was moving slower. After drinking all of the tea, I sat down and waited for whatever was going to happen. At this time, I started noticing that I could hear lots of different sounds, like the wind blowing or crickets chirping; sounds that you wouldn't normally notice. This time, however, they were really intense. The dizziness and slow-moving feelings also increased. After about an hour, things were staying about the same, so, disappointed, I went to bed (man, was I tired), thinking that all that was going to happen had happened already. Wrong. I woke up about an hour or two into my sleep, needing to go to the bathroom. When I sat up, my head felt like it was going to explode. It was very similar to using marijuana, except you get dizzy and slow, too. It was all I could do to get to the bathroom and back. I'm sure that I would have enjoyed it even more, had I stayed up for the onset of the REAL high. The next morning, I had a headache and still felt tired and slow, but the dizziness (high-ness) was gone. I felt fine by about noon. I would suggest using nutmeg when you know you can just sit and relax, preferably later on in the day.  At first, it seems like it's not working, but just wait a bit.
