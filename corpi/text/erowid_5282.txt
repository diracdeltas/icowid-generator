As I said in my previous report. I didn't get a 'special' kick out of my previous AMT experience. And as I told in my previous report, I had some AMT while writing the previous report.

After taking 30 mg of the substance. I immediately felt something. It could have been the bad taste of the substance, but I doubt it. After an hour, I was feeling a small, but not very rapid moodlift. It resembles the feeling of my other true psychedelic experiences, mostly with LSD. I felt itchy and maybe even a bit euphoric.

Two hours after having ingested the capsule with plenty of water I was feeling definitely something euphoric. There was not much visuals, but the psychic stimuli was undoubtful. This leads to another question, why my previous experiments weren't so successful? What went wrong?

Although, I tried to find some information about tryptamines and vitamins (a big thank to another 'local' who has some interest towards tryptamines) I didn't find anything special about their relations, which would have affected my previous experiences (negatively that is). I knew about B6 vitamin and it's relation what comes to producing melatonin, but that was it.

I guess, it was set and setting all the time. During my previous AMT experience I wasn't alone. That has usually affected my experiences with tryptamines (negatively, e.g. 5-MeO-DiPT). But I didn't have any idea it would affect in this (large) scale, because I was at home when I had my previous experience, too.

What comes to the symptoms of the substance, I must say, that it has a great affect to the general mood towards things. At least this time, it gave the (wanted) moodlift and euphoric feeling. Although, that wasn't the main goal, when I took this substance.
