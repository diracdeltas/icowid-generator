I was bored and broke so I checked the Erowid Vaults for something cheap that may alter my state of mind.  I am very familiar with cannabis and have dabbled with LSD, cocaine, ecstacy and shrooms, but nutmeg was a whole different game.

I made a huge milkshake with vanilla and chocolate ice cream and chugged it as quickly as I could (about 1/2 hour because of the taste) and I finished around 6 on a Saturday night.  Even with the ice cream and a little extra sugar, the grainy nutmeg was a liitle hard to swallow.

I wasn't really feeling anything so I just went to bed around 11.  

I was awakened at 2:30 by a great feeling of dizziness and I couldn't fall back to sleep so I got up and watched stupid infomercials and was completely engrossed.  One by one, my roomates came down to the living room because they were feeling the same effects.

The next 18 hours were some of the most amusing of my life.  Anyway, my roomates and I all experienced  the same effects- a certain amount of discomfort in the stomach, blurred vision, loss of equilibrium, extreme playfulness and a slight cloudy feeling in the head the next day.<!--I would definitely suggest nutmeg to any curious parties, but it is not something I would reccomend doing on a regular basis due to the horrible natural taste and effects on the stomach.-->
