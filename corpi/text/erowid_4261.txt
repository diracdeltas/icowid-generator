I absolutely love the effects of GHB.  Seriously, other than taking too much and passing out in the shower and waking up bruised, it was truly my panacea, my wonderous helper, kind to every living man and anyone else who would listen.

Then the supply of Verve dried up.  'No problem,' I thought to myself -- and quit at the absolute end of the bottle.  

I was a heavy, heavy user, going through about a bottle a week beforehand; the first thing that happened was I got extremely shaky, so much so that I had to excuse myself in meetings.  Shaking, shaking, highly embarrasing, plus there's more:  All this shaking added to the intense paranoia that the lack of Verve had produced, meaning that there I was, at work at 6pm, thinking that the boss was talking about me as I was shaking and stirring.  

The paranoia was extremely easy to believe -- at the time I had no idea what the rush of dopamine was doing.  It was like I was the lousiest director of my own scary movie.

No sleep was no sweat, I thought -- meaning that for about a week, I was a basket case.  

What helped:  Xanax, and lots of it.  Seemed to be the only thing that helped quiet down my 'Shakes the Clown' lurches.  I don't advise any alcohol, but some folks say that works as well, but to me that was subbing one addiction for another.

6 months later and I'm Finer Than Frog's Hair, and know this:  Should I partake again, I've got to be militantly diligent about dosing and recovery time.  Besides, it was getting too hard explaining where I got all the bruises...
