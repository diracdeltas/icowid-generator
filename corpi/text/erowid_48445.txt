For a very long time I knew something was wrong with me. I never knew what. I visited doctors, specialists, once I had a camera put down my throat to my stomach! Nothing helped, until my mother suggested I try a psychologist, who worked wonders in her own right (but that's aonther tale). 

The other thing that resulted was I was diagonsed with social anxiety and put on Paxil, 20 mg a day to start. Now, I never would've believe that medication could help me, but the difference was night and day. I made friends, I talked in school, I could even talk to girls.

Paxil changed my life in many postiive ways, and I never regretted going on it. That said, if you decide Paxil is right for you, DO NOT MISS DOSAGE. You will feel many unpleasant things, like waves of lightheadedness that will not disappear, you may get naseaua, and sorry fellas, but an erection could be tough in coming. And those infamous Paxil zaps? Oh, they exist, and they're like nothing you've ever felt. So, if you need help, it's worth considering, but you need a few relaxing days to go on and off, so be careful.
