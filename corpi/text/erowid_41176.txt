I've only recently stopped taking Effexor - weaned myself off quite rapidly, over the course of perhaps a week - and didn't experience any immediate withdrawal effects.  Now, a few days later, I am feeling vaguely drugged and euphoric.  I wouldn't consider it pleasant, as it's rather more persistent than I'd like, but it's sure not the hell that many people seem to describe.  If I could liken it to any other experience I've had, it's somewhat akin to being fairly drunk or stoned, but only for a tenth to a half of a second or so at a time, ten or fifteen times a minute.

It's a little disorienting, but it's a little interesting, too.  If I were experiencing this as a result of taking a recreational drug rather than ceasing a prescribed dose, I don't think I'd repeat the experience, but I don't think I'd consider it a loss.  The 'Effexor demon' has at least failed to conquer me.  It is a rather demonized substance, I think, as it's helped me a fair bit.
