Modafinil is a great substance when I<!--for college students or anyone who might --> need to stay up all night.  When I need to pull an all-nighter I usually take 200mg at around 12:00am and another dose every eight hours thereafter until eight hours before I plan on getting sleep.  The great thing about this drug is that, about four hours after ingestion, I feel like I have had sleep.  I can process information (such as studying, listening or talking) just like I would normally, if not better (one study on pubmed showed an increase in performance vs. control).  So, unlike traditional stimulants, I don't feel like I am in a daze after staying up 24+ hours. There is a very mild stimulation that helps to motivate one to study, but there is little recreational value to the stimulation. As well, it does seem to boost my mood a little, but again this is of little recreational value.  As for interactions, I am taking wellbutrin XL 150mg/day and lexapro 10mg/day and I do not notice any interactions besides a slightly higher propensity for anxiety; I asked my doctor and she said there is little to worry about except the aforementioned anxiety.
All in all, this drug is a great aid for but not recreational.<!--college students or even those in the business community but should not be taken for recreation.-->
