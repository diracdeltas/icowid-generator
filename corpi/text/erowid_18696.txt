First Ayahuasca Trip-
I acidified 16 ounces of water with citric acid and added 9 grams of chacruna (Psychotria viridis). I brought this solution to a boil then allowed it to simmer for 10 minutes. I ingested 3 grams of syrian rue seeds by placing the powdered seeds into a small shot glass, adding water, and drinking this liquid. 15 minutes later I ingested half of the chacruna solution. 

In 10 minutes the drug started to take effect. Only experiencing brief minor nausea, I began an extremely intense trip. I had to be in a very still and quite area. I layed down in my bed and the visions began. At first I saw many beautifull patterns with yellow and green colors. Many which looked like the pictures in depicted in plants of the gods. Suddenly I felt as though I couldn't breath. Everything turned black and I saw visions of snakes and demons. I cried for help as my girlfriend entered the room. I calmed down mildly. I began to explain how I wasn't living my life moraly and how much i wanted to change, how much i wanted to be close to jesus, and how much i wanted to be happy. After the intense visuals died down, i was able to talk about and reflect on the changes that where occuring in me. after about 30 minutes all the effects subsided. 

This experience was very powerful. It was very difficult to navigate this journey and it is difficult not to fall victim to a bad trip. Even though i spent 10 minutes in hell i feel that i learned alot. And i actually did enjoy the negative and horrifying aspects of this trip because i learned alot about myself and freed myself of much sorrow.
