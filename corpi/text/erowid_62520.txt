I thought I would write a repot on this combo since I haven't seen a report anywhere on it. I have tried this combo a couple of dozen times at different percentages. The most even I have found is 20% 5meo-dmt to 80% n,n,DMT. 

I usually smoke/vaporize 8mgs 5meo-dmt and 30mgs n,n DMT in 3 toke in 3 breaths. They seem to play and dance together like little kids playing during the peak sometimes it will be more like a n,n DMT trip and then in an instant it will twist around and flow into a 5 meo-dmt like experience with much more colors and depth. These twisting changing experiences are like a dance between the 2 chemicals it is very beautiful and vivid. They seem to feed off of each other and prolong each other, usually about a good 30mins I am immersed in the experience. 

I have also tried a larger percentage of n,n DMT in the mixture like 33mgs n,n DMT to 4mgs 5meo-dmt it was very nice, more like a n,n DMT experience but more dramatic and powerful. I have tried more 5meo-dmt in the mixture also which made it more like a 5meo-dmt experience but much more colorful, dramatic and easier to remember. A very nice combination.
