Well this is not the first time I've taken the wonder sleeping pill, but for me last night was definitely the last. The effects are obvious and they take on quick, seriously I peak at about the 30-45 min mark, with dream like sensations, 'its like a dream' anyways. I took 30 mg an hour later I fell on my face and cracked my beautiful front tooth! YES!!!! thanks ambien your the greatest
