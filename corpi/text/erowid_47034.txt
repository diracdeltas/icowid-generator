Around 11 o'clock last night I loaded the bowl of my little shotgun bong full of cigarette tobacco. I just got out of a three-hour long physics lab that stressed me out as usual. I was completely out of pot, so I thought nicotine would relax me just the same. I had taken tobacco hits in my bong before, but always with pipe tobacco -- the sticky stuff cut into flakes. It just gave me a euphoric feeling for a few seconds, which faded to a dream-like state, and then it was gone in about 30 seconds. Cigarette tobacco, however, is cut into strips, and burns much faster than the flakes and therefore releases the nicotine at a much higher rate. I didn't think about that when I loaded my oversized bowl full of the stuff. 

I sat at my desk in my dorm with my roommate next to me watching. I lit my bowl and took a huge hit. I probably sucked a cigarette's worth of tobacco in that single hit. I breathed out and there was no smoke (I have no idea where it went). At first, the feeling was all the same as before, just very relaxing. A few seconds later though, I got extremely dizzy and fell to the floor. I wanted to just pass out, but before I could, I got the most vivid headache ever. I seriously thought that my brain was boiling. All I could only hear the static coming from my head and the faint sound of my roommate asking if I was ok. I wanted to vomit, so I crawled to the bathroom with my head still screaming. I leaned over the toilet and drooled like a slobbery dog, but I didn't throw up. I drank some water from the sink, and by now the static sound in my head faded to a few intermittent 'pops'. I crawled up to bed and passed out. 

Now it's the following morning, and I still have the worst headache in my life. Please do not try this unless you want to experience hell for 10 minutes. Maybe in smaller amounts, a bong rip of cigarette tobacco might be good, but a bowl full of the stuff is disastrous.
