My previous drug experiences were with cocaine, marijuana, heroin, crystal meth, Ketamine, Ecstasy, LSD, DXM, and I smoke pot about 6 times a day.  Well, I'll skip right to the good part.  I crushed 110 seeds and mixed it with water and let it sit for an hour. This was at 8:30.  I then smoked 3 bowls of very high grade pot.  About an hour later, at 9:30, I smoked 3 more bowls of kind bud.  Note: my father was downstairs the whole time.  At 10:00 I went to bed to avoid any confrontation with my father. At about 10:30 I felt the trip.  All of a sudden I felt wide awake, so I laid in bed for an hour and just chilled. I saw some colors, I saw trails, it was very enjoyable.  At about 11:30 I was severely fucked up, so I decided to smoke some pot and get even more fucked up.  I was so high and the LSA hit me so nice.  I was in heaven.  

Well, I ended up falling asleep at 1:00.  I got up at 6:00 with a stomach ache.  The trip was still there.  I decided not to smoke any pot before school, to avoid the acid hitting me again (I always have bad experiences tripping in school).  I got to school with some residual effects from the LSA. I chilled throughout the day, came home and smoked a blunt.  And here I am right now, stoned as hell.  Actually, right now I have a better sense of well being.  WELL, ALL I HAVE TO SAY RIGHT NOW IS:  GO GET HIGH.
