To begin with, I had a therapist suggest Kava Kava as a method of relaxation.

One night, smoking bud, I decided to lace a few bowls.  I took some capsules I had of pure ground Kava root and broke them up on an old magazine.  Then I rolled each bud in the powder and sprinkled some on top of the bowl just to make sure.  Four bowls of really dank bud and kava later, I was on the most calm, relaxing high of my life. 

I've repeated this process numerous times now and very much enjoy the effects.  

The Kava seems to do three things:

1) It eliminates any chance of a paranoid high.  A calm euphoria sweeps the mind leaving me stoned AND at peace with the world.

2) It enhances creativity.  Kava/pot art is great.  Some how the high is more focused and expressive as opposed to being stoned stupid. 

3) It is maybe the best remedy for insomnia that I have ever found.  Sleeping on the two substances is relaxing on a different level.  Even my dreams tend to be better.

The only real drawback is, if I have good weed, having to taste the kava, too.  however, it seems to improve the taste of brick-weed.  Kava, when smoked, is not bitter, but more peppery, unlike the gross taste of drinking kava.

If I want to feel the effects more fully, I take some of the kava orally, too.  I take a few capsules before I smoke.  Hash is even more pleasent...I get a body high from hell when I combine all three...I intend to trip sometime with such a combination, hopefully.

Goodluck and kava pleasent dreams...
