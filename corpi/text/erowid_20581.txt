I found a bottle of Yohimbe capsuls, put out under the Natrol brand name.  I purchased the bottle yesterday and cracked it open last night.  My first suspicions were aroused by the fact that the bottle promised '500 mg' of Yohimbe bark per capsul - a rather larger dose than that with which others have reported results. Still, I took 1 of the capsuls at about 10:30 pm and settled down to see what happened, and remained settled untill about midnight.  I experienced absolutely nothing at all, and went to bed at 12:00 am bored and dissapointed, and quite able to sleep easily.  Being fairly positive actual Yohimbe bark is able to produce _some_ effect on _anybody_, I believe the Natrol brand simply contains little - if any - actual Yohimbe.  Better off buying the stuff in bark/powdered bark form from an herbalist/apothacary/Amazonian native, etc.
