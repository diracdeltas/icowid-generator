1st time.

My friend hooked me up with cocaine just before a show.  I did about 2 lines before & 5 more during.  Needless to say it was great.  I got home at around 3:00 and the effects continued until 4:30 after with I suffered the shittiest comedown I've had with any drug.  Until around 7:00 I was clawing at the sheets, gnawing my teeth and staring longingly at ceiling like the Gate Keeper.

2nd time.

Another club.  In the bathroom stall, I dumped a bunch of it on my lap, and the only way to stand up without losing da schtuff was to perform an act similar to giving myself head, but with my nose.  The result was too much too fast.  The rest of the evening I had to keep drinking water in order to be be able to swallow and my teeth felt like dentures (I ended up chipping one of them with a beer bottle).  I then had an anxiety attack and rushed to the bathroom stall where I found by nose bleeding and that I couldn't open my hands all the way.  Other than that ... euphoria.  I snuck out to avoid all the undercover cops who had surely been observing me all evening and I somehow lost them by taking a winding way home.

3rd time.

By this time I was convinced that coke was evil.  I had some left over, and I felt bad about tossing it and I had no one to sell it to, so I kept it around for a week or two.  The idea of having coke in the house haunted me for a while, so when I was bummed out over having to clean my room, I downed a line.  Beautiful.  No side effects, no comedown and one hospital-clean room.  I finished the coke one or two lines a day and eventually the whole house was sparkling and my mom wondered what had come over me, and whatever it was, where could she get some more?

Bottom line.

I have no yearning for more and I never think about it but if some turns up than I'm all the happier.
