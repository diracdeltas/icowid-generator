I have been prescribed Stilnoct, aka Ambien, 10mg as an aid for sleeplessness. In my past i have been injecting mostly amphetamines and opiates. I have made the common  mistake of trying to inject bensodiazepines. But a few months back I learned that zolpidem is water soluble, which made me interested. In theory it could be just like injecting bensodiazepines.

I washed the coating of the pill away and dissolved it in 1 ml (cc) of water and filtered it through an ordinary ciggarette filter.

The effect came on immediately and the effect was more like that of disassociatives, like a high dose of nitous oxide. Feeling totally disconnected from my mind. This effect passed away in a few minutes leaving a mellow, relaxed feeling. Maybe what 30 mg zolpidem taken orally would feel like. This state continued on for maybe 1 - 1½ hours after which I felt refreshed.

My opinion is that zolpidem IV was a nice waste of time, but maybe not so if the dose was considerably higher. The disassosiative effect when the IV hits might become scary if it´s more intense and prolonged.
