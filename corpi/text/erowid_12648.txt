I could only find one trip report on this combination, and it seemed to be a bad thing... but from my experiences on foxy and dxm individually, it seemed they would make a good combination.

   I took 10 30mg DexAlone pills, they were at one pharmacy, just one box out on the shelf, but they are just dxm.. heh, drove to the party so at T+40min. I ate the foxy, then I waited in line... started to feel a headchange, and get the euphoric body feeling from the dxm... i went down and danced it felt *great* to move, this was the DXM, eventually the foxy crept on in and everything started waving in my vision... this was at T+3 hours.. Mmy body felt incredible, for stretches I would just sit there lolling about, at the peak i couldn't stop from twitching and just slouching in these chairs and looking out over the dance floor 

    It was a great experience! for the most part, I could sit down and close my eyes and lose myself in the visuals, riding the music like a snowboard, the music was connected to the hallucinations flying at me somehow...  i could also just stand up and felt all floaty and euphoric, things were wavy, but i could still talk to people if I wanted to. so yes, a very good experience, the hangover wasn't all that bad either as Irecall...

   So yes, drugs definitely affect people differently.
