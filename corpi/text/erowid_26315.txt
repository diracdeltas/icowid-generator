I started weight training recently, to try to get in better shape, so I started to read on natural herbs, and 'safe' chemicals that could increase testosterone (initally hoping it would have the 'get bigger' type effects ones associate with anabolics/androgenics)

I did get bigger, but I later found out that during the first couple months of resistance training, one will have noticable gains in muscle mass anyways. The DHEA has not, to my knowledge, increased my muscle mass any more than if I didn't take it, BUT, it's not a complete waste of money as some say.

It is very useful, having noticable gains when taken. The increase in stamina also allows me to lift not only for longer amounts of time, but with a larger amount of weight.
