Tweakers 

I started experimenting with speed (ice) about a year ago, up to 2g/week for 7 months.  In within a few months it had positioned itself as the center of my universe.  It helped me out when I had lots of work to do, it motivated me, and kept boredom away.

Every time I ran out of things to do, I hit the pipe to pass time. Soon, it started to get expensive, so would buy a gram, sell half to a friend for double it's cost and do the rest for free. Here's the catch though...

Around here, it's not the most socially acceptable drug. And by selling a gram here and there, I pretty much advertised it. Word travels fast. Soon I found my friends treating me differently, some stopped talking to me, some just looked at me like I'm the biggest moron around.. At that point I had sunk down to socialising only with fellow 'enthusiasts'.  I was no longer a part of human society, in a way I had transformed into a different species... Tweakers.

This went on for a few months before I caught on to it.  But until then I had no idea that anything was wrong... Just a little confused about my friends. It took me another two months or so to get a hold of myself, I am still recovering.  Lots of damage was done.  It just takes time, and a strong will.
