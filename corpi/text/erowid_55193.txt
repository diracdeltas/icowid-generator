I have always been interested in having an opiate experience, but I am too chicken to go out and try heroin (which is a good thing). One night I got a hold a bottle of vicodin and decided to try the cold water extraction method. It was a pain but I pulled it off. I did it with 8 pills. I drank the solution and had a glass of red wine. Within 30 to 40 minutes a warm feeling came over me. By 1 hour I felt warm, fuzzy, and in a strange way, I felt like I was in love. I was giddy, happy and just felt very at peace. Jesus Christ, it was a great feeling. It lasted for over 3 hours. 

That the good part, but then came the bad part. I read a warning not to drink the solution. Well I discovered why. My stomach felt bloated and upset for almost 2 weeks after doing this. And then the strange itch that occured when I started coming down. Now I see why some say to let the solution dry into a powder and snort. Taking it orally was a bad idea, but I have no regrets, it was an amazing experience. However, I will probably never do it again.
