The recent years of my life have been greatly impacted by Ritalin. It all started out when I experimented with it because someone close to me got the prescription. I loved the way it made me feel. I'd get a great head rush and be very talkative,great mood, etc. Then comes the terrible come down. After snorting ritalin, which I've been doing frequently over years, the worst part is the come down. I go from the best mood ever, to great depression. Now I find myself addicted to this stupid drug, and it's really not worth it. I looked for just a boost to help me study or concentrate on exams, but now I'm doing it more frequently and in higher doses.<!--My word of advice is to not get into it.--> Ritalin seems nice for that hour or two I feel it, but it leads to addiction, and a hard addiction at that. I can't seem to lay off this shit, even though I see how pointless it is. I've read many other experiences about methylphenidate, and if one gets the point one will see it ends up all the same.<!--Smoke some weed or something instead, because you'll be better off.--> Thanks for listening, Peace
