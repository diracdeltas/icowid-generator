MY GOD! I just wanted to get to sleep tonight, so I did a line of Benadryl. I cut open a capsule and noticed that it was shiny and glittery lookin', like sugar and powered sugar mixed, but EXTREMELY fine.

5 min ago, I made 2 lines, half in each. I did one and I was is SO MUCH PAIN! it burns so much that I wanted to die right after it went up. I didn't even bother with the second pile, I just dusted it off and I have been snorting saline nose spray for the past minute straight.
