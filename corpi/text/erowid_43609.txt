Well to let you know I have tried many different types of experiences trying to find a great feeling. I've been smoking for about 2 years and never had a bad trip. I started trying nitrous by itself and absolutely loved them. The 10 second euphoria was better than most things I have tried.

One night my friends and I were having a party and started doing everything we usually do, but this time after smoking and getting to an 'elevated state' we decided to try nitrous. 

No Lie this was the best feeling I've ever had. My body seemed to fly up into space and twirl around seemingly moving very fast. Traveling to many different places disco rooms, water, and flying. The intense sensation was beyond good. After I started to settle down I was still left with a happy giddy feeling that made me simply explode with a sort of 'jolly' energy running around simply having a great time. I did a few more nitrous charges and were similar to the first all great sensations.
