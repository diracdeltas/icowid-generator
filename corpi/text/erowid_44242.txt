I would estimate about 20 years ago I went into a natural foods store and bought a tube of homeopathic belladonna tabs. A few days later a downed the whole tube. The immediate effects were feelings of irritation, ultrasensitivity to light, feeling the sun was extra bright and hot. I was downtown and it seemed that the tall buildings dwarfed me. No other distortions or hallucinations.
