I went and hung out with my friend S tonight.  I am still drunk while writing it.  I have drank before, much in excess of this, but this has got to be the most rewarding alcohol experience I ever had.  I went over to S's house around 7, and her sister M was there.  She went out and bought a six pack of Smirinoff Twisted.. green apple :) lol.. and she let me and S have two, and saved one for herself and one for her boyfriend.  Me and S quickly drank those two down in the period of 20 mins... and I did a double shot of vodka, and a shot of some schnapps  And S made a mixed drink.. vodka, peach schnapps, and some cranberry juice?  I dont know what she put in it, but it tasted great.  I had to leave in an hour, so I cut myself off and S's parents would be home in two hours, so her sister cut her off.  We went to the park.  I have been somewhat close to her, but the alcohol made it easier to open up.  I haven't seen her in a month or two, so I just wanted to see her, and the alcohol was a easily greeted suprise.  

But like I was saying, we went to the park by the end of her block.. and it was great.. it was getting dark, watching the sunset with my best friend in the world, just holding each other.  I couldnt ask for a better day.  We had deep talks about religion, her christian views, and my aithiest views, and we greeted each other views with an open mind.  It was great.  One of the best days in my life.  I know the alcohol is just used as a crutch right now to open myself up, and it will stop.  I am no stranger to addiction, with my father and two brothers and me fighting with addictions, both past and present.  But with the alcohol clouding my mind, I know this for sure, mine and S's connection will not be easily forgotten.
