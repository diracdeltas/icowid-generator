Lately I've been blessed with a friend who gets dilaudid 4's perscribed to her.  Most cats I know prefer the nasal route when abusing such narcotics, but me, always going for the gusto, I inject them.

Let me tell you, after you pull the needle out of your arm, you have about three seconds, then BOOM! the most wonderful thing has happened.  A warmth starts in the back of your head, then slowly (but not too slow) takes over your body.  It is the greatest thing I had ever expirienced, much better than a shot of good ole' street dope.

That is until it wears off. 

I started doing a half of a generic (white) 4mg dilaudid, and 2mg would be great, I'd be high for at least four hours.  As I started using it more though, the high would only stick around for a half hour or so.  Then I'd want another.  It's got to the point that I'll use 20 mg in the period of a few hours.  I get that initial rush, then its gone, and no other rush after the first of day is ever as good.  

I used to be able to abuse with little or no side effects the next day.  But now, the day after heavy usage I feel lethargic, sick and just unable to communicate with the outside world.  I'll lay in bed, feeling sick and sorry for myself.  'What have I done?'  I'll ask myself, wondering if these are the first signs of a healthy addiction (well sure it is).  

I have a crummy needle connection, so I'll stick with the same one over and over, also leading to nice marks on my forearm that sort of let everyone else in the world know I'm an outcast, a junkie.  Why the other day I was in extreme pain getting a boil on me arse lanced, and the doc refused to perscribe a descent painkiller, because of the marks on my arm.

So I am left with this?  A habit? oh hell.  Have I been blessed, or condemned?
