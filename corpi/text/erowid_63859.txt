Its not the actual drug that I end up wanting more of, it's the uninhibited, anything goes, environment created while on it. 

My husband and I tried it for the first time last summer out of bordum. WOW!!!! We spent the entire first night talking about things we'd never discussed before without fighting, we forgave each other for old grudges, and basically dove deep into parts of our selves we never new existed! It was so amazing that we did it again the next night. Same thing again!!! After a crazy weekend of no sleep, we felt like we had figured out all marriage problems and had fallen in love all over again. 

When next friday came we knew it was time to try it again, and use the extacy for what it was meant for!!! Oh Yeah. We continued doing it every weekend for a couple of months, but it just lost its euphoric effects and ended up giving us gut rot.

Only bad side effect was being really tired all week from not sleeping all weekend. I also felt really dehydrated on Monday.<!--, but hey it sure does accentuate those abs!!-->
