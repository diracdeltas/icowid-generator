I haven't had a good supply for a while so my tolerance is down.  Never the less I was blown away by the strength of poppy pods I purchased today from a nation wide fabric/craft chain.  I had heard about poppy tea and I was interested for a variety of reasons.  

First of all quality narcotics are hard to come by.  I do not enjoy doctors or nosey pharmacists meddling in my business.  Since I am loath of dealers legitimate medical sources have been my only means of procurement.   The other problem is that I have never perfected extraction so I have wasted a lot and have ingested large amounts of unwanted hepatoxic acetaminophen in my pursuit of a buzz.  

Until today.  I ground the pods (3 large) and made the tea by the instructions readily available on the internet.  I did choose to add the juice of a lime to the mash. I did this because the release of the alkaloids in the presence of the acid lime juice made sense to me. I drank it at 11:00 am, it is now 3:30 pm and I am still quite buzzed.  Classic opiate high.    

The taste is not that bad and the lime juice helped.  I considered the unpredictability of plants and potency.  It occurs to me as a clinician that this could be dangerous shit in the hands of an opiate naive person.  I was quite high and I can tolerate a lot.
