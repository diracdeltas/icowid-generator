I made a Sinicuichi extract called a 'water based extraction'.

I took about 1 ounce of the Sinicuichi leaves that I ordered off of well known ethogentic site. I then put all the leaves until a pot of covered the leaves with water--I then proceeded to squeeze the leaves profusly until the water turned a green/brown like color--I made very sure that EVERYTHING was squeezed out of these Sinicuichi leaves until nothing was left to squeeze out. I then let the pot simmer slowely until all the water was evaporated.

I was left with a sticky brown/green like goo on the bottom of the pot, I proceeded to scrape off the goo with a razor blade and put the goo onto a plate for it to dry. I let the extract dry completly and totally until it was hard and not sticky at all anymore (this may take up to a day or even more)

Simply loaded the Sinicuichi extract into a pipe/bong/whatever and simply smoked a realitvly small-medium bowl.

Effects were excellent--much better the canabis, along with slight visuals of pulsating colors, open and closed eyed visuals. This substace was excellent and I will be buying 5oz next time to make more extract--Sinicuichi was a very worth while and wonderful experiance that can even be smoked recreationally.
