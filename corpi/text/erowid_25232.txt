I have been drinking for regularly for about 10 years now. At first it was alot of fun. I remember drinking for the first time with friends. It was fun, it made me feel grown up and I liked the way it made me feel. Me and my best friend Garry would save all our lunch money from school over a week and get his older brother to buy us a bottle of Jim Beam. It became a regular thing to do, every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night we would get drunk. Over the years my resistance to alcohol has gained in strength. I am now able to consume at least 2 bottles of Jim Beam over the course of a 12-14 drinking session without getting sick ( mind you I am extremely drunk ), and my hang overs are that bad in the morning.

But when I drink now I lose control of my mind. I have absolutely no care for consequence or my self. I become a person that I'm not. In the past year I have smashed my $10000 car into a tree (drunk driving), been put on a good behavior bond for assault, lost my girlfriend of 3 years, lost my drivers license for driving down the footpath and into a mall nearly running over a security guard all the while yelling out the window that it was ok for me to be there because I was a stunt driver and nearly lost my job, all because of my problem with drinking. It really isn't fun anymore like it used to be. I have recently decided to quit drinking all together, and have started attending AA meetings. Hopefully I can overcome this terrible affliction.
