Today I've tried meth. Past few months have been hectic, I've tried lots and lots of stuff I wouldn't even consider doing just 6 months ago, but that's a different story. 

My friend prepared it for me, he was already amped himself, so I guess I took most of the hits from 3 bowls. I was kind of surprised, I thought meth would taste like coke or ecstacy, like a drug or something, instead the white smoke tasted weird. It had something of a plastic burn to it. Not very strong taste though. So I inhaled while doing the thing, then let it all out, I was asked to do it slowly. For some reason people liked the white dense smoke very much. 

First, I feel it coming and weird, then I start talking basically non-stop. I felt confidence, stamina, no way to fall asleep, 1.5-2x heart rate. After a while my body started feeling odd, I wasn't sure (like on coke comedown) whether I was tired, or still had huge reserves of energy. Meth tricked my body into believing I had that energy, when in reality I didn't. 

Many hours after smoking it, at some point, my pulse was 88. Now, the weird thing, I tried to fall asleep, didn't work, went to take a piss (you have a bad dry mouth on meth, I drank a lot, not as much as on e though), and decided I should measure my heart-rate again. However, this time around, over 30+ mins after last 'take' (and hours past the smoking) it jumped to a relatively whopping 126. This was a big surprise to me, because I don't exactly see how it could have jumped so high, afterwards. I would much rather see it at 135 or something, then 30 mins later at 126 then 88 to 126 - that's just wrong.

I am sitting here, can't fall asleep, and now I don't think I want to try again. Before I tried the first time I took about 2 shots of 40% rum.. I thought it'd help me, but I don't see the difference. I didn't find this really worth it.
