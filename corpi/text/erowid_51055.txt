drunk on xanax

First off I have had many drug experiances. I came home after a pretty shitty day and decide to take 1.5m of xanax (not my first time to do this either. I took 1.5m of xanax I had laying around and immediatly started on my beers. About 40 minutes later I feel like I drank a fith of liquor. I can't see straight and cannot type fast. I feel great and my worries of the bad day are gone, like 'oh well ill take care of it tomorrow.' very relaxed. Then I snorted .25m of xanax and it really didnt do what eating them probabaly would have done but it made me really sleepy. Good drug if I want to forget the day or save alcohol. Like I said I drank 3 beers and I fell like I've had 8-9. Nice relaxing drug. I'm going to go listen to music now, and then pass out. You people be careful and dont overdose. Peace.
