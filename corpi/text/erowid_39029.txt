It was a Friday night last week, a little get together with 4 people to have a good time. I'm 17 and have done marijuana since I was 12 numerous times, have done acid 3 times and mushrooms only once. We had done 2 dollar a hit acid, and taken 2-3 hits of that. This night we got very good acid, 5 dollars a hit, 275 ugs per hit. I talked to my friend Z and asked him to get us not only that but 1/2 an ounce of mushrooms for us 4, 1/8 apiece. I had 1/8 of kind bud and we planned on having a crazy weekend. We intended on taking the acid Friday night, then the mushrooms early Saturday morning then going to a party Saturday night, it didn't quite work out that way. 

   We took 1 hit of the acid and then smoked 4 bowls in Zs new glass piece at 8 oclock. A half hour after the first hit we took the other hit of acid and smoked 2 more bowls, to make sure we were chill and didnt do anything too crazy. An hour and a half after the first hit of acid, we were really stoned and it hadn't kicked in yet, Z said it might not have been real acid so we decided to take the 1/8 of shrooms. Big Mistake.

   We ate the shrooms and saved the crumbs for the next day to lace with weed. We decided we had best smoke some more weed because the acid could have a little effect, so R rolled us a pretty big joint, about a gram in it. So we were incredibly chilled, and about 30 minutes later it kicked in. I expected the shroom effect I had before, but it was unlike the shrooms or the acid I had taken in the past. The colors reminded me of mushrooms, but the crazy thoughts in my head and the shaky environment told me right then and there that the acid was indeed coming into effect. It had been 2 hours since the first hit of acid.

   I looked over at R and he wasn't doing too hot, he was curled up in a ball on my bed staring at the floor. He kept muttering something like, 'I can't fall. I just can't fall'. It's gonna get me. So we decided to smoke some more of the weed seeing as to how he was having a bad trip. That idea was even worse. I looked at the bowl and it was looking kind of funky, I couldn't get the flame in the bowl to spark the weed. I decided to just give up and let R smoke the whole thing, Z and A agreed with me. He picked up the bowl and threw it against the wall, and yelled out, 'Oh my god, what the fuck is wrong with you guys! Are you trying to kill me!' Luckily the bowl didnt break.

   It had been about 3 hours since the first hit of acid, and the shrooms and both hits of acid were in effect. I kept seeing people walking in and out of my room, I told one of them to get the fuck out and he turned around and his face was that of a demon. It was one of the scariest things I had ever seen in my life. He looked at me and said, if you want your family to stay alive you will shut the fuck up and go to bed, so I tried by damndest. I was on the floor face down, with my eyes closed. With shrooms I had seen smilie faces and such, and with acid I had seen colors, but oh, not this time. All I could think of was what he said, and there were flames and screams. I couldnt get it out. Obviously the weed had not done much, even though we smoked most of the 1/8. I can only imagine what it must have been like if I didn't smoke the weed.

   It was about 4 and a half hours since the first dose, we had taken 550 ugs of acid, 1/8 (3.5 grams) of mushrooms, and 2.5-3 grams of weed. I was still on the floor scared shitless. I looked at R and he wasn't doing to hot at all. Z had done acid some 2 dozen times, shrooms about 15, he seemed to be handling it quite well, so he was talking to R and trying to calm him down. He was enjoying his trip, and decided it would be good to give R a bowl of his weed, he didn't say what it was, but it was stronger then KB. He held the bowl and sparked it for him, but he didnt want to smoke it. 

   At this point it got really foggy. It was 5 hours into it, and I remember stuff at about 7 and a half. I start remembering stuff at me being in my car, scared shitless of the demon faced people inside that want to kill my family, and on top of that (I'm not sure what happened in that 2 and a half hours) I thought that everyone turned into werewolves and wanted to kill me. Z had managed to get R in bed and chilling, A was in my room with him. A was sketchy, but not as bad as me or R, Z was actually enjoying it. He went out on the roof and was staring at the sky talking about how beautiful it was. 

    At about 9 hours, I stopped tripping badly. I had vomit on my shirt and had peed my pants (at least that's what it smelled of). I went inside my house, still tripping pretty hard, and found R asleep and A and Z on the roof. I went up on the roof and they looked at me kind of funny, I told them that I wasn't having a bad trip, they were talking to each other and chilling and I joined in. We stared up at the stars and chilled. At about 11 hours the sun was coming up (7 in the morning) and we were still tripping. We went inside and put on The best of the Grateful Dead and laid back. R woke up and was tripping, but he was better (as in he was not having a bad trip) We talked and chilled, staring at my posters of the beatles and method man, and they would come out of the posters and sit next to me and start talking to me. Method Man has a blunt in his mouth in my poster, and we were passing it around. 

   At 18 hours it was 2 in the afternoon and we started to come down. We all took a nap on my floor, woke up at about 6-7 and didn't go to the party, we were coming down from everything still. We had about 4 bowls of weed laced with shrooms crumbs. We each did a bowl apiece and weren't tripping very hard, but were so happy and stoned. We put on soul plane, then half baked, then idle hands and could not stop laughing. We were crying rivers and it was great. At about 32 hours (4 in the morning) we were coming down from the weed and shroom crumbs, and went to bed. 

   The first 9 hours of my trip was incredibly horrible, I never want that to happen again. I loved it later on, I will probably do it again but with only 1 hit of acid. I strongly advise anyone intending on doing shrooms and acid to think it over twice, It's rough if you're not up to par.
