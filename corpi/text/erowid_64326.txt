It started out as a kind of what the hell ever experience involving a possibly little known idea called 'Ambi-Tripping'.  I'm still up on it right now smoking cigarettes while my friend is fiendishly attempting to play himself a themesong on his guitar for the whole night.  At roughly 12:30 AM on the 10th of June of this foul year, we came into a pile of 12.5Mg Ambien CR pills.  It wasn't until that exact moment we decided to take them.  I took 5 of them and immediately ground them down to remove their controlled release mechanism, and then crushed, shlashed, and and blade-pureed them into powder to be snorted so that i could insufflate them.  My friend did a similar thing but only consumed them on top of a tasty beverage.  

All things went well minus the unnecessarily disgusting drip 

(I am no fan of drips, so i went to the bathroom and inhaled water for a second since beer wouldn't take through the straw).  Myspace occurred, and we all know of the random mundane things that happen there. Ha.  If only we got that far.  Short story shorter.  Ambien takes simple tasks, adds a dramamine style hallucination, xanax style pull, codone style body load and the come down of the best portabellums ever.<!--A must for any one wanting a simple escape from big pharmas insistance on retrograded uplifted mass infringed bullshit infused stupidity. --> thank you.
