There is a new drug that contains only DXM hbr as an active ingredient.  it's called Zicam 'oral cough suppressant spray'(3.3 mg dxm hbr per spray), and Zicam 'oral cough suppressant spray night time'(6.0mg dxm hbr per spray).  There are 100 sprays per bottle, so each bottle is an average recreational dose for either your light user with the regular bottle (330 mg), or your heavier user with the night time bottle (600 mg).  I have tried this personally and found it to be much better than any pill form I have tried.  I took both the 300mg dose with medium effects and mild visuals, and the 600mg bottle with very stong effects and visuals.  I sprayed the entire contents of the bottle (like a binaca bottle, with no propellant) into a shot glass and took it like a shot, then chased.  Effects began to emerge after 30 mins, and steadily increased until peak at T+1:40 mins.  Duration was probably 8 hours.
