Well, to start of I'd say that I'm not a big opiate fan, got alot of friends hooked and never had urge to try it. I was out of pot but had a half bottle of vodka. I started drinking then I remembered I had two T-3's (30mg's a piece of codeine). I took them at around 10pm and drank the bottle. About 30 mins later I started to feel a little different.

Then I started to scrape my pipe I've had for a while, and I got a really phat resin ball. I smoked it then, WOW, It hit me, a completley different high! It was pretty great, completely relaxed, mentally clear, and really gone at the same time! I was gone for about three more hours. Really good high no nausea or anything and I was on empty stomach.
