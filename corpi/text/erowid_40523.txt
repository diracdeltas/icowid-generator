I was admitted to the hospital last year after an overdose of dxm.  I was a given a blood test and I tested positive for pcp.  I denied the use of pcp and was tested again and I tested positive again for use of pcp.  I have never used pcp nor had I done any other drugs within a month of this overdose.  I told the doctor that I had taken robotussin cough medicine and that I had calculated my dose dxm at 900mgs.  He told me the next day that he believed that I hadn't used pcp and that he thought it likely that because of the large dose I had taken did cause the positive test results for pcp.  He informed me that it worked on the same receptors as pcp and other similar substances.
