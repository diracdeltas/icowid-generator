I packed what seemed like a couple good hits in a thumbsized bowl of my soapstone handpipe, went into my bedroom, closed the door and sat on the edge of the bed. This time I was determined to see what this stuff REALLY was all about. I took a good puff, held it in and released it, then drew another. I sat the pipe down, laid back on my pillow ans let it all out. 

As I realized that the 'reality' of my room had disappeared, what I can only describe as a half man-half black leopard stepped up in front of me, reached out and sunk his foreclaws into my collarbones. Immediately he proceeded to spin me in a clockwise direction, spinning around several times as though we were waltzing until he stopped in my previous position and his claws were now MINE and were grasping the retaining bar of a highspeed rollercoaster rushing downward.

My head kept turning to the right, still trying to spin clockwise as though I was being compelled to look at him, who was sitting next to me with his claws on my hands. At THIS time, however, I was actually trying to look to the front to get an idea of where I/we were travelling. As I tried to look left, resisting the rightward spin, time seemed to reverse and the black leopardman was in front of me again, this time backing off and basically transforming into a multicolored fractal pattern and the, ummm, 'reality' of my room reappeared... I checked the clock and only about 4 minutes had elapsed.
