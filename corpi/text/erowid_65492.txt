I had just ingested 3 grams of cubensis put on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. My close friend George was my "sitter" for the trip to follow. After I ate the sandwich (which did well to mask the unattractive flavor of the fungus) we sat in my room and talked for a good 30-45 minutes while I waited for it to take off. While we were talking I gazed over at my Scream painting by Edvard Munch. I noticed the glowing colors and the screaming man's arm seemingly come out of the frame and towards me. The screaming man's eyes and mouth continually changed shape and size displaying different emotions every second. I broke out in uncontrollable laughter, George laughed and told me I should be a bit quieter since my parents were sleeping downstairs, so I said okay.

I then stood up noticing that the carpet beneath my feet which was a white/gray color had begun to overlay its own image on top of its self and shift in different directions creating water that was approximately 4 inches deep. I told this to George and slowly began wading through it. I then glanced at the turtle green section of wall between my two closets and saw that the wall was slowly changing state between convex and concave, the wall was breathing. After staring in awe and appreciation of the living world around me I sat in a knee-chair in the corner of my room and looked at my ceiling which then broke off in to five separate segments and began spinning in a circular motion alternating at each segment. One being clockwise the next counterclockwise etc.

I then looked at a piece of paper upon which I had done lettering for a band I was in called "Engorgement" the sharp, curved protrusions which emerged from the lettering began to move like a chainsaw. I then stated to George that I would like to eat the letters. He told me it was a good idea. So I put the paper in my mouth for a moment and had my first experience with synesthesia stating it tasted like lilacs, like the color purple. He laughed at this as did I, for the overwhelming sense of joy and euphoria I was experiencing could not be matched by anything I had previously known. Afterwards I sat down on the floor by my guitars thinking a number of different abstractly logical thoughts as my mind raced through the deepest reaches of outer and inner space. I then saw something which I had never dreamed possible… my room had become the Sahara Desert. The windswept dunes and warmth called me over to them. I crawled over to my bed and began feeling the smooth, curved, flowing dunes and wished the experience would never end. 

I lay there on the floor for a while as my mind reeled and I was taken to an Aztec temple and formed into it's ancient stone walls. I was approached by three of them, one carrying a lance-like weapon. I knew immediately I was part of their ritual, I would be sacrificed to the sun so that they may have a bountiful harvest. During the trip and especially during the ritual, I experienced intense time dilation in which minutes had felt like centuries and I believed I had been around since the beginning of time. I felt the lance-like object plunged into my spine and sensed a gorgeous beam of sunlight filling the hole. I was not upset or scared, I was part of something beautiful. Then as they Aztecs left the temple my fingers began growing an enormous amount and become part of the ground. My fingers had transformed into an irrigation system for them. 

After my duty had been fulfilled I walked back over to the chair and sat in it staring deeply into my lava lamp seeing as how it was so beautiful and warm that must be how the universe was heated. George asked me if I would like to see how it was with the lights turned off, so I gave him the ok. And as the room darkened a place I had never seen before. The universe and all of its planets, galaxies, stars, nebulas and wormholes stared into my soul. I laughed a laugh of extreme jubilance and was floored by this. I looked out my window at the night sky and it's joyful purple glow. When I was done I told George it was okay to turn the lights back on, so he did. I took note of my bed sheets of which had a diamond shaped pattern that was a direct portal to the sun and all things benevolent.

I looked over at the painting again and saw the man's (who I had named Timothy, due to the "O" shape of his mouth and the need I felt to give him a name, one with an O in the middle of it.) mouth coming toward me attempting to devour my soul. I told Timothy he could not have it, he then ceased his efforts. I went over to Edvard Munch's painting to study it further. The layers of colors he had painted and the way they interacted with each other gave me reason to believe that he had been inspired by a spiritual force, for no one could paint something that reacted so well with the mind during the psilocybin experience. The edges of the colors glowed, while the reds and oranges were intensely warm and welcoming. The blues were a cool soft comfort. And all the colors in the foreground separated from those in the background. The foreground had a wonderful quality which made it seem as though it hovered slightly above the background. Meanwhile the background had a pearlescent quality that shimmered and moved fluidly across the painting as though the water was real. The water then began to come out of the painting and I felt it with the tip of my pointer finger… it felt like actual water. I then proceeded to walk back over to my closet where I lay down and played with miniature ocean tides that put me at a sense of ultimate peace as I watched the paneling around my closets converge on a point in time.

I went back over to my guitars (by this time George was now sleeping.) I stared at the candy apple red bass and plucked the E string, hearing the Om or sound of creation. As I lay there I came the conclusion that if I were to stop breathing the universe would fold in upon itself and all living things in it would die. I stayed there for a bit and decided to look myself in the mirror. As I did a most intense process of self-analysis began as I gazed into my pupils and saw my soul. A process which I felt I was not ready for, so I stepped away from the mirror and went to the bathroom to urinate.

As I re-entered the room George woke up and asked me where I had gone. I told him I simply went to the restroom. He then told me how relieved he was for he had thought possibly I went downstairs or was getting in trouble of some sort. After this I told him I was ready to sleep for it had been many years in that night and I had to get up in the morning and see a girl. He threw me my pillow and I lay on the floor staring out the window into that purple night sky feeling an undying euphoric sense of peace with everyone and everything and faded off into sleep.
