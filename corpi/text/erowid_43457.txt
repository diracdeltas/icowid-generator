Crack is Evil

I just went on a death journey. meaning I tried to kill my self. I have done every drug known to mn kind except Crack cocaine. I have heard many evil hingd about it but decided since I had a reputable source or three I would go for a 5 day binge. I'll first tell you it is more mellow and predictable than   powdered ocaine. After smoking crack I get a feeling of very well being which only lasts bout 20 minutes top. With powdered coccaine I get a long aganizing journey that usually ends around an hour or so if I am lucky. I appreciate crack for the simple fact that I know what I am getting and powder fucks my nose up and can be a bit of a hassle trying not to spill it and such.<!--I want you that have not tryed Crack cocaine to do so quickly, for it blows away powder forms with a redeeming quality of a fine lady in her finest threads.--> Crack is the new drug of choice for me because it's so easy to control the intake and powder I just don't know what it's cut with and what a waste as I usually need shite loads of xanax to come down off of it. So long live Crack and fuck powder unless.<!-- into agony and being ripped off by the cut factor. --> Peace and long live my heart so that I may discover more Crack highs.
