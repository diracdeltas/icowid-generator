I took 10 drops sublinquily of Dmae H3, 3g Syrian Rue, and 5g of dried Psilocybe Mushrooms.  I took the Dmae H3 2 hours into the trip and it seemed to help me think clearer and better and faster then I was with just the Rue/Mushroom mix.  There was only one problem though with this combination, I received a Headache (which lasted not too long maybe about 30 minutes to and hour).  A tension headache.  I normally get headaches with Dmae H3 alone anyhow if I take too much and always the same type of headache (in the back of the neck tension type headache).  I also am very sensetive to smart neurochemicals anyway.  If you are sensitive towards Smart Neurotransmitters also as I am then watch out with this combination.  I don't think it's too smart anyhow to mix anything with Mao Inhibiters (except for maybe some Tryptamines) so just watch out.
