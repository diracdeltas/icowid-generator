From experiences with ecstacy over a six year period (im 22 now) its is evident that more you take on a regular basis the worse the experience. What im trying to say is, there was a stage where i was taking in excess of 8-10 pills per day, mainly during the evening at clubs and friends houses. It may sound a lot however i managed this for no more than about three weeks, as it took over my whole life - it seemed i was chasing the buzz the whole time, when i couldnt catch it i would roll over into a state of non-sleep but not being awake either. On a come-down it was easy to realise that this wasnt the same as the first time i took the drug, back then when i took my first pill it was like floating in heaven, while during that period it was more stress and fighting to get myself 'up'! It was a hard cycle to break (but it can be done) I decided to lay off to a month, i actually managed to go five weeks before taking the drug again...

I arranged to go to a good club with lots of friends and saved myself for that night, i double dropped seeing as i was already used to the drugs and their effects, it was great! I did however take one more in halves to keep the high for that bit longer.. Now i dont take the drug that often, the most i do is say 12 pills in a month, still a lot but far better than the same amount in two days!

To conclude i'd say that with most things you should place limitations on how many you allow yourself to do and the time periods you do them in, remember its not a game to see who can do the most - as that will only end with you both losing, and maybe losing more than just the game. 
Two more quick bits, please only buy from people you trust (another personal experience) and watch you hydration levels!!  Take care! Mx
