The first time I smoked up, it was giddy happy stupidity.  I loved the way it felt.  So I began smoking up.  At first it started at about a nick a week.   Then it turned into a dime a week.  Then I got access to a really good dealer, and since then, I have been smoking like a 20 a DAY.  I am only 16 now, and I have been smoking for 4 years.  It used to be a wonderful occasion; being stoned.  But now its jes my normal state of mind.  Even worse, I have noticed that I BARELY feel the effects, the slightest hint of being high whenever I smoke.  Its not horrible, but just not nearly as fun as when I first smoked up.

Often I ask myself if its worth it, continue smoking.  I ask it almost every time I have this disgusting hacking coughs from breathing too quickly.  Whenever I breathe its like my lungs r half full.  I can still think ok, but just not as well as I could b4, and I sometimes have trouble recalling little facts, I can always remember them if I think hard enough though.  

I am just saying weed does change, the whole experience.  It only gets to be a duller, and a more repetitive lifestyle.  Not being high is fun too, and if u continue to smoke, u just don't appreciate things as much when ur normal.  If u go to a great dinner, in a normal state of mind, often u think, this would taste so much better if I was stoned.  If ur doing a fun activity, often u just say, 'this would be so much cooler if I was stoned.'  

Its a lifestyle I can live.  But soon I am just gonna take a break for a few years and let my tolerance go down, and so I can learn to appreciate the normal state of mind once again.  Weed isn't a nightmare, but not a good dream either.
