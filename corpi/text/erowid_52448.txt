I heart meth

I remember it like it was yesterday. The first time i took a hit of meth my body was thrown into a state of euphoria. I loved life. I knew, somewhere in the back of my mind that it would not always be this good but dam, this was the best feeling on earth. As I started to come down I had a bad crash and I wanted my happy feelings back so I called for some more. After repeating this cycle another 3 times i woke up 2 days later with no money. But i still want more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
