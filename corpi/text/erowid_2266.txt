I've tried six times the recommended dosage of 'dream herb' on the bottle, with no noticeable effects whatsoever (I took it before going to sleep).  It's still a great company according to many people whose messages I've read, though......I guess it's a matter of knowing which items to get.  Their San Pedro is probably worth trying.
