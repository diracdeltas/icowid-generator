Salvia

Other additives to the divinorum experience that seem to enhance the effects can include passionflower (harmaline), linden flower (also harmaline?), papaver somniferum extract, and the like. Any novices to Salvia divinorum should use great care, especially if smoking is the chosen manner of usage--a single inhalation can sometimes be of considerable effect.
