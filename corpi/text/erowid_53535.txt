The first time I took shrooms was quite the experience.  First off, I definitley took a bit more than I probably should have.  Second, I took them at the mall.  Thirdly, a majority of my trip was in a dark movie theater.  All in all, probably a bad combination.  However, though my trip was completely bugged out, it was certainly life changing.  At first, I said to myself, 'What a bad trip.'  But the more I thought about it, the more I wanted french fries.  No I'm kidding.  The more I thought about it, the more I realized it really wasn't a bad trip.  I was just really awesomely revealing.  I actually remember my friend saying 'I think I'm going to kill myself,' and I totally understood.  But that was kind of just a meaningless statement.
