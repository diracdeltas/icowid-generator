Coffee Break

 I've been drinking about 4-6 cups of coffee a day as opposed to my usual 2-3. After a week of this I've been having breathing troubles. My lungs and such are perfectly clear even though I'm an avid cannabis user. My breathing is not fully satisfactory and this is most likely because of my racing heart. I've got the shakes a bit too and unnecessary anxiety. I was told this would wear down in a few days but until then I find I cant smoke cannabis anymore because it makes my body feel too relaxed while my heartbeat is still racing, putting more focus on my unsatisfactory breathing. Caffeine is a drug and is more harmful then in my experience, more harmful then cannabis.
