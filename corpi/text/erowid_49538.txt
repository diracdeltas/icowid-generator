My mescaline journey started after four days of almost no sleep. We had decided to pack up every psychedelic I can think of and went to the woods. The last day after eating 6 white on white blotters I discovered my acid tolerance was too much to really trip. So I did what anyone would and got drunk and went to find some mescaline. After about an hour a had obtained a couple 440 mg pills of pure mescaline. I went back to my camp and ate one. The come up was harsh almost jet rocketed by the acid. I collapsed on the ground screaming that some hippie had sold me pcp. Someone threw a blanket on me and I watched imaginary indians dance around the fire. Then it happened I started vomiting and when I stood up it was on. I was off wondering in the woods. Tripping nuts I had very few visuals but I was tripping my fucking nuts off. Eventually I got scared to be outside and sat in my tent for a long period of the trip until I passed out. When I came to I was still tripping hard and continued to trip for 26 hours total. I am not sure what happened to the cool visuals I may of had a cross-tolerance to the ectasy or mushrooms I had eaten the previous morning.
