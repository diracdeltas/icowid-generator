Im 18yr old male student been smoking weed for several years, done long list of different substances including shrooms, ayahuasca, salvia.d and many others but only recently started experimenting with several research chems.. Actually I had started using them way too often and wanted to cut down my use of research chems (and other drugs too) and decided i needed a good kick in the butt which this trip was supposed to give.

I started by chewing & swallowing ~2grams of peganum harmala seeds that had been sitting around on my locker for a while. At first I was supposed to trip only on 5meo-dmt but few days earlier i recalled i had small a amount of harmala left with leftovers of mimosahuasca from my previous ayahuasca sessions.. i´d estimate there was somewhere between 5-10g worth of root bark in the potion. Anyways after 30mins from chewing the gross tasting seeds I downed the mimosahuasca and it was easier than I had expected: downing the liquid is always an effort for me because im not really the fan of mimosahuascas stomach-acid like taste, usually it makes me dry heave but this time I had no problems and took it down in 4 shots inside 10 minutes.. I was in great mood and continued by putting 15-20mg´s of 5-meo-dmt under my tongue and damn that stuff really burned! 5 minutes more and i swallowed all the evil tasting saliva from my mouth with some good juice.. I decided I still didn´t have enuff drugs in my system and snorted the last 3-6mg 5-meo-dmt that were still on the cd-case, now all the tryptamines were in my system and I cleaned up my place a lil bit to make me feel comfortable and sat down to prepare myself mentally for a trip that was no doubt going to step in soon enough.

It was now ~50 minutes since i had taken the seeds and 10 minutes since i had snorted the last bits of 5-meo-dmt and I was playing around with my computer making good winamp playlist selecting allkinda trippy music from many genres (ie. bob marley, astral projection, shpongle and many others..) while I was making the list I could DEFINITELY feel the tryptamines starting to kick in, my vision was getting blurred and I was feeling spacey and light headed.. thanks to mild visuals and blurred vision I couldn´t read anything on the computer and decided it was too much to look at and moved myself to a sofa where I could enjoy the trip. The beginning really reminded me of ayahuasca with lots of mild visuals & the headspace feeling & waves of colors going past my vision sometimes. But this was still different from huasca and I could tell 5meoDMT was stronger of the tryptamines in my head now. I loved the mixed feelings of both tryptamines and felt very euphoric and floaty while just letting my thought flow.. Had some deep insights and revelations and just felt great all around.. 

There was distant feeling of nausea but I think 5meo put me so much out of my body I hardly noticed it.. I knew I was quite far in dmt hyperspace but not as far as I wanted to go and decided it was soon time to smoke 5-meo-dmt. An hour had passed since I downed the mimosahuasca and I felt like the tryptamines were peaking, I was tripping rather hard with more 5-meo-dmt than dmt like headspace around me.. there were some cool but not too strong (like strong ayahuasca) visuals around me and I decided it was time to smoke 5-meo-dmt. I loaded myself a large hit on foil, maybe larger than i had ever smoked before: 20-25mg probably more towards the later.. I was in great mood and there had been no bad feelings nor nausea during my trip this far so I felt pretty comfortable with my decision of taking the hit even though I was bit worried where it might take me because I was already very deep in dmt space.. I proceeded

I smoked the 5-meo-dmt from foil with bottomless bottle (imo the best method), there was alot of smoke and just seeing the amount of it going into my lungs made me think something like 'daamnn.. here we go'.. It hit me faster & stronger than ever before, right after I put the bottle down and settled my back on the sofa I immediately knew I was further than ever before and this was before the 10 seconds mark! next 10-15 minutes were something that i have troubles explaining with words, time halted, I was everything and nothing, I could FEEL the universe flowing through my head and my consciousness, at the peak of it I remember thinking that this is it all ive ever dreamed off and 'cosmic orgasm' came closest to what could describe what i was experiencing.. i remember watching straight up and seeing mad visuals: whole new textures were opening up beyond the place that once was the ceiling above me.. 

this was WAY more than my any experience with pure smoked 5-meo-dmt.. usually when i smoke 5-meo-dmt i have these feelings of fear and nausea before breakthrough and often during it but this time I was SO out of it in seconds that I passed all these lower levels without even noticing it and during the peak I was so dissociated I didn´t have a clue of my body or my surroundings or my senses.. Its really hard to recall how long the highest peak lasted but after 15 minutes i was pretty fucking shocked and amazed from what just happened and went to bathroom and fell down on water on ground wetting my shirt, returning to my physical body felt weird and I thought i was gonna vomit but it never happened.. after 40 minutes from smoking the 5-meo-dmt i was still in condition where I usually would be after less than 10 minutes from smoking it sober.. most of that 40 minutes after the hit I just wandered around my place with stupid retard grin on my face saying stuff like 'oh fuck' or 'damn' over and over again.. I gradually came down from dmt space and in less than 2 hours from taking the hit i was pretty much back to baseline and was full of life and just felt real GOOD bout myself and everything. 

there was no bad feelings at all during the trip.. some mild nausea but it was almost nonexistent, after I returned to my body from the 5-meo-dmt hit i felt like i was gonna throw up and actually wanted to because i usually do it on ayahuasca but i couldn´t vomit even tho i tried. Still the trip was so strong that there's no way i could do it again in near future.

besides great experience, this trip had some good impact on my life, I had already cut down my weed smoking and after this I stopped it and have been smoking only once a week without any probs or withdrawal and stopped frequent use of 5-meo-dmt and other research chems, saving it now for special occasions like in couple of weeks when old friends coming for a visit :)
