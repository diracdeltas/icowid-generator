Last meal 5.5h (rice/meat) before intake @ 22.15

First effects (slightly dilated pupils and a little amphetamine-buzz) noted  at half an hour. Nothing to the 1.30 point, apart from some concentration problems and a bit `witty' feeling. Feels suprisingly normal. Unnoticeable mood-uplift. Sounds appear to be louder.

Going outside. Cars are more shiny, and appear to be all brand-new. Shiny things are *fun*.

Mistake: if you've taken a visual drug, things like finding your way on a dark forest-path can be a bit difficult. Part of the problem was that my vision wasn't extended downwards, into the less light-sensitive region, and that color-vision was already starting to generate small open-eye visuals which more or less prevented the `black & white' vision from kicking in.

Looking upwards, the sky seems closer.  Stars started wiggling, then connected to patterns which were moving.  A little bit later, single stars were forming lines. This expanded into geometric patterns which started in my peripheral vision, extending quickly inwards. In a second or two the sky was covered with rotating triangles and escher-like manifolds. Impressive. CEV's start rapidly, and persist a little while with eyes open. No cosmic feelings, however. But maybe that's a bit too much asked from this dose.

After half an hour, I like to have other visual stimuli than stars. Decide to ride home. Looking at a house at the end of the road is like looking at a tiroler waldstube halfway down a mountain. Depth perception is *definitely* increased. Estimating distances is also difficult. Roads appear to be very wide & vast, and enhanced in contrast. Beautiful. It appears that there is more fun to be had from looking at bright things, than sitting in the dark.

At the 3.5 hour point, I'm still a bit surprised with the absence of any hefty mood/mind-altering effects. Also no `insights' yet. Of course, I know that I've taken a psychedelic substance, but my mind still feels clear. Weird stuff. Decide to go to a club to let it wear off, and also to see if this is `party stuff'.

4.5h: I *could* go to sleep; after a few minutes of dancing I think that going to sleep would be a waste of the 2ct7. A nice thing of 2ct7 is that it keeps you `fast' at a constant level for a looong time, if you want to. Similar to 2cb in that respect. Visuals are only noticable with closed  yes. 

Minor grudge: I would like to `feel' the music. I think I wouldn't
decline 50mg mdma at this point.

6 hours: Feels like mdma, but is pleasantly distinct. Very socializing. Differs from mdma that it is more `witty'; instead of just walking around with a big grin on your face feeling good, you notice all kind of things which are funny, and then start to smile. It's also less `hippie-like': mdma knocks you out with empathy, to the point that you even feel sorry for brutal people harassing you (cokeheads..). 2ct7 has no tolerance for the intolerant. Good, IMO. CEV's still present. Notice that a ticking hi-hat can be transformed into a tunnel of small yellow/blue dots coming at me. Nice. If these are the first signs of synesthesia then I'd definitely like to try 20+ mg :-)

8 hours: crotch heating wakes up. Round things are fun too :-)

9 hours: No problems falling asleep.

Next day: nice afterglow; no physical problems. No hangover, still feeling
a bit giddy.
