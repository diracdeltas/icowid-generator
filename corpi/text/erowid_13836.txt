I want to share my experience with Adderall, the drug that made me have a deep connection with other people, and surroundings.

It started a monday morning, my friend is prescribed 30mg of Adderall, he gave me one pill, I noticed it was orange, and said AD/30 on it. I went home, in my room, chopped the pill up, snorted it, first thing I noticed, was a warm rush in my chest, 5 minutes later, I caught myself dozing off, kind of like pot, but alot hyper, I turned some music on, I noticed I was very calm sitting down, but if I got up, I was hyper, the music made me feel empathy for others, a true connection, I talked to my girlfriend, anything came to mind I said, I loved talking, I loved being with her, music sounded alot better, my appetite was down, I had no desire for good whatsoever, this feeling lasted 1 hour, after that I was just tired, with a little anxiety, truly a nice experience
