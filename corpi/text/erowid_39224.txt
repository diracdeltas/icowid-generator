Careful, this is not a controlled drug, but it should be.  It really works so well for pain (post operative surgery, I *refused* morphine in favour of some of these!!).  

It's as heavy duty for me as Diconal is for pain.  But reacreationally...100mg Buzzy, happy, sleepy, carefree.  A cooler buzz than DH-Codeine or like buzzy morphine - 4 to 6 hours.

Any more and it get's me agitated.  Keep on waking up at night thinking I can hear noises (burglars?!?) when really it's nothing but a windy night outside.  

Can get the pulse & blood pressure elevated.  Difficult to pee.

It can get addictive. I'm on a box of 50 at the moment and it's hard to say no (but that'll stop with this box - physician prescribed!)
