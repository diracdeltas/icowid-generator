Sure you have all heard of the warnings about crack cocaine. My story is probably not different from the rest.<!-- but needs to be told again and again to get through to even non drug users.--> I have snorted, shot and smoked coke many times each. Snorting it produces and steady high that last about 30-45 minutes and is fairly easy to come down off with a few beers or Tequila shots. Shooting is a powerful, almost to intense, rush that overtakes your entire body and lasts about 1-3 minutes and is the worst to come down from outta the three for sure not to mention the pin marks on your arm the next day. Smoking it is just plain evil. 

I went on a 4 day binge about three months ago and completely wiped out my credit card which had a $1200 limit in those 4 days. I was out of control and told myself that I would never do it again. Time went by then one day I found a good sized $5 rock hidden away in a shoe I hadn't worn since my last binge. I don't have alot of shoes it's just that I forgot where I put them during my last binge because I hid them so well while tripping out. So I thought what the heck one hit wouldn't hurt a bit. Took one friggin hit and that just wasn't enough. I then, over the course of the next 3 days, drained my credit card again that hadn't even been paid off completely yet, my bank account and another credit card. Whoever said crack is cheap should be shot. It's cheap until I start then it drains my wallet real quick. I thought I had control but this was the last straw. I should never say I'm just gonna do a little because it's a big fat lie and I will be broke before I want to quit.
