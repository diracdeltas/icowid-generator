It was night time and me and my friend decided to light up, I had a joint and so did he, we smoked and went back inside, I sat on a chiar feeling good, but ten minutes later I started to panic. The entire night I was screaming. I felt horrible. The next morning I woke up high and I had the shakes the next day

Why did this happen? Marijuana has been good to me in past times.
