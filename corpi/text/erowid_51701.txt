When I first heard of this drug, I discovered it in my grandmother's medicine cabinet. Didn't know what it was, didn't really care. One night on a Dextromethorphan  high I had that 'empty want-more' feeling psychedelics often bring. I grabbed three of these small white tablets with blue specks labeled as 37.5MG Phentermine HCI. 
   
Ever since I've grabbed a few Phentermine's here and there, usually for social circumstances. I've found the effects similar to other uppers, I'd compare the two I consumed earlier to a low-dose of Dexadrine(About 15-20MG approximately). Phentermine is cleaner in effects, however, as compared to amphetamines and stronger anorectics(such as Benzphetamine or Phendimetrazine). 
  
I think this drug is an excellent stimulant, compared to legal stimulants such as Caffeine or Ephedrine. Mental stimulation and unrelentless energy a possible side effect when exceeding recommended dosages.
