This proved to be a very pleasant mix.

1.5g of P Cayanescens Mushrooms
2 Yellow Jackets [each contains 25mg ephedra alkaloids and 200mg caffeine alkaloids]

T + 00:00  I eat 1.5 grams of the mushrooms, and swollow the two yellow jackets

T + 00:10  I feel very good, euphoria.

T + 00:30  Euphoria has grown quite a bit, beginning to get some visual distortions, with objects stretching and bending a bit.

T + 01:00  Experience peaks.  Good closed eye visuals, no nausea, feel very very good about myself, feel very energized and a very strong euphoria. 

Peak lasts for about 3 and a half hours.

Coming down - the effects simply trail off.  No negative after effects whatsoever.

Afterward, I get a good nights sleep and wake up the next morning feeling wonderful.

Provided for a very pleasant experience lasting about 4 to 5 hours with no negative side effects experienced.
