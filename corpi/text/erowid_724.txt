Sure, nitrous can be fun, but I really haven't used it in years. Why? Too many bad physical effects, including headaches, dizziness, slight nausea, etc. Not fun, and if I wanted to get sick I'd drink alcohol---and I don't want to do that, either. One friend who went even more overboard even claimed he got lasting tinnitus from nitrous use.
