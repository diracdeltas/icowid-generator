A few years ago, my dad was prescribed Vicoprofen (7.5/200) for his frozen shoulder, which was pretty much cured by physical therapy before his prescription ran out. I was hunting for ibuprofen one day when I found the unfinished bottle in the medicine cupboard, and there were 9 pills left that hadn't been touched since 2002. I saw this as a perfect opportunity to try a new drug, so I looked quickly online to see what was in it so I knew what I was taking. It was really my first experiment with any drug besides cannabis or alcohol. 

I skipped breakfast and popped three with my coffee one morning and went to school. On the bus, I started to feel light-headed and dreamy, but looking out the bus window made me feel a little carsick. Walking into school, I felt like I was floating but my stomach was aching and I was dizzy when I stood up. Every time I took a step my stomach would cringe, but as soon as I stopped it would be ok and I could concentrate on how different I felt.

Unfortunately, at the time I had several short classes so I had to walk around a lot during the day. After less than two hours of almost constant motion, I felt so sick I had to run to the bathroom because I was sure I would puke. I dry heaved in the bathroom stall for a few minutes, then decided it'd be better to lay down and wait for the nausea and dizziness to pass. The more I walked the dizzier I got and the more I felt like I needed to vomit, and my legs were screaming 'SIT THE FUCK DOWN! STOP FUCKING WALKING!!!' but I made my way down to the nurse's office anyway. She gave me some crackers and I took a nap for an hour or so. Afterwards my stomach had settled, and I wasn't dizzy but I still felt a little weird, like reality was a little fuzzy around the edges. I made it to the end of the school day and looked up more about vicoprofen when I got home. That crappy day wasn't going to discourage me, the bottle wasn't gone yet.

I found that taking Vicoprofen on an empty stomach can cause nausea, and the typical dizziness is made much worse by moving around a lot. That would have been nice to know beforehand. I knew I could avoid a bad experience like that by eating and just chilling all day, so I decided to try again when I didn't have school.

Well the weekend came and I still had six pills left. I took them to my boyfriend's house, and we each popped three. We both ate breakfast and laid on his bed to chill and wait for the pills to kick in. I think being with him helped make the trip what it was that day, I'm always happy spending time with him. I was scared my stomach would start to ache again, but a kind of fuzzy, drifting, floating feeling seeped into my body -- and my stomach was silent. I was reassured that I could relax and not worry about getting sick. I felt noticeably different. When I tried to stand up, I instantly got too dizzy and my legs buckled, so I got comfortable on the bed and stayed there. It felt like I was moving and spinning and floating verrrry slowly and dreamily when I laid still. When I closed my eyes, it felt like the world disappeared and I was floating through blackness.

Suddenly I realized I felt heavy, like gravity had gotten stronger. I tried to lift my arm, and it seemed like it took a monstrous effort to do it -- but when I had finally lifted it, it felt like I wasn't controlling it anymore, my hand was floating in the air and it was weightless. When I got used to the new reality I had found after ten minutes or so, my boyfriend and I just chilled in each other's arms and talked for hours about the meanings of life and love and existence. I've never had such deep, meaningful conversation in my life. Reality seemed like it had shifted - everything was different, but in a great way. The world was perfect and everything I saw and touched made me happy, especially my boyfriend. We were -- and still are -- so in love, that kind of love that makes you feel high when no drugs are involved. When this particular drug got involved, I felt love for him in a deeper, more meaningful way. When we hugged, it felt like our souls touched. 

After a few hours, the floating feeling started to fade but I still felt euphoric, everything was right with the world and suddenly I had all this pent-up energy. I had to move. We put on music we both loved, and danced and sang together around his bedroom for awhile, until all the extra energy was gone. Then we just held each other, suddenly deeply in love again as the last bits of the dreamy drug-induced state dissipated and my feet finally touched the ground a solid.

Quite an intense drug, in a strangely mellow way. It was an excellent experience I would love to repeat alone someday, so I could get lost in my mind and just think to myself. I can see how painkillers can be habit-forming. It was a profound experience for me. I would probably do it more, but I don't want to kill my liver with ibuprofen or acetaminophen.
