It has been quite a while since I first got blown away by xtc and I must say I have never looked back! I have come out of a black hole of depression, I quit 4 a while cause I didn't have my head on straight at the time and didn't quite realise that it is a social drug and is never 2 b confused as an addiction!

Now that I am clear that it is a tool used to enhance a night and one night only I have put alcohol aside and I have never felt better. I have more friends and a better attitude towards my health and life and most of all I am gauranteed to carve up the dance floor 4 hours on end!!!!!

The sixties had LSD and we've got XTC and I believe using XTC in moderation can allow us to achieve anything!<!--if we've learnt anything from history that is we can do anything as long as we do it in moderation and god knows our kids will be motivated by the next three letter trend its just up to us to enjoy and stamp our history on this one NOW!!!!--><!--Play it safe and tell your friends what you've had and how much, have a buddy system, and drink water like your a fish. As long as you remember that it can all go very wrong very quickly u should be okay.-->
