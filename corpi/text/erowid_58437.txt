[Erowid Note: 
Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe recreational use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]

I used to consume a lot of air duster. Probably about a can a day for 4 months or so. When I first started I just got a little buzzes. It makes me feel heavy and I hear something that sounds like a light saber pulsating past me. It also makes your voice extremely deep.

After a while I started taking more hits and holding them in longer. If I take enough hits and hold them I sort of go into a different world and I am completely detached from reality. I have seen my self be crucified and all my flesh come off my bones and fall to the ground. I have also seen poodles from outer space come and answer the questions of our species. It can be anything really. My brain is what comes up with this stuff.

Now all that sounds fun right? Well it is...at the beginning. After a while I got completely hooked on the stuff. On more than one occasion I almost got hit by cars. I just had friends looking out. Also I have countless cigarette burns from passing out with them. I finally stopped when I realized that I couldn't not only do complex math in my head anymore but not even simple math. I also for probably about two weeks after I quit had my whole body go numb and get a bit light headed about every thirty seconds for five to ten seconds each time. All the mental problems went away after about six months, but I think I am just very lucky.<!--I urge you not to try this. You are doing nothing but completely wasting your body away on this-->
