I had never really tried smoking crack until I was with my current boyfriend.  Yeah I had snorted a few lines here & there over the years & was happy with that.  But then one night after we had finished working , he came home with my powder & he sat down on the couch & pulled out a pipe, micro torch & a teener of crack.  

I did a few lines & started watching him hit the pipe.  After watching him do a few hits i told him that i wanted to try it.  Well thats all it took.

Over the next few months we started smoking on almost a daily basis.  I stopped caring about everyone & everything including myself.  I started to lose alot of weight & people noticed.  I was on a high that was losing its staying power ( not lasting as long) each time I smoked.  

Finally one night after being on a 2 day binge we ran out of crack & there was no money left to buy anymore.  I crashed bad & became suicidal.  I walked out into my garage & tied a clothes line around my neck.  The next thing I remember was coming too in the hospital.  I was told that my boyfriend had cut me down.  I was very lucky that he had been there, because if it wasn't for him I would have been dead. 

I spent 3 days in the hospital with a crush injury to my throat.  During those days I thought about everything I almost lost because of crack cocaine.  

It wasn't worth it.
