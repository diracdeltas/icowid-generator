Today I had the experience of my first promethazine trip. I had gotten promethazine syrup from a doctor a year ago and I just realized that the syrup has loads of codeine in it (thanks to Paul Wall's music).

Anyways I grabbed the syrup bottle and drank about 20ml. After about 10-15 minutes I began to feel warm and fuzzy, as well as a bit sleepy, however not so tired I had to sleep. The feeling was similiar to taking about 3 vicodin. By this I mean the warm euphoric but not overwhelming sensation. It was quite pleasent and I experienced no negative side affects other than slight sleepiness.

The next day I decided to have a ciggerete dipped in syrup. I dipped the ciggerete and let it dry for about 1 hour. The smoke was extremely harsh on the lungs but it was tolerable. I finished half the ciggerete before my balance was off and I needed to sit down. I felt very dizzy but in a very euphoric way which I laughed at due to the way I was stumbling about. About 1 minute later I went back outside, sat down, and finished the rest. I felt great, however the duration of the trip was only about 20 minutes but the effects were much stronger than the oral method. The oral method lasted about 2 hours.

I would enjoyed it due to it's state of well being but not overwhelming tendencies. All in all it was alot of fun but I don't think I will be using too much anymore at least in the smoking sense because I can see how I could easily get hooked on this delicious and soul-satisfying cough syrup.
