The Lortab experience has become an addiction for me, but one I don't mind as it does not affect my daily routine.  This routine consists of at least 10 10mg lortab per day as I have an unlimited supply.  My tolerence has gotten so high that this amount and a few beers make for one happy camper.  My liver enzymes are fine, checked every six months with a slightly higher than normal reading that is still within the norm.  You see, I am a psychologist and although I can't prescribe meds, I am surrounded by people who can.  When I am on these, I feel a total relaxation of mind, body, and spirit.  I am very easy to talk to, almost like a cannabis high without the paranoia and 'hallucinative' properties.
