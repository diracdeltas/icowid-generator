I was given this from a friend of mine who told me of its remarkable visuals I figured I'll take it home for a free day I've had few psychedelic experiences before nothing crazy

Later that same night however a good friend recomended I trip with him as my trip sitter I agreed knowing I had no plans the next day

We were in my basement at ten thirty PM I had dinner a few hours prior at this time I was feeling a little beat but generally in a good mood I swallowed a 30mg dose wrapped in a tissue

1 hour
I felt nothing me and my buddy got some mcdonalds and came back to the basement

2 hours
Feeling a bit weird but shrugged it off

3 hours
Maybe something but getting anxious and pissed off wondering if it was a waste

3 1/2 hours
Me and my friend were talking about a movie when I noticed noticable distortions of his voice I felt really earie

4 hours
I feel it the room appears to come to life it feels as through my basement is experiencing a slow motion earth quake body load is almost sickening wrapped myself in blankets while my whole life seemed to appear in rapid succession on to my walls

4 1/2
Same feelings but more intense wasn't nauseus but feeling real sick the visuals were good like but not sure if it were worth it due to sick feeling I figured I would feel better in the comfort of my room

5-9 hours
Felt better but still weird sweating like crazy odor smells like a chemical very weird laid on bed as my whole world came to life I had crazy revelations and thoughts on life a few times I got intense hallucinations causing my muscles and jaw to clench and tighten up but a snapped back and quickly relaxed myself my whole room was one big kaliedoscope all pictures and still life had a life of it's own posters on walls would talk to me my perception was totaly fucked

10-14
The intenseness soon gave away to a pleasent feeling yet I was still getting strong visuals I went outside on my patio to get some air watching a thunderstorm it appeared in slow motion beatiful colors ran over the ground the sky glistened like jewels it was a pleasent come down by 9 am I was feeling like it was the last of it I ate cereal and went to bed woke up 4 hours later and went to a friends felt good truely a remarkable psychedelic
