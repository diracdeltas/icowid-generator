Last night my 3 friends and I embarked and a wonderful mushroom journey that started terrible and ended rather pleasently. I hada stomache ache from coffe earlier, so to make the nausia subside, i smoked one bowl of marijuanna then began to prepare the mushroom tea. The tea consisted of with ginger, honey, and orange juice. I brought the tea to a boil, then let it simmer for 10 minutes and poured it into a french-press. This was done for each infusion. By the end of the second infusion, the visuals were allready beginning.

The fear began to set in when my stomache started spasming I began to think irrationally that I was poisened. I stared crying non-stop and fell into a hole in which I thought I was to die. Though constant reassurance from my other tripping buddies helped, I was not enough to fully make the bad trip subside. The fear grew and I remembered a lot of bad trips are caused by a growing anxiety. One of my buddies had a bottle of colonazepam for anxiety  and he gave me 2 mg (a daily dose). In about 45 minutes, I felt my heart stop racing and my body relax and I realized I was still tripping, but in a now pleasant fashion.

I wanted to share this so people would be aware of the safety and assurance that comes with combining the two drugs.
