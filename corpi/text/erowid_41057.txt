I am bipolar and on medication (Lithium and Geodon).  I tried a pill of ecstasy and waited for about 2 hours but nothing happened... the only thing I felt was a mild panic attack (which is strange because I rarely get them).  Thinking the pill was bunk I tried another that I knew was good about a month later.  The same thing happened although the panic attacks were more severe at the time.  

So I guess their is something with my body chemestry / medications that stop MDMA from working.
