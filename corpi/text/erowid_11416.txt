10:00pm

Took 8 Dramamine (50mg each, for a total of 400mg), reading that 8-12 tablets was a good dose to start with.  I have a very strong tolerance to most drugs, for some reason, and so I started low.  The pills were bitter, and I gagged a couple of times choking them down.  Nothing serious though (Of course, rancid dog shit covered in maggots would taste good after trying Nutmeg).  Sat down to watch some movies with my girlfriend, who opted to act as my 'frysitter'.

11:00pm

Feeling the slightest bit stoned, and quite relaxed, I decided to finish off my bottle of Dramamine, bringing my total mg up to 600.  12 tabs, for those not mathematically inclined.  I felt that if 400mg didn't kill me within an hour, I was not allergic, and wouldn't be in serious trouble by taking 200mg more.  Continued to watch movies, sitting on a couch with a blanket covering me the entire time.

12:00am

By this time, I had gone to the bathroom at least 6 times with a full bladder.  'Stumbled' to the bathroom might be a more accurate description.  I felt very heavy, but only on the right side of my body.  I braced myself for this, and only bumped lightly into two walls on the way to the bathroom.  Upon returning from the bathroom, I sat back down on the couch, feeling no effects, really.  My girlfriend asked me if I went to the bathroom, and I responded with a 'Yeah' that probably didn't come out too well.  Realizing I hadn't been talking at all during this entire time, I found it fascinating that I couldn't really speak the way I wanted to.  Upon hearing my 'yeah' my girlfriend turned to look at me with a puzzled face and asked 'what?'  Apparently, she hadn't said a word to me at all, though I could have SWORN that she had indeed asked me if I went to the bathroom.  We had a good laugh about that one, and I thought 'cool.. I can handle that'.

12:15am

Now somewhat oblivious to the movie, I stared at my white wall for a while, almost searching for the hallucinations I had read about.  No good.  Saw a mild green color out of the corner of my eye, but it looked exactly the same as if I had stared at a light for a few seconds, then looked away.  Sighing, I went back to watching the movie.

12:25am

Unable to concentrate on the movie whatsoever, I let my eyes wander again.  This time they settled on the Christmas lights I could see through our sliding glass door.  There was a bit of condensation on the glass, so it looked like each light had a glowing ball surrounding it.  Realizing this was what it was, I still had an impulse every few seconds to go pick up that ball and hold it, but kept myself from doing so (what was I, crazy?)

Time Unknown

Each of the twelve million times I got up to urinate, I felt heavier and heavier.  It was not a pleasant thing for me.  It felt like I had just downed a few cases of beers, the dizziness and lack of coordination included.  I even remember being disappointed that I wasn't 'feeling it'.  I sort of remember watching another movie, but still cannot remember what it was or what it was about.

Bedtime

Feeling extremely tired, my girlfriend and I decided to go to bed.  I pulled my blanket over my shoulders, then crawled into bed.  My girlfriend put on another movie in the bedroom, and I curled up and tried to sleep.  I sleep on my side, normally, but every time I tried to do this, the leg that was 'on top' started hurting and my toes would twitch.  I flipped back and forth, trying to alleviate this, but to no avail.  Thinking the movie was why I was not sleeping, my girlfriend turned off the TV, and went to sleep.

One of the many times I turned over, two red lights on the VCR caught my attention, and I looked directly at them.  The first thing that ran through my mind was that it was a demon watching me (NO JOKE!).  I guess I didn't realize how afraid of demons I was, because I nearly wet myself right then and there.  I had to look at the VCR and tell myself what it REALLY was a few times, before calming down and trying to sleep again.

I remember sleep being EXTREMELY difficult, and surfing the net for a while between attempts to sleep (impossible for me to remember the details of that)

Personal Advice:

It was a cheap drunk feeling, costing me about 4 bucks.  I feel like the latter part of the day was non-existant for the most part.  I will probably not do this again anytime soon unless I REALLY want to forget a day and pass out.  I would NEVER go above the 600mg dose, either.  The effects were so strong and not terribly pleasant, so I can only imagine what a higher dose would be like.  If I do try this again, I will try it with caffeine pills as well, to try to balance out that exhausted feeling I got.

Things remembered later:

Whilst laying in bed trying to sleep, I had my blanket obscuring half of my vision.  I opened my eyes once, and had the feeling like I was being pulled under my blanket.  It only startled me for a bit, but it was unsettling.

I remember having little internal conversations with myself.  Sort of a 'free-association' if you would.  I remember the word 'pony' coming up a couple times, then my mind would ramble off into something else, and I would think of new interesting words and just smile.  I believe I had my eyes open at the time, but I don't remember seeing anything, if that makes any sense.
