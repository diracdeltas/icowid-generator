We smoked in my room with strange music for the trip. We smoked bowls and all of a sudden my arms felt light then boom I was in this state where I did not know where I was but my reality was a 'dancing world', where everyone had to dance and it was just the norm. 

A 'dancing god' came to me and asked me to dance and come with him but I said no I was with my friend (I spoke with him in my head so my friend did not know what I was thinking). So I began spinning without control as if the dancing god was making me dance. But what weirds me out is what if I said fuck it lets go and I followed this spirit? Would I have walked in to the wall and realized I was tripping or would I of actually been sumwhere? Thats all shook it off after.
