Well lets start from the begining, i was sitting in my dorm room boared as hell and decided i would try this Dramamine Trip i have read so much about.  Well i went up the sstreet to the Pharmacy boght 1 pack and ate 18 pills.  Didnt notice much except a high/drunk feeling... Then it happened i ventured outside and smoked some chronic.  Then on my way home the visuals started.. Lots of fucked up shit.. Made it to my dorm safe and tripping hard.  Then the bad part started.  A constant itching everywhere over my entire body.  Nothing would stop this either.  I itched and itched for hours untill i finally fell asleep.  It was the MOST uncomfortable experience EVER!!!!! I would NOT recommend this to ANYONE, nor would I ever do it again.
