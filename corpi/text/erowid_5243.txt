Ecstasy has changed my life in many ways.  I used to be the kind of girl who was uncomfortable at parties and not happy in group situations.  I 've been in college for the last four years and have always looked for a way to enjoy my time off from school. 
 
Alcohol although fun and inhibition freeing left me feeling nauseus and spent in the morning, not to mention, I hated the way I acted (and other drunk people too) it also oversexualizes you and that is a potentially dangerous situation nowadays.  Anyway, I tried ecstasy the first time in June.  Like most people I was astounded by the openness I felt and the relaxation that came from feeling 'accepted' from the people around me.  But more than that, I had always loved music, on E music sounds angelic, it literally took my breath away.  The reason I kept doing E, about three times a month was because of its self-discovering properties, I learned more about myself in those beginning experiences than I had in my whole twenty two years!

As the months wore on, and I used it regularly, I began to notice, memory loss and an inability to fully concentrate on school, I became depressed frequently and I felt emotionally detached from the people closest to me.
My use of E is seasonal now, (every three months) I will do one. I found that this brings the intensity of the first experience back, without draining you. 

Ecstasy is a miracle drug, it has done so much for me. It taught me how to be happy and because I am not 'on' the drug, I do not get depression spells anymore, rather I can recall the feeling of being deliriously happy at seeing a sunset or talking to good friend while I was on ecstasy and bring the glow into my normal life.

They had a saying in the eighties when MDMA first came out ,that the experience was like a phone, 'once you get the message you should hang up' I guess I've finally got the message.
