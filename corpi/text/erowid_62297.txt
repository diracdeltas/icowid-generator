Took LSD on a weekend, Friday night Spring of 1995. Was sixteen years old. By Saturday night was an inpatient at a psychiatric unit. 

Twelve years later still has no insight of life, has difficulty communicating, has a diagnosis of schizophrenia/bipolar disorder. His whole life is ruined and the LSD which was suppose to give him a psychedelic trip took his life, his memory and his family. He exists but does not live.

I am his mother and this is our nightmare for life.
