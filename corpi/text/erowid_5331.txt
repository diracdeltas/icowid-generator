I never used to have dreams until I started using LSD.  It's been about a month since I first tripped and have done it a few more time since.  EVERY single night when I go to bed, I've had a very memorable, vivid dream.  I  love it.  I even look forward to going to bed because I know I'll visit some entirely new world when I'm sleeping.  None of the dreams are nightmares either.
