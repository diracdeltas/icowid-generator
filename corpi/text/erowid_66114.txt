The first time I tried methadone, I had gotten it from a friend of my brother's who had back problems but never used them.  I started out with 10mg and enjoyed it a little bit.  I threw up and could not  do anything with my girlfriend the next two days (sexual problems), so I told myself I wouldn't do it again.  However, I had the opportunity a few months later. By this time, I had checked out experience vaults online, and decided to give it another go. This time, I ate a meal before taking 20mg and this time enjoyed myself much more.  I remember the desire to be friendly and caring to others.  And I liked the feeling much more than the alcohol I had previously chosen as my main drug.  I've since stopped drinking.  Methadone offers the good feeling and comradery, but without the sickness or stupidity.  I had complete control of myself on methadone.  Flash back to today, and I am still taking the pills on a semi regular basis.  I now use it whenever I have severe anxiety and have to do a speech or presentation at school. I now use it whenever I have severe anxiety and have to do a speech or presentation at school.  And the only problems I have with this drug involve the sexual side effects and the visible drugged out look that takes experience to hide.  <!--Overall, make sure you have a full stomach and take a small to medium dose.-->  It does wonders when I have anxiety and want some help to loosen up without really changing the way I act.  It is better than alcohol and one of my favorite drugs.  And the absolute BEST thing about this drug is how long it lasts. I can take a 30mg dose and be relaxed for 2 days and have a relaxed afterglow.<!--I recommend it to anyone who doesn't get addicted easily.-->
