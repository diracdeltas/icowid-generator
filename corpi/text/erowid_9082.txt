This experience is about taking 2x Morphine tablets (30mg each)  The onset for me took about 15-30 minutes and lasted about 4-5 hours with some lingering after effects.  Before I took it was feeling pretty happy already and I continued to feel happy and blissful throughout the duration of the experience.  The feeling was not unlike that of being on heroin which produces a nice warm body feeling and a feeling of being somewhat disconnected from life around you.  I just wanted to sink into my bed when I was on it.

Driving is a little difficult on this drug, it's almost like driving on pot because I tended to make big movements rather than being able to have total exact control.  A couple days after taking it I was slightly constipated which is a common effect of opiates.  If you take it, take a little at first if you can to get an idea of your tolerance and then build up to a larger dose.  Be careful not to take too much or your breathing can stop and you can die.
