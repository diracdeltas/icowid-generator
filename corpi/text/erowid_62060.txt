All I know is when I used to hit the clubs in Orlando every weekend back in 1999 and 2000 when I used to take ex it was way better and now ive tried it maybe like 20 times over the past 7 years because everytime I get it its garbage. I honestly dont think its as potent or the people manufacturing it dont know what they are doing. When I used to take them at the dawn of the millenium they never made me feel crappy afterwords. But over the last 6,7 years when I take them I feel like I almost roll but I whind up dissappointed and dehydrated and tired,depressed and mad I wasted my money. If only I could find some good ones again.....
