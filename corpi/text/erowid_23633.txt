Something strange happened, after taking 5 mg liquid deprenyl 2 hours after ingesting the GHB I noticed that the GHB effect was not going away at all.  In fact it got stronger and stronger as the day wore on with me going 'down the hole' 3 times.  The third time was 7 hours after taking the GHB and it was a messy experience to say the least.  If it weren't for the fact that everyone I know is experienced in all manners of strangeness in guinea pigging I'd have ended up in the hospital.  

It wasn't until a full 12 hours later that the effects of the mix wore off and it was followed by a very tryptamine-inspired lucid daydream type of half sleep.  I awoke, if I even slept, and felt fully amazing the next day except for the twisted ankle I received as my comrades led me to a bed as I nodded out (in an instant, unlike GHB 'holes' normally) and I collapsed on my leg funny.

I have contacted the source of the deprenyl and alerted them to what occured and they are looking into it.  My friends enjoyed their GHB experiences and had no anomolous effects what so ever.
