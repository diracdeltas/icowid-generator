Gbl Experience

I have my first time gbl use I would like to share. The withdrawls are no joke, and I only used for a week. At first, for sleep. When I woke though, I was always still tired. Like it was more of just passing out, instead of seeping. I would wake to re dose at like 12am and then again at 4 am. This stuff sucks.

I ended up tossing 200mls down the sink.  The insomnia is crazy. I have been up for almost 2 days now. All I want to do is rest and get some sleep.<!--I dont recomend this stuff at all.-->
