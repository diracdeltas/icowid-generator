I quickly made myself some Earl Grey tea. It was decaffeinated, which means that it had caffeine, but very little.

I began drinking it down, and I took in a deep pleasure from the sweet taste. I became more calm from the hot water and cream, and became a bit sleepy as well. I had drank a cup of raspberry tea (caffeinated) an hour earlier, and the waking effects of it hit me along with this new tea, creating a strange combination of being both tired and awake at the same time.

All in all, it was quite enjoyable...
