I smoked DMT crystals on one occasion at a friends ranch in NM. Carambolas! I wouldn't recommend that stuff to my worst enemy.

As I exhaled the second hit, I awoke in a parallel universe where the plants and animals were naked expressions of solid spirit. A multicolored beam of energy curved toward me in a flowing colorful mass. I was approached by strange spirit people who motioned me to come with them. I had a moment of extreme confusion and an insanely strong burst of anxiety caused by a complete loss of control of my visual perception of the everyday world which I could hear in the distance and the vivid spirit world that I had entered. I felt lost and frightened. It was a huge blast of emotional anxiety. I almost felt as if I had died.

For me it was too much, too fast, like an acid peak that comes on in a flash and only lasts ten minutes. My experience might have mirrored my own inner turmoil at the time and I may try it again now that my situation is more stable.
