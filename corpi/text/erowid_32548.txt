It's puzzling how an intelligent, well educated, conscientious woman can play russian roulette with her own mortality.  I have experimented with countless drugs, not as a young, inexperienced adolescent, but as an adult.  I have researched my drugs and drug interactions, which has led to a lot of flushing drugs down the toilet for fear of my life and mental well being. Cocaine, however, somehow defies my reasoning and rationale, and at times I have felt death creep up on me, but I can't stop.  

Tonight I consumed cocaine and alcohol.  I did this alone, everyone else is asleep.  I have no one to converse with, no loud music to dance to, there is no party here other than the one I have created in my isolation.  I began to research my drug interaction on the internet and discovered countless articles (not propaganda) on the dangers of mixing cocaine, alcohol, and loads of cigarettes, yet I find myself continuing.

My mind is numb, my body tense.  The initial feeling of clear mindedness, alertness and productivity is gone.  My heart is pounding, self pulse ranges between 110 and 135, productivity tomorrow is completely lost. I won't stop until it's gone.  

I don't go out of my way to get it, but it seems to be everywhere these days.  Out of sight, out of mind, but when in sight compulsive behavior sets in.

Somewhere inside is the real me, but that person is silenced and distant.  Hopefully I'll get through, find some strength to resist temptation...until then, it's just another roll of the dice.
