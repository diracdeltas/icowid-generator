I found out shortly after returning from the doctor's office that the pile of freebies he'd given me to 'calm me down' were very potent depressants.  I had just began my 6-month abstinence from the ghanj, and at the same time began taking Ritalin for my newfound ADHD; this combination proved to make me Mr. Irritable.

The first night I popped one of those quick-dissolve tabs onto my tongue was amidst my dinner.  During that meal, I had ONE beer, then shortly afterwards, passed out for 14 hours.

Other times were less extreme, but I'd recommend keeping away from even seemingly harmless amounts of alcohol while taking this medicine (and even shortly after its cessation -- what a long half-life it's got!).

Also, I keep some tissues nearby -- the liquids like to run out of my face when I eat this stuff.
