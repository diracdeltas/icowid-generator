At around 5:00 that afternoon myself and two friends smoked some 5-MEo-DiPT on a small bowl of marijuana. After feeling some light threshold effects we decided that this was a substance we wanted to experiment with more fully. Around 9:00 that night we all dropped a tablet of Ecstasy and we were fully rolling by around midnight. Around 1:00 we measured out capsules of the 5-MEO-DiPT and prepared to take them. As far as we can discern now there would have been about 50 mg in each capsule. Coming up was hard and fast, and we all began to see shifting patterns and colors. A strong tryptamine buzz developed and I began to question whether I liked this feeling or not. I began to get more and more confused, and eventually I found myself running around outside my friend's apartment screaming and babbling uncontrollably. 

The following is pieced together from my friends reports, as I don't remember anything further.

Apparently I had gotten very violent and had to be physically restrained by my friends. Attempting to knock me out they hit me over the head and succceeded in cutting my scalp quite badly. The ambulance was called and I apparently fought 4 paramedics and sustained cuts and bruises to most of my body. Of this I have no memory. I woke up in the hospital and had undergone a CT scan, EKG, and various other tests. I had no memory of the night before other than right after taking the 5-MEO-DiPT. This experience was not pleasant and culminated in a huge hospital bill, 20 staples in my head, and cuts all over my body. I do not suggest this drug recreationally at such a high dose - no fun at all!
