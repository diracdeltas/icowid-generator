I am prescribed Effexor XR 150 mg to be taken as 75 mg in the AM and the PM. Recently I railed a hit of X and took another (different appearance and dealer) orally and nothing happened on either case. I know that X is anything but a pure or standardized drug but I find it rather hard to fathom that both pills were complete duds since I felt nothing. 

It is my conclusion that antidepressants strongly interfere with the ability of MDMA to do its job. Both are linked to Serotonin in the brain and I would imagine that Effexor somehow prevents the MDMA from doing its job.
