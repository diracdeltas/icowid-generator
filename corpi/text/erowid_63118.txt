Before two nights ago, I had never heard of any flower that made someone trip.  Two of my friends came to my apartment with six trumpet shaped flowers. I was skeptical that they would do anything. The two friends, my roommate and I, boiled all six flowers in about three cups of water and strained it. We divided it evenly into four glasses and mixed with juice. 

We sat in the living room and finished our cocktails in under ten minutes. It was about 8:00 pm. After only five minutes, my roommate was the first to mention feeling something. He had also been drinking beer. Then I began to feel strange. I felt a shortness of breath and was unable to focus my eyes on anything. When I would move them, the motion seemed delayed. I noticed that everyone's skin tone seemed much redder than usual. From this point on, I could only remember bits and pieces, and the order in which they happened was unclear. The four of us have since been able to recount each of our experiences to piece the evening together into a somewhat coherent timeline of events. But I will have to recount my experience of the night as it seemed to be. 

I remember looking at the faces of my friends and having little to zero recognition of who they were.  They were bright red with sunken black eye sockets. I tried to speak but was unable, as though I was attempting to speak after exhaling all of the air from my lungs.  At one point, I brought my fingers to my mouth to take what should have been the final drag of my cigarette, which I felt in my fingers and understood I had been smoking, only to realize there was nothing there. In its place, I felt a powdery residue, which I believed was all that remained after it had disappeared. I genuinely believed that I had discovered how to make cigarettes disappear and this made perfect sense to me.  I attempted to explain what had happened to my friends but was unable to get the point across. I also remember a hallucination of a nickel-sized spikey bug that appeared to be a combination caterpillar and sea urchin. It had hundreds of legs and moved as if walking in fluid. I also saw hundreds of ants devouring a cigarette butt on the kitchen floor. 

Early in the evening, my roommate, who was not feeling well, went to lie down in his room. He came out in what appeared to be a drunken stupor, crashed into several walls, and finally a table and then the floor next to me. This awoke me from the half-sleep I was in. I noticed his head was bleeding and he appeared to be out of his mind. His behavior resembled that of someone who was sleepwalking.  The more I looked at him, the redder he became. Then I started hallucinating that there were bright white growths on his eyelids. I was concerned for his safety but felt unable to do anything about it. I drifted back to sleep. I was awoken again by loud noises. My roommate was travelling strangely around the apartment touching things and staring at them in confusion. He tripped on a fan and appeared to wrestle it while trying to gain physical control of it.  

One of my friends got it out of his way but he was still on a path of destruction. He reached out to touch my turntables and fell into the table they were on, scattering the records propped up against it. Concerned for his safety and, admittedly the safety of my belongings, I asked him to sit down and directed him to the couch. He sat for a moment and got right back up. I found him standing in the closet facing inward. He told me the next day that he remembered that he was in the closet trying to find the room behind the bathroom mirror, which he did not recognize as a mirror, and in which he saw his own reflection which he perceived as me, playing a joke on him. 

Of the four of us, my roommate seemed to be affected the most. Of my other two friends, one of them (we'll call him J) remembers very little. The other (V) claims to have been thinking relatively clearly the entire night, aside from not recognizing me. V related a large amount of occurrences that no one else could remember. He claims that at one point, J grabbed a stack of wooden skewers and put them in a pot saying that he was making pasta. Then I told him that he had to break them up. I broke them in half and dropped them on the floor. Then we both made bowls of cereal and ate them. My roommate and I apparently tried to put up a shelf that we had taken down days earlier.  We supposedly put it up by resting it on open cabinets. It soon came crashing back down on our heads and we struggled with it for a couple minutes before putting it aside. J was apparently putting his socks on and off repeatedly and pressing his toes into a puddle of juice on the floor. 

By about 1 am, we were all able to communicate with each other although I cannot remember it very well. J and V left and my roommate and I tried to discuss what had happened. We found that we repeatedly forgot what we were talking about and decided it was best to go to sleep and hope that our eyesight and brain function would be back to normal in the morning. The next morning, we found many things out of place which none of us could explain. My toothbrush was in my camera bag. The toilet paper dispenser core was in the kitchen sink. There was juice and cereal spilled on the kitchen floor, the living room carpet, and a table. Surprisingly, there was little evidence of my roommate the bulldozer, besides the gash in his forehead, and blood on the walls. The experience was incredibly interesting, but overall very unpleasant. I will never touch the stuff again.
