To begin, a bit of drug history. Salvia has been my drug of choice for about a year now. My first experience was wonderful...very beneficial, a few gentle, long-lasting effects that, to this day, I still enjoy. Several subsequent experiences were with a 20x extraction and some marijuana, and those did not go as well as hoped. I was so thoroughly detached from the world that I thought I had truly been ripped from reality. 'Comfortably numb' this was not. The feeling in my limbs left me for days. My sleep was erratic and of very poor quality. True, it opened my eyes up to just how 'real' reality is, but the after effects lasted too long, and were too extreme. So, suffice it to say, I had had some bad experiences with salvia as I went into this night. Overcoming these was one of the most brilliant parts of my trip that night. 

A and I had lit some incense in his room, and we were lounging around, relaxing. A played a game, and I lay on his bed and listened to some Pink Floyd. As he played, I packed a bowl of passion flower in my homemade water bong. A had never smoked out of a water bong before, and so was very excited to try it. Now, I should say that this was not passion FLOWER, per say, but it was the rest of the plant...the stems and whatnot. However, it still made a delicious tea, burned very well, and put me in a good mood whenever I consumed it, so I still consider it a worthy addition to my herbal collection. In any case, I filled the chamber with smoke, taking my first hit as I did. I handed A the bong and he took it all in one quick hit. We stood by the window, smiling in anticipation, and blew the smoke out. Already I could feel a lightening of spirits. 

We cashed the bowl on the first hit, so I filled another. A took the green hit this time, took a trip to the window, and then sat back down at his computer desk. I took my hit, and when I turned around I saw A drinking out of a water bottle with a wild smile on his face. I was overcome with a wave of laughter, and knelt down, burying my face in a blanket that was on the ground, and A and I laughed for a minute or two. 

About 10 minutes after our first passion flower hit I loaded a bowl of little fuzzy dagga flowers. They were not in full bloom by any respect...in fact, the ounce I bought was about 3/4 empty 'flower pods.' I had to pick out all the bizarre looking flowers by hand to get any sort of good hit off of them. I threw a leaf or two in the bowl for good measure, packed it down on top of the unburnt passion flower, and lit it up.

The dagga was more powerful than the passion flower, by a long shot. No hallucinations, no mind-blowing, but our spirits shot to the stars. After just one bowl (on top of the passion) all cares in the world were obliterated. We laughed for what seemed like 5 minutes, purely because we felt so good. Then I packed half a bowl of dagga (to give the smoke some substance) and a pinch of 10x salvia. I let A take the first hit, since the salvia was his. Salvia will always be the main event when I smoke. Always. So it is a big deal to use it well. I have stretched a gram out for several months. At this point, I realized that hitting the salvia was going to top this trip off. After the salvia, everything else would be nothing. With this in mind, I finished the hit A started.

Nothing! Normally a hit of salvia, even a 5x extract, sends my head reeling. I normally get dizzy and stony, have some mild visual hallucinations, and get otherwise 'messed up.' But this hit just amplified the emotional high I was getting. I thought perhaps the water cooled the smoke down too much, but then remembered that not only did A torch the salvia the whole time he filled the chamber, but that I smoked out of a water bong the first time I tried salvia, and the effects were much more intense.

I filled another bowl, and took the green hit. Again, a heightening of emotions, overall bliss...but no visuals, no body high...nothing! I sat, dumbstruck. It wasn't a waste at all, but at the same time it did not live up to potential. I decided to try whatever I could to make these feelings last. 

I lay on the ground, hands on my chest, head on a lump of blanket, and closed my eyes. No CEVs. The darkness was a bit more active, but nothing like the way I knew it could be. Suddenly, my thoughts started racing. Gradually, a wave of emotions swept over me. I realized that I could control these emotions. A very important thought entered my head...'You can choose how you feel!' After thinking that, I developed this whole concept in my head.

'People feel the way they feel for a huge number of reasons, and not ONE of those reasons is 'I want to feel this way.'' I told myself. 'People feel the way they feel because society tells them they should feel that way. Because they have felt that way before in similar circumstances. Because they interpret that their personality ought to affect them in such a way that they should feel this emotion.' These reasons kept flowing through my head. 

Finally, I arrived again at the point I needed to arrive at. 'You can feel good! Just because you feel you ought to be worried, because salvia has done bad things to you, because you need to be 'serious', because you need to feel 'in control'...It is up to you! It is YOUR CONSCIOUS DECISION!' A smile spread across my face. I started laughing. I laughed for at least 15 minutes. Every once in a while I would open my eyes to see my friend doing something absolutely crazy, and that would get me laughing all the more. Occasionally this ultimate bliss would pulse harder than it had been, and I would be moments away from sobbing with joy. I could hear my laughter take on a sobbing bent for a second or two at a time. And it felt good.

Finally, I stood up, smiling, and sat at the computer. I saw that A's away message said 'Playing Doom 3.' I thought that this was not entirely appropriate, and so I decided to reference Pink Floyd a bit. I typed 'Staying home to watch the rain' and immediately a runaway train of thought started. I typed and typed and typed, and didn't stop until a page and a half later. As I stared blankly as the computer screen, my field of vision jiggled left and right in its traditional salvia-influenced way. As I concentrated on this I realized I was concentrating much less on my typing. Finally, for about a paragraph, I was able to type without any influence of the conscious mind. I typed some incredibly bizarre sentence, and this snapped me back into the real world.

The glow wore off over the next hour or so, and I slept soundly that night. The next morning I woke up refreshed and genuinely happy. The actual 'trip' lasted for no more than about an hour and 15 minutes. I was hovering just above baseline for about an hour, at which point I bedded down.

This trip was much different from any of my other salvia trips for several reasons. The first is that it came on with much less intensity. Normally, after even one hit of salvia, I get dizzy and have to lean against something sturdy. Normally after my second hit I have little ability (and even less desire) to stand, and lay down to take my trip. The passion and dagga flower removed this normally unwelcome body high, replacing it with a gentle tingling that was went almost unnoticed. The second great benefit of pre-empting the salvia was that it helped my high to be much more emotional. It also allowed me the clarity of mind to concentrate on just what needed to be thought about. It made things more spread-out...normally, my salvia highs will put a lot of raw energy into one or two aspects of my altered consciousness, and it causes it to become nearly overwhelming, which brings up the occasional 'bad trip blip.' The flowers helped to spread this raw energy over a larger area of my psyche, allowing me to enjoy many more parts of myself than normal.

I found the dagga and passion really do bring on a marijuana-like buzz, without the physical numbness that tends to accompany it (at least in my experience.) The salvia adds a whole new dimension, one that I feel more people ought to explore.
