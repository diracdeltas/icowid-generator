First Time with Ambien

This whole thing happened by accident, but proved to be interesting and fun.

I recently came home from college, and did not have a job yet.  So, I would stay up till four to five in the morning and wake up around one in the afternoon.  I decided that I needed to get my sleeping schedule back to more decent times if I was going to get a job anytime soon.  I tried everything from not going to bed at all so that I would be so tired I would have to go to bed earlier to lifting weights and running during the day to wear me out - but nothing worked.  As my last resort, I grabbed some of my mothers Ambien.  The bottle said to take one before bed, and for some reason I felt I needed three, and swallowed them about ten at night.

I had eaten dinner like two hours before taking them, and so they kicked in about thirty minutes or so.  I slowly felt more and more intoxicated.  I went online to talk to some friends about that time, and it felt like I could not type a thing.  My sight was not blurred or anything; I just felt very drunk and could not concentrate on getting the words out.  So, I gave up and got offline.  By now, it has been about forty-five minutes since I took the pills.  I sat in my computer chair feeling very euphoric for about ten or so more minutes just listening to soft music, and then I got so tired that I literally rolled off my chair and onto my bed.  I woke up thirteen hours later felt very refreshed.

I think that I will try it again at some point in time, but that I might try and get some caffeine or other stimulant in my body before hand so that I can stay awake to enjoy the high longer.
