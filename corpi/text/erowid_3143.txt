I just read a report posted by 'M. Nemovanta' recently and came across a connection that brought back fond memories of a journey I took about 8 months ago.

Myself and a very good friend of mine, J., who has been my companion on various psychonautic adventures of mine since I started about 10 years ago, decided to get some cubensis.  Being semi-veteran cosmic explorers ourselves, we decided to do more than we ever have before at any one time, to see how far out we could go.  My mother was a hippy back in the '60s, and when I communicated my intentions to her and her friend, her friend suggested that we fast for 24 hours prior.

And that we did.  Ingested 1/8 shrooms at 4:30 in the afternoon.  Without going into details, which would be much too time consuming and severely lacking anyway, what the other report reminded me of was that we in fact lost all contact with reality.  We totally forgot that we had taken anything and were unaware that we were altered in any way....

We've tripped a lot in our years, but I have never been so thoroughly dissociated from any hallucinogen (LSD or shrooms- we haven't done K or anything like that).  I don't know if it was the fasting, or the fresh shrooms, the volume of what was consumed...although I'd imagine it was a combination of these.  In one particular instance I remember, we were at the beach, waiting to get our things together when reality started to return enough for us to figure out where we were and who we were.   I kept asking J. what time it was, because he had a watch, and he would tell me 'it's 6:45,' 'it's 7:15'...but neither one of us could grasp exactly what that meant.   We decided to walk back to my house at about 7:45.  As we were walking back, these realizations came a few minutes apart:
1. We were tripping.
2. We had taken something to cause us to trip.
3. It was Saturday night.
