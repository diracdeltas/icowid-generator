I just read the report re: the person who extracted with ethanol, 80 proof vodka heated and plan to try that this weekend. I tried the tea and did get a pleasant  feeling but not a real euphoria..energized and took to tasks with enthusiasm..   I had hoped that by adding an additional 2 grams a little later in a tea preperation that the experience would be augmented or conitinued but did not really get any additional 'high' or energy. 

I had been busy and gone to a meeting that evening so this was stretching my day.   Drove home and simply chalked up the 
poor solubility as a problem.. there was a resin around the cup and I really didn't do a lot of boiling. 

I am satisfied however with the energy boost that was not the caffeinated wired feeling.
