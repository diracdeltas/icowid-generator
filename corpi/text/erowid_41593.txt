This was my first and only use of 2C-I.  I enjoyed the experience of 2C-I quite a bit, but thats not what I'm  writing to report.

Three days after taking the drug I lost some function in the right side of my face. By the next day I couldnt move it at all.  I went to a doctor who told me it was a condition named Bell's Palsy that can arise out of either a viral infection of the facial nerve or pressure on the nerve.  At the hospital they assured me that this is never a lasting problem and will go away on its own in 3-6 weeks.  

I dont know that the 2C-I was the cause of the Bell's Palsy however.  It only happened 3 days after taking the drug.  I also found when i told my father that both my grandfather and my uncle had had the same condition at some point, although both of them were much older when it happened.  I have found no evidence on the internet of Bell's Palsy being hereditary, but it is certainly reassuring to me that my relatives got through it fine.

As of writing this it has only been 6 days since my experience and my face still doesn't work.  My friends have taken to calling me 'Two-Face'... and I'm sticking to weed for a while.  If anything else goes wrong and points in the direction of 2C-I I'll write agian.  Otherwise, use the drug at your own risk, but I'm sure you all know that already. 

Sincerely
   -Two-Face
