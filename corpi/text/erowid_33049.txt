The night started with my friend telling me that he had aquired mushrooms.  I do not eat mushrooms any more, I have had my fill of that drug, but I had a strong lust to trip.  I arrived at my friends place where he had taken a gram out of his bag, he then informed me that we were going to smoke the mushrooms not eat them.  I am willing to do anything once so I took a bunch of bong rips of it, we also smoked about 3 grams.  Right after my last hit of the mushrooms I felt alot more intoxicated than I did before I smoked it.  The feeling was that of when you start to come up after taking acid, the point before the trip starts.  This was what I call a trip tease, I felt this feeling so strong that I was sure that I was going to trip, but I did not.  The feeling is very good but leads you to believe that more is on the way, but there is nothing more.  The effects wore  off after about 1 hour, it was good but I would not do it again.  The taste is very unpleasing and leaves a nasty taste in what every you smoke it in.
