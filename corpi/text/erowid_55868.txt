Ibogain is one of the most incredible hallucinogens I have ever known.  It so full of self exploration, and that only gets more and more complex until it reaches a very serious form of ego loss, and then back again. I actually cant compare it to any other psychedelic. The peak of a smoked salvia trip comes close though (experientially).  Its just so very unique in that way.   

I have used mescaline, lsd, lsa, dxm, smoked dmt, ayahuasca, mushrooms, 2c-i, ketamine, amanitas, and the only thing that comes close to iboga is smoked dmt, smoked salvia extract and ayahuasca.   Nothing will ever be more intense for me than ayahuasca, but iboga was right up there with the most mind blowing experiences. I actually would say that iboga reminds me of any salvia experience but it and its peak lasts for hours and hours.

Ibogain lasted a VERY long time and I ate parts of the plant gradually.  This was not some sophisticated extract or something.  I never became sick to the point of it interfering with my trip.

It can heal, I do believe, but thats another long story.

This substance cant really be compared to any other.  If I had to make a comparison, honestly I would compare it to Salvia D. 

Its message is not so clear but if you can grab hold, you are good as gold.
