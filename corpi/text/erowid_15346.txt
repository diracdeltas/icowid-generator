[Erowid Note: 
Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe recreational use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]

Well I was in this drug program cause the court sent me to it, I was doing pretty good so I decided to get a little fucked up. It was about 12:00 I had duster in my bag so I took 3-4 huge hits in a matter of 10 seconds, I blacked out and when I woke up I was sitting down with blood all over my face and a teacher helping me patch my shit up, they called an ambulance, apparantly a kid went inside and got a teacher when I hit my head and passed out. So the ambulance came put me on a strecher and such, we arrived at the hopsital my teacer 'Mr.R' was with me, helping me. I have to wear a neck brace for about a week then goto some doctors and shit, also I got 40 stiches across my face. I just plopped to the ground everyone told me, I look like I was in a car accident. Eventaully 6-7 hours later I was out driving home, my dad was a jerk so I spit on him, I told him I was car sick so I opened the door and puked, went home and went to sleep.

P.S. I won't be trying this shit for awhile, everyone told me when I was on the ground I was laughing and shit, boy was I fucked up, not like this again maybe sitting down with padding around. This was not worth it now I have to rest and set things straight with everyone, but hopefully I think most likely things will be okay.
