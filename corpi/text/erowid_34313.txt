I have been using AMT as an antidepressant and anti-addictive (Methadone Cannabis Heroin; 35 mg, 1-2 g and 0-200 mg daily, respectively) for one week now. I started out insufflating 5 mg each morning, and now smoke 5-20 mg each morning. The mood elevation effect is quite strong, with a mild amphetamine-like stimulation and very noticeable sociabilizing effect. This compound greatly increases my strength and endurance at work (I'm a tree trimmer) without any loss of appetite or distracting psychedelic effects. I have not suffered any amphetamine mouth chewing or jaw clenching either.
 
As an anti-addictive, this compound slightly decreases withdrawal symptoms and cravings, especially the fatigue, which is the most debilitating symptom of Methadone withdrawal. I would be very interested in comparing AMT to AET, which is mentioned in TIHKAL as an effective treatment for opiate addiction. Unfortunately AET has been schedule I for about a decade and now AMT has followed.
