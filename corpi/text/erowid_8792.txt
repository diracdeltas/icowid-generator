Dried mushies, I believe, make a fine smoke. After a couple of pulls, the tingling feeling you get just before acid kicks in starts to grow, giving a very pleasant, bright sensation with the occasional 'judder'. 3 of us partook, and all agreed it was a nice buzz. The 'shrooms were 3 week old, dried, hand picked in Wales. Give it a go. It's worth if it it works!
