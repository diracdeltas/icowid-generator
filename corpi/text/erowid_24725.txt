I just wanted to post this for all of you who think that meth is a harmless drug. I have read so much of the same statement on this site that I feel it is necessary to tell you about my experience. Perhaps it is just my brain's chemistry, or maybe some underlying mental disorder, or maybe it was just some weird ass shit that I took?

I don't know but I took some speed before work today around 5:30 am, right after a light breakfast of 1 hard boiled egg and 1 piece of ham. I ingested the dope in my coffee, and planned on cleaning for a couple of hours before I had to be at work at 9:00 am.  When it first hit I felt great! I couldn't wait to get to work and get going!!! I felt like I was floating, and cleaned while listening to music that never sounded that good!! I walked to work, which is about a half an hour walk (2.5 miles), and still felt good, but definitely fucked up.

I changed clothes and then realised that I was sweating uncontrollably. This shit was potent - maybe I took too much! Anyway, I changed clothes and fixed my hair and suddenly I was retardo! I felt incredibly self conscious and 'fake'. The interesting thing is that I have done this drug MANY times before...I used to have somewhat of a habit, and now I remember why I gave it up!

Anyway, I started to feel like this and tried to talk myself down many times but it wasn't working. I decided that a cigarette may help me calm down a little and went and smoked one and also drank a glass of milk...but to no avail. I decided to go home and rest; this stuff is really extremely potent compared to some that I have had before and I had taken way too much - I am 100% sure of that now. I have by now taken one trazadone and one percocet and drank a bottle of wine so am starting to feel some better, but mark my words: NEVER AGAIN!!!
