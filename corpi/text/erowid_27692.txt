First Real Nitrous Experience
I had done nitrous once before with not much effect, just much confusion.  So I went to my friend's house, knowing he had some whipped cream.  I arrived at his house and immediately asked for the cream, as I wanted a real experience that night.  After some delay, the can was handed to me.  I inhaled for what seemed like an eternity, and waited several seconds before exhaling.  From what my friends had done, I thought I would be laughing like hell by this time, but I wasn't.  I shrugged and went to sit down; I thought I hadn't had enough, so I was going to sit quietly and watch my compadres.  

Then it hit me.  I looked at my friend and burst out laughing.  I tried to sit down, but the weight of my body was too much and I slipped out of the chair in hysterics.  I started squirming around the floor, laughing quietly.  My friend at the computer had pulled up a Where's Waldo picture, so I moved to it (I could move really fast, and when I did I would see the beauty of everything.  Everything radiated with love).  I started laughing, then a face replaced the scene (not a hallucination) and I cracked up.  The primary effects had worn off by then, but it was an amazing experience for me.<!--I definitely reccomend Nitrous as it is very easy to acquire, and it only lasts a short while.-->
