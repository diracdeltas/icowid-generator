I occasionally trip on LSD when it becomes available to me (not often). On the trip in question, I ingested 1.5 blotter hits of some supposed very good LSD. The trip was much more clean and intense then I expected from 1.5 hits which leads me to believe there was either a larger dose on each hit then I'm used and/or the LSD was properly synthesized when I had received improperly synthesized LSD in the past.

I had mild HPPD mainly from an unknown MDMA-like substance I did ~25 times approximately 2.5 years ago, along with various experiences with other psychedelics(LSD, cannabis, and psilocybin, among many others). The night after the trip when I turned off the light to go to bed, I noticed that my HPPD was completely gone. It was never really a problem as it was composed of tracers and other mild visual distortions. I thought I would mention this as LSD could possibly be used to help someone with much more severe HPPD (though it would seemingly have a reverse effect).
