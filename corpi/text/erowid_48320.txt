I had bought 2 points of PCP from a random guy walking down the street for $20. The guy said that it was really good and all of my problems would disappear when I'm high on PCP. So I glanced at my friend, he smiled, so I quickly agreed.

It was the first time I had ever done PCP. I'm used to drugs like extacy and shrooms which I do on a regular basis. I didn't know what to expect because my friend who was with me had never done it before either. We were both a little anxious.

We went to a quite place and we railed 1 point each because the guy said that would screw us up. After I railed it, I felt a very strong burning sensation in the back of my nose (I have railed E before and it wasn't this bad). 

My freind was already fealing the stuff after about 5 minutes. It took about 15 minutes before I felt anything. After about 25 minutes I felt like I was  really drunk. The feeling intensified after about 40 minutes. By then I was seeing streams of light passing as I walked down the street. My friend looked really dazed as we walked. We stopped at the mall and sat in the food court. I, literally, could not think of anything. Everything was jumbled inside my head. By now my entire body felt like jello. I remember trying to read signs but I couldn't. The letters would scramble up and kept changing. This went on for about two hours. About three hours after railing the PCP, I felt very disoriented and paranoid. This continued on for about an hour. After that I felt very calm and tired.

It was a really weird trip, but I'll probably do it again.
