I was scared as hell at first. I didn't know what to expect, I guess. I never felt this hesitation in all my psychonaut experiences until the day my friend Brad showed up at my doorstep at three in the afternoon with a gram of uncut meth. A day before I had mentioned wanting to try some, but just a little, because I loved the hyped-up feeling of Acid but had had bad experiences with ephedrine and ephedra in the past. Now, here, in my apartment sat Brad, some other friends, myself and a gram of pure crystal.

He gave me a pretty big bump, I thought. Well, it looked big, at least. I snorted it after about three minutes of talking myself into it. I had heard a lot of bad stuff about meth, but I just had to try it for myself.

Time passed and everyone left my house about twenty minutes after I had snorted the line. It didn't burn my sinuses like I thought it would, but it didn't numb everything like coke does either. The drainage down the back of my throat was kind of pleasant, but it didn't have that 'coke' taste to it.

When it began to kick in, I realized why they call it 'speed' real damn quick. I was a little impressed, however I was getting bored. The drainage down my throat was making me nauseated so I decided to smoke some weed. Problem solved. The one thing that caught my attention is that I'd lose the buzz if I didn't stay busy. I had to keep moving.

Well.... My apartment was messy (but not too messy, mind you), and so I decided to clean it. Funny thing is, I have a small studio apartment, and I probably spent 4 hours cleaning it just because it was too damn hot to go outside and do anything. There is only one word to describe my place after I came down: Spotless. 

I'd do it again, I think. It's at least one hell of a way to have fun while cleaning and doing other dirty work.
