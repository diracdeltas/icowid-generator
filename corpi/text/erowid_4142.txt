I had the flu for about 2 days, pretty much bed ridden.  Early in the morning , around 4:00 A.M. I could not sleep, so I ingested the GHB.  After about 15 to 20 minutes I became very sexually aroused, my wife did not want to do anything so I tried to sleep.  Eventually I wasn't responding to my wife trying to talk to me.  I could hear her, but I didn't feel like replying.  My wife then called the paramedics.  

One thing I need to tell you is, at this same time I had been doing a cycle of steroids.  The paramedics came and my blood pressure was 270/120.  This was stroke level.  They took me to the hospital, at that time I was dehydrated,they put two Iv's to increase my fluid level.  I felt like trowing up ,but I did not.  About two hours later I felt better and I went home.  I have done GHB many times since, but that time was the worst.  If you are going to take GHB, don't take too much at one time.
