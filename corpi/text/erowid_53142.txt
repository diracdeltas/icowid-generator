          My daughter was adamant. She didn't come home to die.
Maya* was admitted to hospice care in my home in May, 2005.
She had just turned 33. Her diagnosis was stage IV colon cancer.
She was in severe pain. She had undergone major surgery, and
endured three debilitating chemotherapy protocols. Physically
weakened, she was not a candidate for clinical trials.
          Hospice offered daily monitoring of
complex pain medication. For that reason
and no other, Maya consented to ‘end-oflife'
care. She said that living with me was
temporary, until she was well enough to
return to her home and her work as a
teacher on the west coast.
          While Maya's pain medication dosage
            increased during her first month of
            hospice care, her hope remained strong.
            She asked and indeed insisted that those
          around her support her will to live.
          I spent my days carrying out Maya's
            wishes. I prepared organic food using
            strict guidelines; I ground herbs from a
            Tibetan doctor and poured the mixture
            into gel caps three times a day; herbs from
            a Brazilian healer accompanied each meal;
            an acupuncturist, a massage therapist, a
            chiropractor, and a Feldenkrais practitioner
            visited Maya regularly; guided visualizations
            focused on shrinking tumors and
          renewing health.
          All these actions gave my daughter a
            degree of control over her life. At the same
            time, the practices sustained my flickering
          faith in her recovery.
          In June 2005, a friend sent me an
            email about the proposed MAPS-sponsored
            MDMA-assisted psychotherapy
            research with advanced stage cancer
            patients. Anecdotal reports suggested that
  "people with terminal illnesses who have
            taken the drug found it easier to talk to
            friends and families about death and other
            uncomfortable subjects." A quote from
            Rick Doblin stated that benefits might
            include "facing directly life's great challenge,
          to die gracefully and in peace."
          With trepidation I mentioned the
            study to Maya. She was not interested in
            discussing end-of-life issues. In her eyes,
            talking about dying was like giving in to
            death, and giving up her will to live.
            During a hospitalization, she told two
            palliative care specialists to "please leave"
            because she couldn't bear to see their
            expressions "that look like I'm going to
          die."
          Nevertheless, Maya was interested in
            MDMA. She didn't view it as a drug to
            help her die peacefully. To the contrary,
            she saw it as an opportunity to trigger a
            transcendent source of healing, and begin
          her recovery.
          The proposed MDMA study wasn't
            ready to enroll patients, so I began to
            search elsewhere for a psychedelic therapist.
            Fueled by the urgency of Maya's
            expressed intention to heal, and my
            unexpressed wish for her to have a good
            death if she had to die, I found help for my
          daughter.
          The psychedelic "therapist," Theo,
            approached Maya as a partner and a
            companion - not a guide - on her journey.
            The separation between teacher and
            student, and all perceptions of hierarchy
          fell away.
          Theo was a learner, an explorer, a
            collaborator, and a co-creator of experience.
            He told stories about his own life and invited Maya to talk about hers. We
discovered many connections, such as our
common love of children, animals, science,
and social justice.
          We wove humor into every session. In
            this way death was included and detoxified
            as part of the entire flow of human
            experience.
          Theo told a story about two lifelong
            friends, older men who affectionately
            called each other "Shithead." When one
            friend was on his deathbed, the other came
            to visit. As he entered the room he said,
  "Hi Shithead." The dying man acknowledged
            his loyal friend with a smile and
            said, "No, you're the Shithead." He
            promptly died, thus getting in the last tag
            and winning their lifelong game.
          Before her first session, Maya could
            only get out of bed a few minutes at a time.
            Sitting or standing caused her pain to
            spike to unbearable levels. She longed for
            simple pleasures like going for a walk.
            During the first session with MDMA,
            Maya's pain receded, her spirits soared,
            and she was able to walk to a park near my
            house and hang out with a friend.
          She was hospitalized soon afterward
            with heart arrhythmia, a jugular vein
            blood clot, and an intestinal blockage, all
            likely caused by her pain medications. The
            benefits of the MDMA session appeared to
            be lost. Ten days in the hospital without
            food left Maya much weaker, more
            anxious, and in need of more pain medication.
          Over the next two months, Maya
            chose to have three more psychedelic
            sessions: one with MDMA, one with
            mushrooms, and one with LSD, MDMA
            and marijuana. She was taking as many as
            twelve different prescription drugs
            (including ketamine**), for pain, for
            anxiety, for depression, for preventing
            blood clots, and for countering the side
            effects of all of the other medications. It
            was impossible to predict optimal psychedelic
            drugs and dosages. The progression
            of disease was another ‘unknown'. Only
            experience could tell us what would work.
          Although there were poignant
            moments with each psychedelic session,
            the results were not as dramatic as in the
            initial session. On one occasion Theo
            asked Maya how she felt about her pain.
            She said that it was like an unruly child in
            need of attention. She would send it love.
            On another occasion Theo asked Maya
            how she felt about her cancer. She answered,
  "There's a snake in my house."
            Maya was able to talk about her fears
            metaphorically during sessions.
          During the fourth session, Maya
            experienced strong waves of energy and
            shaking through her entire body. She said
            the trance-like state helped her shift focus
            away from cancer and her pain, to remember
            how good the rest of her body felt.            
          After her fourth session using a
            combination of psychedelics, Maya wanted
            to go back to MDMA, taking a higher dose
            to overcome the sedating effects of the
            other prescription medications.
          Theo was away on business for nearly
            three weeks while Maya's condition
            deteriorated rapidly. She was taking
            maximum doses of prescription medications
            with little relief; she was too weak to
            sit up or even to cross her legs; she lost half
            of her body weight; and she became
            incontinent.
          Faced with these changes, at first
            Maya told me that she was afraid her will to live was slipping away, but she didn't
want me to give up on her. Within a few
days, however, she began to say, "I can't do
this any more," "I want to go fast" and
"I'm ready for terminal sedation." She held
on because she hoped to have another
session with Theo.
          Theo returned from his trip, got my
            message with Maya's request, and came to
            our home for a high dose MDMA session
            the following day. For the first time, Maya
            asked her father to join us. She said, "I
            know I'm going to die soon."
          As the MDMA took effect, Maya's tics
            and spasms subsided, her labored breathing
            became easy and regular, and her pain
            vanished. We told stories, we laughed, we
            sang, we danced. Maya directed us to pick
            up her limbs and move them to the
            rhythm of the music. We were in love
            with her and she with us. We celebrated
            life. For approximately eight hours, there
            was only love.
          As the MDMA wore off, Maya's
            symptoms began to reappear. We discussed
            with Theo what to do next. We
            could keep Maya on low doses of MDMA
            and hope to control her pain, or we could
            alternate sedation days with MDMA days
            to maintain the optimum physical,
            emotional and spiritual benefits of the
            drug. We decided on the latter.
          Theo gave me enough MDMA for
            another session and offered to provide
            whatever was needed for the rest of
            Maya's life. The next day Maya slept
            fitfully. She awakened only briefly and no
            longer ate or drank. I looked forward to
            the following day when I hoped Maya
          would have another ecstatic experience.
          When morning came, Maya could
            barely be awakened. She took the MDMA
            sublingually, and promptly went back to
            sleep. Her sleep became peaceful, without
          tics, spasms, moans or gasping for breath.
          Maya's dad joined us when I told him
            I believed Maya would not wake up again.
            For the next eight hours while Maya slept
            peacefully, we told stories, played games
          and caressed Maya with love.
          At 10 p.m., Maya awoke. Her dad was
            stroking her and I was reading aloud from
            Laura Huxley, about the importance of
            loving touch and the nobility of death. She
            opened her eyes with an expression of
            absolute wonder, reached out to touch her
          dad, and died.
          We are grateful beyond measure to
            Theo, and to those working to make
            psychedelic therapy legally available. We
            are honored to have witnessed and shared
            a holy experience, my daughter's good
            death. •
