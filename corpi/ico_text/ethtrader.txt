The worrying possibility for Bitcoin's next leg down, Ethereum's bullish consolidation, a bit of Wyckoff theory for Bitcoin Cash and another brief look at NEO.

https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@matthew-analysis/daily-crypto-analysis-26th-jan-technical-analysisPlease take this with a grain of salt, there are no facts on anything that I'll be presenting, and this post is full of speculation and assumption.

By now you may have heard that Vince McMahon is planning on bringing back the XFL following the 2019-2020 NFL regular season, and you're probably thinking, "Why in the world would he do that?"  The former Xtreme Football League only lasted one season and was a horrible attempt at competing against the NFL, however, I think a new league can hold merit.

Several FAQs from the current XFL.com website:
*An opportunity exists to reimagine Americas favorite sport by putting fans at the center while leveraging a changing media landscape and evolving consumer viewing behavior.
*The new XFL is a single entity structure with plans for eight teams at launch, all of which will be owned by the league.
*The players' salary structure is still in development, but players will be paid to play and paid more to win.

Additionally, Vince McMahon aims to "re-imagine" football, and despite the former failed XFL venture, he is a proven businessman with a strong ability to make money.

Still, it sounds crazy and many are assuming it will fail again.  I like to try to see both sides, and Vince McMahon is a person who likes to be on the forefront new and radical ideas.  He took the Olympic sport of wrestling and transformed it into an entertaining global spectacle, and managed to raise his net worth to an excess of $1 Billion.  I'm not going to be so quick to dismiss his ideas and track record.

Now, why I think he can pull this off:
'Fans' are not going to exist early on, because there is no history or fandom to be had, thus we'll need to add incentive.  As a potential consumer, what would generate my interest?  Incentive and a lot of it.
*Give spectators the opportunity to control the game, so they have built in stake, similar to this idea (https://fcfl.io/thank-you.php?__s=uq1p6p2xkhgsthtbhpwp).  By tuning into the game, I can vote on which plays I want to be called, but let's take it even a step further.  
*Discounts - in stadium discounts for attending, correctly choosing plays, etc.
*Player endorsement incentives - We remember Rod "He Hate Me" Smart, but what if we had Tom "Amazon" Brady.  Give players the right to sell the name on their back to highest bid
*Fractional Team Ownership - The XFL can sell off fractions of each team and you can become the GM.  Fandom and viewership doesn't have to stop on Sundays.  You can now help negotiate the day-to-days through consensus ownership
*True fan loyalty - We all know someone that flip flops their fandom, but what if you were rewarded for staking your fandom based on length of time?
*Other things to be voted on: rules/regulations, team names and future locations, jersey colors and logos, etc.

Just a few small ideas, but the more I think about it, the more I think it can make sense.  Would love to hear everyone's thoughts
Seems like Joseph Lubin lied on national TV about incoming Ethereum futures. He said any day now and it's been months. Why do I have a feeling Mike Novogratz bamboozled him ?If I use MEW via primablock, when it comes time for token distribution from the ICO, do I need to do anything special to add that token, or will MEW automatically support thetoken? projects like this:

EDIT: this is just one of many listings.  They are hiring a ton of people to build this thing.  It's all centered on Ethereum.Hey Chaps, I wanted to invest in Symmetry ICO but found this nice summary of red flags so I thought it might help some of you. IMHO they are scam... 

-----------------------

[Source: Wolf Crypto News Telegram]

**Symmetry Fund - ICO Redflags**

If you are thinking about investing in Symmetry Fund ICO I would advise increased caution. Website and Whitepaper look very professional but digging deeper into the project, a number of red flags appear:


**1.** All LinkedIn team member profiles seem to be rather new, no recommendations present
  -&gt; they also seem not to exist outside LinkedIn / Symmetry fund website

**2:** There is no direct link between the Symmetry fund website and a real person:
-&gt; someone contacted the consulting lawyer who advised them, but he claims to never meet at any of the individuals behind the fund or saw any papers
-&gt; website of symmetry itself is registered through a hosting/DNS lookup protecting   
   construction (Domains by proxy), so is fully anonymous
https://www.whois.com/whois/symmetry.fund

**3:** all their advisors have been changed (previously members of the COSS team were mentioned, but they deny any link to it)
https://medium.com/@irfanmuhammadsyamsularief/investment-with-the-symmetry-fund-f5abafde425

**4.** Their advisor Mike Henkel also does not seem to exist, he also does not work for POLARIS Investment as claimed on the Symmetry Fund website

**5:** The advisor named Leah Kronshage was removed from the English site. When asked about it on Telegram, the admin Andrew stated: "he is an impersonator". Weird though, if you switch the language of their site to Korean, Leah is still there...

**6:** They promised to meet interested investors at the Dubai International Blockchain Summit, except no one showed up

There are better and safer investment opportunities out there. Always do your own research before investing in an ICO.

Recently i sold some of my stack in order to be able to buy the dip. I stored the FIAT on my GDAX account. Now i just check my account and see all the FIAT is gone and i suddenly have a large amount of LTC (i never bought LTC before).  I immediately sold all the LTC and transferred the money to my bankaccount. Now i see all this weird orders in my account for small amounts of LTC. I never received a message or email that someone logged in. (I use  2FA for both login and sending of funds). Please help.Blocktix has released their web app and is scheduled to release their mobile applications this week. This will be the leading complete blockchain (smart contract) based ticketing system. From their affiliations with big players in the industry, I can see Blocktix as one of the first mainstream uses of Blockchain technology that will be huge publicity for the benefits of blockchain and Ethereum. Hey guys, I already have a diversified portfolio and I reserved 1 last ETH to invest in some shill coin from Reddit. I was thinking going HAT Hawala, but they are promising fiat-crypto and I'm not sure they can delivery. So, I have 1 ETH waiting to go to some small cap coin or token but I'm out of leads.

Would you mind shilling me a coin? Low cap please, I want moon.

BTW, market will keep droping, HODL and believe, 500 billion market cap is nothing, we are just getting started.As you know Russia plan to ccept the law and legalize crypto, exchanges and exchangers. My friend has 3 domains: 1. ethereumstore.ru 2. etherstore.ru 3. ethstore.ru. How do you think an he get some money for sell them now? or maybe wait few years?I'm planning to send some ETH to get into an ICO. I expect it'll be over within minutes and I plan to complete ETH tx within a minute or two maximum. Say I wanna send 0.2 ETH via MEW - how much would you recommend for gas limit. It is automatically set at 21000. This seems a bit too high. What is the price of 1 gas? Interesting development...

https://www.rgj.com/story/money/business/2018/01/23/industrial-park-houses-tesla-gigafactory-nearly-sold-out-after-blockchains-deal/1059002001/

" Blockchains LLC, is purchasing 64,000 acres at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, with the deal expected to fully close by the first week of February, said Lance Gilman, principal and director of the industrial park.

The industrial park that plays host to Tesla, Google and Switch in the Reno area is almost sold out as a blockchain software company is finalizing plans to buy more than half of its land.

The company specializes in financial services, security, software and apps using blockchain technology  a secure digital ledger or record that is typically associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Blockchains LLC specifically deals with the Ethereum blockchain, which anchors the second-biggest cryptocurrency in the world. The Ethereum cryptocurrency is only trumped by Bitcoin in terms of market cap." 

" Blockchains will use 150 of the acres it purchased at the industrial center to build a campus park that will house the companys headquarters, Gilman said. What the company will do with the rest of the land remains to be seen.

I believe theyre going to showcase to the world everything that the blockchain technology is capable of, Gilman said. Now will they do all the work themselves or work with other developers to house other users? Only time will tell.

This might not necessarily warrant its own thread but I just wanted everyone to be aware that Coinbase (or possibly the card company) changed their merchant category code so that all credit card purchases are now treated as a cash advance. I have not confirmed this myself (only used a CC my first couple of purchases), but the reports are widespread. The change happened within the last 48 hours.

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: Thanks to /u/TrickyxWolfx for this response he received when inquiring with Chase to have the cash advance fee refunded:

&amp;nbsp;


"Hello XXX XXXX,

I am happy to assist you with the cash advance fee wavier request.

XXXX, the transaction to Coinbase dated January 20, 2018 is listed as a quasi cash transaction. It is categorized as "POI Funding Transactions(Excluding MoneySend)".

Let me share that Visa and MasterCard systems assign a category code to each merchant, based on the kinds of products and services they sell. Sometimes the system places merchants in a generalized category, like "superstores" instead of "grocery stores" or "gas stations."

I refunded your account for the two ash advance fees of $10.00 each. You'll see this adjustment on your February 9, 2018 statement.

A quasi cash transaction is one that is similar to a cash advance. Money transfers, money order purchases, gambling transactions, and other transactions where cash is accessed will be classified as quasi cash transactions. Quasi cash transactions are subject to a 5% transaction fee with a $10.00 minimum and no maximum. Also, they earn interest on a daily basis and accrue interest from the date they post to your account until paid in full.

The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for cash on your account is a variable rate of 26.24%, which is the minimum rate for cash.

We appreciate your business and thank you for being a Chase customer.

Thank you, xxxx xxxxxx"I'm creating a spreadsheet so I can keep track of everything and try to be as safe as I can be. But say you got audited even though you were being honest with your taxes, what are some things to prove to them? What are some things I should put on my spreadsheet besides my buy/sell order history? On Coinbase and GDAX when I download my CSV sometimes I see Transfer ID, Coinbase ID, Trade ID, etc, which ones am I suppose to look for and keep a record of?

According to EOS wiki [1]: 
"We expect that C++ will be the best language for developing high-performance and secure smart contracts."

Developing smart contracts has some pitfalls and can lead to vulnerabilities; we have observed them also in Ethereum's world when using solidity. However, from a technological point of view C++ is much much more difficult and therefore worse.  

As an investor you should really think about if EOS is a big deal in the long term (in case you believe in technology fundamentals)... 

[1] https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/wiki/Smart-ContractEarly bird tickets are nearly gone. Save $100 while supplies last! 

Attendees will learn everything they need to know to get started in the world of cryptocurrency as we highlight the tools and resources available to you.

All-star keynote speaker lineup to be announced soon. After party included with ticket (limited spacing).

Get your tickets: https://events.bizzabo.com/dayforcryptoit's not a huge amount but still : i've bought around 150euros worth of Eth on coinbase, and it went just a lil up from what i've bought despite the crashes. I won't bore you with the cents etc, but my account dropped from about 150 to 130euros and i have more ETH than when i've started to "invest"... Anybody has an explanation/same problem? (and i've thought about the variation of the euro itself, still doesn't make sense, it's like 20euros have gone poof)Rookie to crypto here, have some portfolio tools but all seem to present portfolio in FIAT instead of ether/btc primarily. I.e. Delta says my portfolio is x, up y while actually my portfolio in ether is down with z. So, not helpful if you're looking to grow in ether.

Any tools, tips or pointers to a portfolio site, app or something that I can use?This downed on me while reading a whitepaper *(apologies if it has been pointed out before)*:  

**Traditional enterprise**:  good ideas are locked in enterprise 'secret-sauce' vaults - the inner workings, business model of an enterprise was highly guarded (still is, and for good reason in some cases).  

**Blockchain/crypto business models**: it is all out there in whitepapers and github.  

You gotta love that!Everyone says that "if only i had spent more on X coin when it was X price!" but they forget that a lot of them would have sold early. 

so those of you who have held Eth from last January or before, how did you resist selling when it went to 20 dollars but crashed back down to 10? or how did you resist selling at 300 dollars? I'm interested in the resolve it took to hold.

What was the process? I'm in a similar position right now with another coin which i think is going to have an ETH kind of run, but you never really can tell for sure. 
zrx is the tokenI sold mine for more NEBL like 2 days ago. Fuck meI always hear these two recommended. WhyWell that's just great. I had a sell order at 0.0018.  As soon as I sell it's mooning. Just fucking great. Hallelujah!What?ZRX- Da sleeper.  Hide yo kids, hide yo wifeeeeSources?More cryptocurreny was lost during the Mt Gox hack. You lucked out with Coinbase.  They're probably the fastest, but not usually that fast. Kraken isn't known for their speed, but they're better than polo.  I had tickets open with them for over 50 days not once but twice.I don't have enough experience in C++ to comment, but I will anyway. High level languages are not necessarily safer just because they are (seemingly) easier. It might be easier to get started, but it's also easy to make a mess. I'm not saying C++ is devoid of pitfalls, but perhaps things like type checking would be advantageous.I'm sitting in a cubicle trying to get work done. It's Friday bruh I'm not staying one sec over.Well Ill be damned... 0x gdax... Tesla... This is definitely the best daily thread for crypto Hi, what is your ticket number? I can assure you there is a reason for the delay.The cryptocurrency is that you don't need trust. Did he miss the memo?This is my favorite timeline. Hope this happens in the next 3 months.Actually can't cause some weird shit with the space

Big Partnerships already in place. depends on how detailed and accurate the specs are. Development is actually really fast when you know exactly what you have to do. Compare the looks of both charts and tell me
We only benefit when BTC goes side ways Well, I guess we're going in either of two directions once this channel closes in:

Hopefully we blow through 1106 with some volume.It's been a good two weeks and none of us have seen any of our money. Kraken has been emailing us telling us to keep waiting and that they are working on it but no action has been taken and it's starting to hurt my bottom line. I rely on trading for a living and taking my trading capital is essentially taking away my income. 

Worse yet I got a newsletter email last night that they re-enabled margin trading on their platform and have yet to clean up their mess. Seems unprofessional and risky at best.

Please take care of your clients in a timely manner.

pinging /u/dont_forget_canada /u/Kraken-Tyler /u/kraken-jpjHave any of the recent bull runs been the direct result of positive news? The EEA certainly drove the March-June run. But since then I am not sure that's been the case. It may be a fools errand to try and time these movements with expectations about DAPPs going live, ETH futures announcements, protocol upgrades, etc. CONGRATS YOU DONT BELIEVE IN GOD.  YOU DONT NEED TO BE A VEGAN ABOUT IT.  I can't say for certain but I've been seeing ZRX a lot more in the news, and the biggest dollar value (at the time) crypto hack ever wouldn't surprise me as a key catalyst. Damn, rip to whoever fat-fingeredOmg, my eyes Blockfolio.  Some dodgy ED trade.I don't believe it does confirm it. bitcoin's mempool is full, so there was a hard limit to the number of transactions, that chart only really demonstrates that more people want to use bitcoin than can fit on the chain, and that Ethereum isn't yet being held back by that to the same extent. The scaling is very important, and I prefer ETH, but I don't think the 10X increase follows as a correlation with scaling. As Bitcoin's graph shows (so far) it is possible for price to not be correlated with T#.Throwaway was a shill,but go ZRX!30th January 2018, Coinbase, Nasdaq, Dubai, Google, Tesla, ZRX ETH RLC OMG, JesusChrist, he is a sheits finally deserving recognition it deservesIn other words, Eth is still tied at the hip with BTC fluctuations?its a great holdZRX finally seeing its day! strong hold! ThrowAWAY was right!Could be. Hope it's not a targeted p&amp;d.It was on cnbc as the next big coin I just got a notice on my Toshi app (developed by Coinbase) that they are making a dex that is utilizing 0x.

Smells like Moon Spirit.25%This is definitely one of the most undervalued projects in the space. Once they get the fiat gateway live it will be a great way to get passive investors in the space and bring tons of fiat into the space.Following, because almost FOMOing on TRAC new ezpz account ?you can reddit but can't look up news at work? if we reach 0.5 with BTC then BTC would simply die, our marketcap would be triple that of BTC, and our Technology is already 100 times better, media will only focus on the winner and discuss how outdated BTC isguys what's happening with 0x? wooI'm hoping that the early adopters/big holders who care about crypto have cashed out enough to leave lots of USD/USDT with limit buys across the big exchanges to support any significant dips, more than anyone trying to cause a panic. But who knows.

The crazy thing about so many believing that there will be a selloff whenever someone says contracts close is it's a self fulfilling prophecy... dump and pump.Lol where??I still think you're attributing this based on the wrong chart, it's BTC that's falling and bots are just making sure we don't take over. A bot keep setting a 90 BTC sell wall thats driving the price down slowly, but once any buy momentum picks up, the wall disappears, nevertheless the idiots keep selling under itCan anyone anti-shill me on TRAC? I feel like the project is very promising and the team is capable and communicative. With that being said, I always like hearing different viewpoints so that I (and whoever reads this) am better informed.Can anyone explain why ZRX is moving up? Any news? I'm at work.You don't just go adjusting the USD value, that's not how valuations and taxes and financial reports work. It doesn't matter what the company lost x years from the day it was lost, its measured at the time of loss. 

If we take into consideration BTC's value today, MtGox was much bigger, but then now we have a picture that doesn't give us relative information about the scale of damagewell well https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7t2q2c/daily_general_discussion_january_26_2018/dt9jvvo/ (:Lawd have mercy there's a fire     If MathSkill &lt; 0

       print "HODL"I appreciate the feedback. I've been watching FUN as well. Here's a better question. Distributed networks require others to get involved and support the community and tech. How does someone get involved helping build their tech. Is any of it open source? Do they just want people to shill for them?ETH people dont use elevators. We either teleport or drive our lambosCorrect. The test net might come out later this year but I doubt it will be implemented this year.ZRX is very resilient Yay bloom worth 11.8 btc each.   Rich AFokay so i added charts http://spicyblock.com but i need some traffic so the dyno doesnt go to sleep and it can generate some data pointsThat DAO situation was very different, and a fork to recover funds was much easier because of the nature of the DAO (lock up of Eth etc). This is just a bunch of random tokens on an exchange. I don't even think a fork to make everyone whole again is feasible in a situation like this. Perhaps partners is the wrong term to use for my EEA anology since it's an agreement on paper that doesn't necessarily mean they trade services. I said Ripple could only divulge one client using XRP, Cuallix which we agree on. Using being the key term here.

And to specify, I was trying to sum up the clip for the parent-comment who asked for context so don't hold me accountable for these facts you claim I got wrong, contact Bloomberg. I did however edit my initial comment to top 7 global banks as well as clarify RippleNet in relation to the Swedish anecdote.

FYI (since I'm sensing some territorial hostility in your tone): I want Ripple to succeed, more Blockchain for everyone. But at its current state, I'm dubious on XRP's role in it. Skepticism is good in this space, right? ;-)Don't remember. Could be him. Did that to me with VIU. I had over a billion dollars for a few hoursHas their fees gone down at all? When I initially started poking around their fees seemed to be a bit high, but I think the devs mentioned they would decrease once volume picked up.This is a chicken/egg situation.  A 30% increase in price will send that algo in reverse real quick. Adjusted USD value is much more during the Mt Gox hack. But not the fees plus the taxes, if youre an American. I'm saving the best one for the flippening&gt; And I think a weakening dollar is part of that.

Obviously. For a european like me, the value of your house barely changed.Yeah, I don't know about crumbling.  Buy side looks pretty thick to me.  40k Buys at $800.  28k at $900.  Yall are so dramaticAnd that kid was Albert Einstein?Centralized exchanges are so 2017&gt;  like it does on average every 8-12 years

I always thought the average was 7 yearsWhoops, edited!Yes. Similar thing for CRED on ED. This market is so brand new...
We can really only speculate, it's kinda exciting but if we look at LTC, it's still up like 3x from before the spike. 
I mean, that's the only thing I could speculate off of. aha I'm not sure you understood what chainlink is for :)Go ZRX go!Crumbling = down like $12 over the last several hours &gt; Porn sells.

Completely agree. However, theyre going to be competing against BAT to win over publishers + users. More competition in the space is always good, so Im excited to see them both in action!XRP is a trash token, theres your tldrIf you just need your keys out, click your account, and then export.  I think your get a UTC.......JSON file.   

Use MEW to access it.  Adding BAT and OMG would be divine - I'm thinking they have to be front runners. I wonder how long the pump would last...ZRX going crazy right now :O  Seems like people don't even have orders above 18k sats to sell...Sweet man. I gained back the fees I was charged. Hahahaha! I'm sorry you're *convicted*... IMO don't worry about it, Coca Cola and Nestle will take care of the water problem, no problem amigo!So se are veeery far away still It seems... ATH was only 13 days ago?!?  Feels like a crypto lifetime.ETH crumbling under whale pressure with no support. Brace for some more of that sub-1000 ETH.I always feel I am too early for stuff, I bought WTC from like 3-8$ then sold. Then forgott the real big volume pumps...
