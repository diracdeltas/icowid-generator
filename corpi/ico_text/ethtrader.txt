EDIT: this is just one of many listings.  They are hiring a ton of people to build this thing.  It's all centered on Ethereum.Hey Chaps, I wanted to invest in Symmetry ICO but found this nice summary of red flags so I thought it might help some of you. IMHO they are scam... 

-----------------------

[Source: Wolf Crypto News Telegram]

**Symmetry Fund - ICO Redflags**

If you are thinking about investing in Symmetry Fund ICO I would advise increased caution. Website and Whitepaper look very professional but digging deeper into the project, a number of red flags appear:


**1.** All LinkedIn team member profiles seem to be rather new, no recommendations present
  -&gt; they also seem not to exist outside LinkedIn / Symmetry fund website

**2:** There is no direct link between the Symmetry fund website and a real person:
-&gt; someone contacted the consulting lawyer who advised them, but he claims to never meet at any of the individuals behind the fund or saw any papers
-&gt; website of symmetry itself is registered through a hosting/DNS lookup protecting   
   construction (Domains by proxy), so is fully anonymous
https://www.whois.com/whois/symmetry.fund

**3:** all their advisors have been changed (previously members of the COSS team were mentioned, but they deny any link to it)
https://medium.com/@irfanmuhammadsyamsularief/investment-with-the-symmetry-fund-f5abafde425

**4.** Their advisor Mike Henkel also does not seem to exist, he also does not work for POLARIS Investment as claimed on the Symmetry Fund website

**5:** The advisor named Leah Kronshage was removed from the English site. When asked about it on Telegram, the admin Andrew stated: "he is an impersonator". Weird though, if you switch the language of their site to Korean, Leah is still there...

**6:** They promised to meet interested investors at the Dubai International Blockchain Summit, except no one showed up

There are better and safer investment opportunities out there. Always do your own research before investing in an ICO.

Recently i sold some of my stack in order to be able to buy the dip. I stored the FIAT on my GDAX account. Now i just check my account and see all the FIAT is gone and i suddenly have a large amount of LTC (i never bought LTC before).  I immediately sold all the LTC and transferred the money to my bankaccount. Now i see all this weird orders in my account for small amounts of LTC. I never received a message or email that someone logged in. (I use  2FA for both login and sending of funds). Please help.Blocktix has released their web app and is scheduled to release their mobile applications this week. This will be the leading complete blockchain (smart contract) based ticketing system. From their affiliations with big players in the industry, I can see Blocktix as one of the first mainstream uses of Blockchain technology that will be huge publicity for the benefits of blockchain and Ethereum. Hey guys, I already have a diversified portfolio and I reserved 1 last ETH to invest in some shill coin from Reddit. I was thinking going HAT Hawala, but they are promising fiat-crypto and I'm not sure they can delivery. So, I have 1 ETH waiting to go to some small cap coin or token but I'm out of leads.

Would you mind shilling me a coin? Low cap please, I want moon.

BTW, market will keep droping, HODL and believe, 500 billion market cap is nothing, we are just getting started.As you know Russia plan to ccept the law and legalize crypto, exchanges and exchangers. My friend has 3 domains: 1. ethereumstore.ru 2. etherstore.ru 3. ethstore.ru. How do you think an he get some money for sell them now? or maybe wait few years?I'm planning to send some ETH to get into an ICO. I expect it'll be over within minutes and I plan to complete ETH tx within a minute or two maximum. Say I wanna send 0.2 ETH via MEW - how much would you recommend for gas limit. It is automatically set at 21000. This seems a bit too high. What is the price of 1 gas? Interesting development...

https://www.rgj.com/story/money/business/2018/01/23/industrial-park-houses-tesla-gigafactory-nearly-sold-out-after-blockchains-deal/1059002001/

" Blockchains LLC, is purchasing 64,000 acres at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, with the deal expected to fully close by the first week of February, said Lance Gilman, principal and director of the industrial park.

The industrial park that plays host to Tesla, Google and Switch in the Reno area is almost sold out as a blockchain software company is finalizing plans to buy more than half of its land.

The company specializes in financial services, security, software and apps using blockchain technology  a secure digital ledger or record that is typically associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Blockchains LLC specifically deals with the Ethereum blockchain, which anchors the second-biggest cryptocurrency in the world. The Ethereum cryptocurrency is only trumped by Bitcoin in terms of market cap." 

" Blockchains will use 150 of the acres it purchased at the industrial center to build a campus park that will house the companys headquarters, Gilman said. What the company will do with the rest of the land remains to be seen.

I believe theyre going to showcase to the world everything that the blockchain technology is capable of, Gilman said. Now will they do all the work themselves or work with other developers to house other users? Only time will tell.

This might not necessarily warrant its own thread but I just wanted everyone to be aware that Coinbase (or possibly the card company) changed their merchant category code so that all credit card purchases are now treated as a cash advance. I have not confirmed this myself (only used a CC my first couple of purchases), but the reports are widespread. The change happened within the last 48 hours.

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: Thanks to /u/TrickyxWolfx for this response he received when inquiring with Chase to have the cash advance fee refunded:

&amp;nbsp;


"Hello XXX XXXX,

I am happy to assist you with the cash advance fee wavier request.

XXXX, the transaction to Coinbase dated January 20, 2018 is listed as a quasi cash transaction. It is categorized as "POI Funding Transactions(Excluding MoneySend)".

Let me share that Visa and MasterCard systems assign a category code to each merchant, based on the kinds of products and services they sell. Sometimes the system places merchants in a generalized category, like "superstores" instead of "grocery stores" or "gas stations."

I refunded your account for the two ash advance fees of $10.00 each. You'll see this adjustment on your February 9, 2018 statement.

A quasi cash transaction is one that is similar to a cash advance. Money transfers, money order purchases, gambling transactions, and other transactions where cash is accessed will be classified as quasi cash transactions. Quasi cash transactions are subject to a 5% transaction fee with a $10.00 minimum and no maximum. Also, they earn interest on a daily basis and accrue interest from the date they post to your account until paid in full.

The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for cash on your account is a variable rate of 26.24%, which is the minimum rate for cash.

We appreciate your business and thank you for being a Chase customer.

Thank you, xxxx xxxxxx"I'm creating a spreadsheet so I can keep track of everything and try to be as safe as I can be. But say you got audited even though you were being honest with your taxes, what are some things to prove to them? What are some things I should put on my spreadsheet besides my buy/sell order history? On Coinbase and GDAX when I download my CSV sometimes I see Transfer ID, Coinbase ID, Trade ID, etc, which ones am I suppose to look for and keep a record of?

According to EOS wiki [1]: 
"We expect that C++ will be the best language for developing high-performance and secure smart contracts."

Developing smart contracts has some pitfalls and can lead to vulnerabilities; we have observed them also in Ethereum's world when using solidity. However, from a technological point of view C++ is much much more difficult and therefore worse.  

As an investor you should really think about if EOS is a big deal in the long term (in case you believe in technology fundamentals)... 

[1] https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/wiki/Smart-ContractEarly bird tickets are nearly gone. Save $100 while supplies last! 

Attendees will learn everything they need to know to get started in the world of cryptocurrency as we highlight the tools and resources available to you.

All-star keynote speaker lineup to be announced soon. After party included with ticket (limited spacing).

Get your tickets: https://events.bizzabo.com/dayforcryptoit's not a huge amount but still : i've bought around 150euros worth of Eth on coinbase, and it went just a lil up from what i've bought despite the crashes. I won't bore you with the cents etc, but my account dropped from about 150 to 130euros and i have more ETH than when i've started to "invest"... Anybody has an explanation/same problem? (and i've thought about the variation of the euro itself, still doesn't make sense, it's like 20euros have gone poof)Rookie to crypto here, have some portfolio tools but all seem to present portfolio in FIAT instead of ether/btc primarily. I.e. Delta says my portfolio is x, up y while actually my portfolio in ether is down with z. So, not helpful if you're looking to grow in ether.

Any tools, tips or pointers to a portfolio site, app or something that I can use?This downed on me while reading a whitepaper *(apologies if it has been pointed out before)*:  

**Traditional enterprise**:  good ideas are locked in enterprise 'secret-sauce' vaults - the inner workings, business model of an enterprise was highly guarded (still is, and for good reason in some cases).  

**Blockchain/crypto business models**: it is all out there in whitepapers and github.  

You gotta love that!Everyone says that "if only i had spent more on X coin when it was X price!" but they forget that a lot of them would have sold early. 

so those of you who have held Eth from last January or before, how did you resist selling when it went to 20 dollars but crashed back down to 10? or how did you resist selling at 300 dollars? I'm interested in the resolve it took to hold.

What was the process? I'm in a similar position right now with another coin which i think is going to have an ETH kind of run, but you never really can tell for sure. 
zrx is the tokenI sold mine for more NEBL like 2 days ago. Fuck meI always hear these two recommended. WhyWell that's just great. I had a sell order at 0.0018.  As soon as I sell it's mooning. Just fucking great. Hallelujah!What?ZRX- Da sleeper.  Hide yo kids, hide yo wifeeeeSources?More cryptocurreny was lost during the Mt Gox hack. You lucked out with Coinbase.  They're probably the fastest, but not usually that fast. Kraken isn't known for their speed, but they're better than polo.  I had tickets open with them for over 50 days not once but twice.I don't have enough experience in C++ to comment, but I will anyway. High level languages are not necessarily safer just because they are (seemingly) easier. It might be easier to get started, but it's also easy to make a mess. I'm not saying C++ is devoid of pitfalls, but perhaps things like type checking would be advantageous.I'm sitting in a cubicle trying to get work done. It's Friday bruh I'm not staying one sec over.Well Ill be damned... 0x gdax... Tesla... This is definitely the best daily thread for crypto Hi, what is your ticket number? I can assure you there is a reason for the delay.The cryptocurrency is that you don't need trust. Did he miss the memo?This is my favorite timeline. Hope this happens in the next 3 months.Actually can't cause some weird shit with the space

"Look at their hands. They seem unnatural in the photos" lolFOMO'd yesterday. Very low cap. Won award from walmart. Big Partnerships already in place. depends on how detailed and accurate the specs are. Development is actually really fast when you know exactly what you have to do. Compare the looks of both charts and tell me
We only benefit when BTC goes side ways Well, I guess we're going in either of two directions once this channel closes in:

Hopefully we blow through 1106 with some volume.It's been a good two weeks and none of us have seen any of our money. Kraken has been emailing us telling us to keep waiting and that they are working on it but no action has been taken and it's starting to hurt my bottom line. I rely on trading for a living and taking my trading capital is essentially taking away my income. 

Worse yet I got a newsletter email last night that they re-enabled margin trading on their platform and have yet to clean up their mess. Seems unprofessional and risky at best.

Please take care of your clients in a timely manner.

pinging /u/dont_forget_canada /u/Kraken-Tyler /u/kraken-jpjHave any of the recent bull runs been the direct result of positive news? The EEA certainly drove the March-June run. But since then I am not sure that's been the case. It may be a fools errand to try and time these movements with expectations about DAPPs going live, ETH futures announcements, protocol upgrades, etc. CONGRATS YOU DONT BELIEVE IN GOD.  YOU DONT NEED TO BE A VEGAN ABOUT IT.  I can't say for certain but I've been seeing ZRX a lot more in the news, and the biggest dollar value (at the time) crypto hack ever wouldn't surprise me as a key catalyst. Damn, rip to whoever fat-fingeredOmg, my eyes Blockfolio.  Some dodgy ED trade.I don't believe it does confirm it. bitcoin's mempool is full, so there was a hard limit to the number of transactions, that chart only really demonstrates that more people want to use bitcoin than can fit on the chain, and that Ethereum isn't yet being held back by that to the same extent. The scaling is very important, and I prefer ETH, but I don't think the 10X increase follows as a correlation with scaling. As Bitcoin's graph shows (so far) it is possible for price to not be correlated with T#.Throwaway was a shill,but go ZRX!30th January 2018, Coinbase, Nasdaq, Dubai, Google, Tesla, ZRX ETH RLC OMG, JesusChrist, he is a sheits finally deserving recognition it deservesIn other words, Eth is still tied at the hip with BTC fluctuations?its a great holdZRX finally seeing its day! strong hold! ThrowAWAY was right!Could be. Hope it's not a targeted p&amp;d.It was on cnbc as the next big coin I just got a notice on my Toshi app (developed by Coinbase) that they are making a dex that is utilizing 0x.

Smells like Moon Spirit.25%This is definitely one of the most undervalued projects in the space. Once they get the fiat gateway live it will be a great way to get passive investors in the space and bring tons of fiat into the space.Following, because almost FOMOing on TRAC new ezpz account ?you can reddit but can't look up news at work? if we reach 0.5 with BTC then BTC would simply die, our marketcap would be triple that of BTC, and our Technology is already 100 times better, media will only focus on the winner and discuss how outdated BTC isguys what's happening with 0x? wooI'm hoping that the early adopters/big holders who care about crypto have cashed out enough to leave lots of USD/USDT with limit buys across the big exchanges to support any significant dips, more than anyone trying to cause a panic. But who knows.

The crazy thing about so many believing that there will be a selloff whenever someone says contracts close is it's a self fulfilling prophecy... dump and pump.Lol where??I still think you're attributing this based on the wrong chart, it's BTC that's falling and bots are just making sure we don't take over. A bot keep setting a 90 BTC sell wall thats driving the price down slowly, but once any buy momentum picks up, the wall disappears, nevertheless the idiots keep selling under itCan anyone anti-shill me on TRAC? I feel like the project is very promising and the team is capable and communicative. With that being said, I always like hearing different viewpoints so that I (and whoever reads this) am better informed.Can anyone explain why ZRX is moving up? Any news? I'm at work.You don't just go adjusting the USD value, that's not how valuations and taxes and financial reports work. It doesn't matter what the company lost x years from the day it was lost, its measured at the time of loss. 

If we take into consideration BTC's value today, MtGox was much bigger, but then now we have a picture that doesn't give us relative information about the scale of damagewell well https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7t2q2c/daily_general_discussion_january_26_2018/dt9jvvo/ (:Lawd have mercy there's a fire     If MathSkill &lt; 0

       print "moon"

    else 
       print "HODL"I appreciate the feedback. I've been watching FUN as well. Here's a better question. Distributed networks require others to get involved and support the community and tech. How does someone get involved helping build their tech. Is any of it open source? Do they just want people to shill for them?ETH people dont use elevators. We either teleport or drive our lambosCorrect. The test net might come out later this year but I doubt it will be implemented this year.ZRX is very resilient Yay bloom worth 11.8 btc each.   Rich AFokay so i added charts http://spicyblock.com but i need some traffic so the dyno doesnt go to sleep and it can generate some data pointsThat DAO situation was very different, and a fork to recover funds was much easier because of the nature of the DAO (lock up of Eth etc). This is just a bunch of random tokens on an exchange. I don't even think a fork to make everyone whole again is feasible in a situation like this. Perhaps partners is the wrong term to use for my EEA anology since it's an agreement on paper that doesn't necessarily mean they trade services. I said Ripple could only divulge one client using XRP, Cuallix which we agree on. Using being the key term here.

And to specify, I was trying to sum up the clip for the parent-comment who asked for context so don't hold me accountable for these facts you claim I got wrong, contact Bloomberg. I did however edit my initial comment to top 7 global banks as well as clarify RippleNet in relation to the Swedish anecdote.

FYI (since I'm sensing some territorial hostility in your tone): I want Ripple to succeed, more Blockchain for everyone. But at its current state, I'm dubious on XRP's role in it. Skepticism is good in this space, right? ;-)Don't remember. Could be him. Did that to me with VIU. I had over a billion dollars for a few hoursHas their fees gone down at all? When I initially started poking around their fees seemed to be a bit high, but I think the devs mentioned they would decrease once volume picked up.This is a chicken/egg situation.  A 30% increase in price will send that algo in reverse real quick. Adjusted USD value is much more during the Mt Gox hack. But not the fees plus the taxes, if youre an American. I'm saving the best one for the flippening&gt; And I think a weakening dollar is part of that.

Obviously. For a european like me, the value of your house barely changed.Yeah, I don't know about crumbling.  Buy side looks pretty thick to me.  40k Buys at $800.  28k at $900.  Yall are so dramaticAnd that kid was Albert Einstein?Centralized exchanges are so 2017&gt;  like it does on average every 8-12 years

I always thought the average was 7 yearsWhoops, edited!Yes. Similar thing for CRED on ED. This market is so brand new...
We can really only speculate, it's kinda exciting but if we look at LTC, it's still up like 3x from before the spike. 
I mean, that's the only thing I could speculate off of. aha I'm not sure you understood what chainlink is for :)Go ZRX go!Crumbling = down like $12 over the last several hours &gt; Porn sells.

Completely agree. However, theyre going to be competing against BAT to win over publishers + users. More competition in the space is always good, so Im excited to see them both in action!XRP is a trash token, theres your tldrIf you just need your keys out, click your account, and then export.  I think your get a UTC.......JSON file.   

Use MEW to access it.  Adding BAT and OMG would be divine - I'm thinking they have to be front runners. I wonder how long the pump would last...ZRX going crazy right now :O  Seems like people don't even have orders above 18k sats to sell...Sweet man. I gained back the fees I was charged. Hahahaha! I'm sorry you're *convicted*... IMO don't worry about it, Coca Cola and Nestle will take care of the water problem, no problem amigo!So se are veeery far away still It seems... ATH was only 13 days ago?!?  Feels like a crypto lifetime.ETH crumbling under whale pressure with no support. Brace for some more of that sub-1000 ETH.I always feel I am too early for stuff, I bought WTC from like 3-8$ then sold. Then forgott the real big volume pumps...

https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@matthew-analysis/daily-crypto-analysis-26th-jan-technical-analysisPlease take this with a grain of salt, there are no facts on anything that I'll be presenting, and this post is full of speculation and assumption.

By now you may have heard that Vince McMahon is planning on bringing back the XFL following the 2019-2020 NFL regular season, and you're probably thinking, "Why in the world would he do that?"  The former Xtreme Football League only lasted one season and was a horrible attempt at competing against the NFL, however, I think a new league can hold merit.

Several FAQs from the current XFL.com website:
*An opportunity exists to reimagine Americas favorite sport by putting fans at the center while leveraging a changing media landscape and evolving consumer viewing behavior.
*The new XFL is a single entity structure with plans for eight teams at launch, all of which will be owned by the league.
*The players' salary structure is still in development, but players will be paid to play and paid more to win.

Additionally, Vince McMahon aims to "re-imagine" football, and despite the former failed XFL venture, he is a proven businessman with a strong ability to make money.

Still, it sounds crazy and many are assuming it will fail again.  I like to try to see both sides, and Vince McMahon is a person who likes to be on the forefront new and radical ideas.  He took the Olympic sport of wrestling and transformed it into an entertaining global spectacle, and managed to raise his net worth to an excess of $1 Billion.  I'm not going to be so quick to dismiss his ideas and track record.

Now, why I think he can pull this off:
'Fans' are not going to exist early on, because there is no history or fandom to be had, thus we'll need to add incentive.  As a potential consumer, what would generate my interest?  Incentive and a lot of it.
*Give spectators the opportunity to control the game, so they have built in stake, similar to this idea (https://fcfl.io/thank-you.php?__s=uq1p6p2xkhgsthtbhpwp).  By tuning into the game, I can vote on which plays I want to be called, but let's take it even a step further.  
*Discounts - in stadium discounts for attending, correctly choosing plays, etc.
*Player endorsement incentives - We remember Rod "He Hate Me" Smart, but what if we had Tom "Amazon" Brady.  Give players the right to sell the name on their back to highest bid
*Fractional Team Ownership - The XFL can sell off fractions of each team and you can become the GM.  Fandom and viewership doesn't have to stop on Sundays.  You can now help negotiate the day-to-days through consensus ownership
*True fan loyalty - We all know someone that flip flops their fandom, but what if you were rewarded for staking your fandom based on length of time?
*Other things to be voted on: rules/regulations, team names and future locations, jersey colors and logos, etc.

Just a few small ideas, but the more I think about it, the more I think it can make sense.  Would love to hear everyone's thoughts
Seems like Joseph Lubin lied on national TV about incoming Ethereum futures. He said any day now and it's been months.

-----------------------

[Source: Wolf Crypto News Telegram]

**Symmetry Fund - ICO Redflags**

If you are thinking about investing in Symmetry Fund ICO I would advise increased caution. Website and Whitepaper look very professional but digging deeper into the project, a number of red flags appear:


**1.** All LinkedIn team member profiles seem to be rather new, no recommendations present
  -&gt; they also seem not to exist outside LinkedIn / Symmetry fund website

**2:** There is no direct link between the Symmetry fund website and a real person:
-&gt; someone contacted the consulting lawyer who advised them, but he claims to never meet at any of the individuals behind the fund or saw any papers
-&gt; website of symmetry itself is registered through a hosting/DNS lookup protecting   
   construction (Domains by proxy), so is fully anonymous
https://www.whois.com/whois/symmetry.fund

**3:** all their advisors have been changed (previously members of the COSS team were mentioned, but they deny any link to it)
https://medium.com/@irfanmuhammadsyamsularief/investment-with-the-symmetry-fund-f5abafde425

**4.** Their advisor Mike Henkel also does not seem to exist, he also does not work for POLARIS Investment as claimed on the Symmetry Fund website

**5:** The advisor named Leah Kronshage was removed from the English site. When asked about it on Telegram, the admin Andrew stated: "he is an impersonator". Weird though, if you switch the language of their site to Korean, Leah is still there...

**6:** They promised to meet interested investors at the Dubai International Blockchain Summit, except no one showed up

There are better and safer investment opportunities out there. Always do your own research before investing in an ICO.

Recently i sold some of my stack in order to be able to buy the dip. I stored the FIAT on my GDAX account. Now i just check my account and see all the FIAT is gone and i suddenly have a large amount of LTC (i never bought LTC before).  I immediately sold all the LTC and transferred the money to my bankaccount. Now i see all this weird orders in my account for small amounts of LTC. I never received a message or email that someone logged in. (I use  2FA for both login and sending of funds). Please help.Blocktix has released their web app and is scheduled to release their mobile applications this week. This will be the leading complete blockchain (smart contract) based ticketing system. From their affiliations with big players in the industry, I can see Blocktix as one of the first mainstream uses of Blockchain technology that will be huge publicity for the benefits of blockchain and Ethereum. Hey guys, I already have a diversified portfolio and I reserved 1 last ETH to invest in some shill coin from Reddit. I was thinking going HAT Hawala, but they are promising fiat-crypto and I'm not sure they can delivery. So, I have 1 ETH waiting to go to some small cap coin or token but I'm out of leads.

Would you mind shilling me a coin? Low cap please, I want moon.

BTW, market will keep droping, HODL and believe, 500 billion market cap is nothing, we are just getting started.As you know Russia plan to ccept the law and legalize crypto, exchanges and exchangers. My friend has 3 domains: 1. ethereumstore.ru 2. etherstore.ru 3. ethstore.ru. How do you think an he get some money for sell them now? or maybe wait few years?I'm planning to send some ETH to get into an ICO. I expect it'll be over within minutes and I plan to complete ETH tx within a minute or two maximum. Say I wanna send 0.2 ETH via MEW - how much would you recommend for gas limit. It is automatically set at 21000. This seems a bit too high. What is the price of 1 gas? Interesting development...

https://www.rgj.com/story/money/business/2018/01/23/industrial-park-houses-tesla-gigafactory-nearly-sold-out-after-blockchains-deal/1059002001/

" Blockchains LLC, is purchasing 64,000 acres at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, with the deal expected to fully close by the first week of February, said Lance Gilman, principal and director of the industrial park.

The industrial park that plays host to Tesla, Google and Switch in the Reno area is almost sold out as a blockchain software company is finalizing plans to buy more than half of its land.

The company specializes in financial services, security, software and apps using blockchain technology  a secure digital ledger or record that is typically associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Blockchains LLC specifically deals with the Ethereum blockchain, which anchors the second-biggest cryptocurrency in the world. The Ethereum cryptocurrency is only trumped by Bitcoin in terms of market cap." 

" Blockchains will use 150 of the acres it purchased at the industrial center to build a campus park that will house the companys headquarters, Gilman said. What the company will do with the rest of the land remains to be seen.

I believe theyre going to showcase to the world everything that the blockchain technology is capable of, Gilman said. Now will they do all the work themselves or work with other developers to house other users? Only time will tell.

This might not necessarily warrant its own thread but I just wanted everyone to be aware that Coinbase (or possibly the card company) changed their merchant category code so that all credit card purchases are now treated as a cash advance. I have not confirmed this myself (only used a CC my first couple of purchases), but the reports are widespread. The change happened within the last 48 hours.

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: Thanks to /u/TrickyxWolfx for this response he received when inquiring with Chase to have the cash advance fee refunded:

&amp;nbsp;


"Hello XXX XXXX,

I am happy to assist you with the cash advance fee wavier request.

XXXX, the transaction to Coinbase dated January 20, 2018 is listed as a quasi cash transaction. It is categorized as "POI Funding Transactions(Excluding MoneySend)".

Let me share that Visa and MasterCard systems assign a category code to each merchant, based on the kinds of products and services they sell. Sometimes the system places merchants in a generalized category, like "superstores" instead of "grocery stores" or "gas stations."

I refunded your account for the two ash advance fees of $10.00 each. You'll see this adjustment on your February 9, 2018 statement.

A quasi cash transaction is one that is similar to a cash advance. Money transfers, money order purchases, gambling transactions, and other transactions where cash is accessed will be classified as quasi cash transactions. Quasi cash transactions are subject to a 5% transaction fee with a $10.00 minimum and no maximum. Also, they earn interest on a daily basis and accrue interest from the date they post to your account until paid in full.

The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for cash on your account is a variable rate of 26.24%, which is the minimum rate for cash.

We appreciate your business and thank you for being a Chase customer.

Thank you, xxxx xxxxxx"I'm creating a spreadsheet so I can keep track of everything and try to be as safe as I can be. But say you got audited even though you were being honest with your taxes, what are some things to prove to them? What are some things I should put on my spreadsheet besides my buy/sell order history? On Coinbase and GDAX when I download my CSV sometimes I see Transfer ID, Coinbase ID, Trade ID, etc, which ones am I suppose to look for and keep a record of?

According to EOS wiki [1]: 
"We expect that C++ will be the best language for developing high-performance and secure smart contracts."

Developing smart contracts has some pitfalls and can lead to vulnerabilities; we have observed them also in Ethereum's world when using solidity. However, from a technological point of view C++ is much much more difficult and therefore worse.  

As an investor you should really think about if EOS is a big deal in the long term (in case you believe in technology fundamentals)...

All-star keynote speaker lineup to be announced soon. After party included with ticket (limited spacing).

Get your tickets: https://events.bizzabo.com/dayforcryptoit's not a huge amount but still : i've bought around 150euros worth of Eth on coinbase, and it went just a lil up from what i've bought despite the crashes. I won't bore you with the cents etc, but my account dropped from about 150 to 130euros and i have more ETH than when i've started to "invest"... Anybody has an explanation/same problem? (and i've thought about the variation of the euro itself, still doesn't make sense, it's like 20euros have gone poof)Rookie to crypto here, have some portfolio tools but all seem to present portfolio in FIAT instead of ether/btc primarily. I.e. Delta says my portfolio is x, up y while actually my portfolio in ether is down with z. So, not helpful if you're looking to grow in ether.

Any tools, tips or pointers to a portfolio site, app or something that I can use?I don't know exactly but it's a least very sluggish transactions.I posted similar thoughts on ripple (formerly ripple labs) and about xrp and just raising questions in utility and store of value. The company loves it because it makes them billionaires but was never their intent. Received like a bag of rocks, I was thrown out as a fudster except for the mod who was curious. Ps I worked in a bank and reviewed early use cases for ripple.Not sure what issue you are suggesting.... Id say use MEW, not the Chrome Application. Then they (he and she) are truly the one that was foretoldwhat do you exactly mean? i cannot use my nano ledger? Chihuahua's Red Rocket?Can we talk about Stellar vs. OMG? I own both, but I'm thinking of selling my Stellar +profits for more OMG.

Thoughts?Username checks out.They have an api/app problem since some days ago*skeptically buys zrx*This bothers me a lot. If blockchain is so decentralised how come it is so easy traced back to an individual? What is stopping the gov to just block all exchange and no one can get their money out?Double-check your balance then! Do they have an actual routing system yet?  Because if not and they're still brute-forcing it as a full broadcast network... It's not going to be a scaling solution.I think it's worldwide https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7t2t1y/psa_buying_crypto_with_a_cc_on_coinbase/Definitely satirical.Oh, cool.Oh Boy!

Am I an old person not understanding all this new shit now? :( We got some itty bitty 6h cuecombers, let me tell you what.Any fellow Canadians out there that can confirm what changes coinbase has made? Something about extra cash advance fees or something? Sounds like a successful strategy. Do you ever sell out completely? I like to always keep some of the stack.Yeah, I thought it would hit 1.90 again, but too late it seemsthere were folks here saying she deleted because NEO pumped after she said that. i dont believe that to be true, but i do believe she knows something about NEO that we don't..Damn here comes ZRX againIt's already too late. Everyone has screenshots Is large ok?She's definitely got some insider info, but looks like she also suggested selling NEO literally the day before its big pump.  I'd say use the info, don't follow the trading advice, heh.I'm dumb. Context?Sharding is arguably more important than POS.

It's what's needed if we want Eth to get to Visa levels of transactions.I guess we'll see.
It dropped to like 1.30 about a week or two ago already Yeah, was definitely off on that one. NEO 2x'ed within 3-4 days of that post.I mean, Starbucks already sounds like a crypto currency.they're still pretty heavy lol"sharding" will never stop making me giggleGlad I could helpWill it be too much of an ask to provide a high level one liners for each of these things?

ezpz defies your silly definitions. He's a champ, plain and simple. He suffered for our gains.Yeah I think the Nov./Dec. hype brought in tons of new money, and then the drop scared them away.

But..now I know what you mean.Thanks!cool good to know cryptothrowaway324 might as well be the new Satoshi Nakamoto Yea, it's ultimately all up to how you like to trade alts.  Ultimately, ETH is the only thing I truly believe in with crypto, so every trade I make is to gain more ETH.  I'm a bit more conservative than most and like to start scaling out of alt positions a little earlier than most.  I'm also a big believer in 'sell the news', so I start accelerating my sells as we get closer to expected news.  Some questions about EZPZ, is he...

- [A stupid kid](https://strawpoll.com/213zfrwf)
- [A crazy depressed person who regrets selling his ETH](https://strawpoll.com/213zfrwf)
- [A person who truly believes in what he thinks](https://strawpoll.com/213zfrwf)
- [A troll who's loving this shit](https://strawpoll.com/213zfrwf)And in 1 year, 1 ether will cost more than one bitcoin.Closer to 4,000%, but who's counting :-)

Think I should sell yet?  lolperhaps its Satoshi making a come backBATShe didntNot sure, bought some yesterday because it was new to kucoin. But Ethically i wont shill it because I dont know yet.There were a few more near the end of her time here. Can't recall which onesI bought in at like 1.92 before it dipped.There are too many shotcoins man - you went full retard... never go full retard.Could you explain a bit further? I'm aware of the potential of PoS but not so much on sharding?Is ICN down from ICO?
I've been thinking of getting some.Interesting thing is that the CMC ETH price is above the price needed to break the pennant and GDAX is lagging by ~$10. We see this most frequently when GDAX is the last one to break through a USD psychological barrier. That might be the load up needed to set the arb bots up for a break through with volume. TBD.I hear ya man, gotta respect the nice round numbers!Bot as in singular. But I meant a single entity (which may contain multiple bots working together)

Edit: I wish AIDSFinex didnt infect the eth network with its TAIDS.In about a month, 1 Ethereum will cost more than 1 Bitcoin Cash. Been comparing the trend data for both and Bitcoin Cash is on a downwards trajectory, being pulled at a faster deceleration rate by Bitcoin than Ethereum. From my projections, 1 ETH will cost more than 1 BCH by the 24th of February.Yea, though said it would be later in the year, IIRC.  It's hard not to like this ETH ratio for buying OMG right now, though.Starbucks Korea already working with Qtum...let me guessWelcome to the Daily Altcoin Discussion thread of /r/EthTrader.

/r/binance $10+ ETH withdrawal fee is ridiculous. I love the platform, but I am getting transactions cleared on the Ethereum network within minutes for $0.75. This is theft, and other exchanges are not charging these absurd fees. I was not really sensitive to this before, as I was moving large amounts, but I needed to move a little ETH to an address for gas purposes and realised how crazy 0.01 is. The minimum withdrawal is 0.1, and 0.01 represents 10% of this. Just pure insanity.

EDIT: Title should read: 0.01, not 0.10, but post content is correct.I'm curious as to what opinions/basis people have for what would happen to cryptomarkets, and commodities (gold, silver, etc.) If the stock market as a whole took a relatively large downturn?I keep posting everywhere but it seems I can't reach anyone, so I guess I'll comment here where it all began. I lost all my eth today, and I don't know what to do. I had all my coins at coincheck and they were hacked and stopped withdrawals seems they will go down, and I lost everything. I don't ask for sympathy, but does anyone know of anything I can do? I had other coins in there too, which was very valuable but, I keep trying to reach people, and I don't know where to go now. The main problem is I'm not Japanese and can't do anything. Does anyone know if the exchange might come back?

Edit: I think my comments aren't going through, so I'll write here, I'm hearing now that some news articles are saying that the exchange might not return in Japan, this really has me nervous. https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXMZO26234720X20C18A1MM0000/?nf=1
I don't know if to retain hope, I had done this for my son, so I'm kind of freaking out.I've been using Gemini for trading now for quite a while with no real issues. Today I tried to do a trade and it says my account is frozen and unable to transfer funds or trade. I have not tried to add additional funds or modify the account in any way recently. Has anyone encountered this before? I have contacted them I am just concerned that they will be slow in responding (as they have been in the past)

I've tried searching around for anyone in the same situation and after reading about others I am beginning to get concerned. Its difficult to follow up on any posts to see what the outcome was, but I could really use some reassurance at the moment.

If anyone has had their Gemini account locked at some point in the last few months could you please respond and let me know how your situation was resolved. Thank you. Not trying to spread FUD, I'm just concerned (and irritated).https://i.imgur.com/280O8u5.jpg

A very impactful name in the cryptocurrency community (current united nations block chain advisor {new position as of this year}) was giving a lot of interviews this past week at Davos with a make America great again hat on. Knowing him personally it makes me wonder if the community has any idea of background regarding the faces that are representing us.

To clarify: When I went to high school with him he wore militarized gear with nazi salutes often writing lengthy threatening posts under the pics of him saluting about harming others in one of America's most Jewish towns. He thinks he's in the illuminati (not confirmed if he actually is lol). During this time he found bitcoin and was the first in our state to successfully mine with his super computer he built called the Hive (it's quite impressive i'll give him that). He then threatened the entire police force in our town and they had to arrest him for the threats, when he payed his way out he put threats on certain officers families after heated Facebook arguments (remember the hat). Our high school added extra security during this time. He got out of all that due to his dad being highly ranked at the UN (how he got the current advisor job) then went into exile into Thailand. During this time he got married and had kids with a fellow classmate. Few years later he snaps and pulls out an AR on random people in Thailand, once again dad bails him out and the press protects him after the initial story airs. He then beats his wife and maid after seeking exile in Thailand. His wife gets out of Thailand and he's put into Thai jail until you guessed it dad makes a few calls. Most recently he fucked over a mutual buddy that gave him shelter after he was allowed back into America under Trump. (He has strings with people at Trump's Whitehouse it seems...not confirmed). He felt he could fuck my buddy over because he" holds power that people value and want more of" hence why we are posting this. I wish I couldn't make this up. Once the proper discussion is brought forth I'd be glad to share proof of everything. 

How are we going to let this happen? More standards need to be set forth or people like this will represent us with embarrassment. This post is partially made to trash him because he is a POS but it is made to bring to light some issues in the community. I hope a proper discussion comes of this about qualifications of representation.Hi guys,

So I've been hodling for a few months and it's a great way to insure you're good to go.

However, recently, I've decided to use a few Ks to try and daytrade on the ETH, just for fun. Not really pro active, and few limit orders a day (3-4), the classical buy low, sell high(er), buy lower, sell higher. 

I managed to make a few hundreds during that time, and around 1 ETH, even when the market was correcting.

However today, having bought at 850, I saw it dip to 800, then read the news about Coincheck. I thought it was going to drop even more so I decided to realise the loss and sell, to buy lower. It did not dip and instead went back up to 850.

So I lost money on the sale, and now if I buy back, I'm losing ETH. Double loss. 

What did I do wrong, what should I have done differently? Stop order? Bad reading of the markets?

https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@matthew-analysis/daily-crypto-analysis-26th-jan-technical-analysisPlease take this with a grain of salt, there are no facts on anything that I'll be presenting, and this post is full of speculation and assumption.

By now you may have heard that Vince McMahon is planning on bringing back the XFL following the 2019-2020 NFL regular season, and you're probably thinking, "Why in the world would he do that?"  The former Xtreme Football League only lasted one season and was a horrible attempt at competing against the NFL, however, I think a new league can hold merit.

Several FAQs from the current XFL.com website:
*An opportunity exists to reimagine Americas favorite sport by putting fans at the center while leveraging a changing media landscape and evolving consumer viewing behavior.
*The new XFL is a single entity structure with plans for eight teams at launch, all of which will be owned by the league.
*The players' salary structure is still in development, but players will be paid to play and paid more to win.

Additionally, Vince McMahon aims to "re-imagine" football, and despite the former failed XFL venture, he is a proven businessman with a strong ability to make money.

Still, it sounds crazy and many are assuming it will fail again.  I like to try to see both sides, and Vince McMahon is a person who likes to be on the forefront new and radical ideas.  He took the Olympic sport of wrestling and transformed it into an entertaining global spectacle, and managed to raise his net worth to an excess of $1 Billion.  I'm not going to be so quick to dismiss his ideas and track record.

Now, why I think he can pull this off:
'Fans' are not going to exist early on, because there is no history or fandom to be had, thus we'll need to add incentive.  As a potential consumer, what would generate my interest?  Incentive and a lot of it.
*Give spectators the opportunity to control the game, so they have built in stake, similar to this idea (https://fcfl.io/thank-you.php?__s=uq1p6p2xkhgsthtbhpwp).  By tuning into the game, I can vote on which plays I want to be called, but let's take it even a step further.  
*Discounts - in stadium discounts for attending, correctly choosing plays, etc.
*Player endorsement incentives - We remember Rod "He Hate Me" Smart, but what if we had Tom "Amazon" Brady.  Give players the right to sell the name on their back to highest bid
*Fractional Team Ownership - The XFL can sell off fractions of each team and you can become the GM.  Fandom and viewership doesn't have to stop on Sundays.  You can now help negotiate the day-to-days through consensus ownership
*True fan loyalty - We all know someone that flip flops their fandom, but what if you were rewarded for staking your fandom based on length of time?
*Other things to be voted on: rules/regulations, team names and future locations, jersey colors and logos, etc.

Just a few small ideas, but the more I think about it, the more I think it can make sense.  Would love to hear everyone's thoughts

EDIT: this is just one of many listings.  They are hiring a ton of people to build this thing.  It's all centered on Ethereum.Hey Chaps, I wanted to invest in Symmetry ICO but found this nice summary of red flags so I thought it might help some of you. IMHO they are scam... 

-----------------------

[Source: Wolf Crypto News Telegram]

**Symmetry Fund - ICO Redflags**

If you are thinking about investing in Symmetry Fund ICO I would advise increased caution. Website and Whitepaper look very professional but digging deeper into the project, a number of red flags appear:


**1.** All LinkedIn team member profiles seem to be rather new, no recommendations present
  -&gt; they also seem not to exist outside LinkedIn / Symmetry fund website

**2:** There is no direct link between the Symmetry fund website and a real person:
-&gt; someone contacted the consulting lawyer who advised them, but he claims to never meet at any of the individuals behind the fund or saw any papers
-&gt; website of symmetry itself is registered through a hosting/DNS lookup protecting   
   construction (Domains by proxy), so is fully anonymous
https://www.whois.com/whois/symmetry.fund

**3:** all their advisors have been changed (previously members of the COSS team were mentioned, but they deny any link to it)
https://medium.com/@irfanmuhammadsyamsularief/investment-with-the-symmetry-fund-f5abafde425

**4.** Their advisor Mike Henkel also does not seem to exist, he also does not work for POLARIS Investment as claimed on the Symmetry Fund website

**5:** The advisor named Leah Kronshage was removed from the English site. When asked about it on Telegram, the admin Andrew stated: "he is an impersonator". Weird though, if you switch the language of their site to Korean, Leah is still there...
https://symmetry.fund/#team
https://symmetry.fund/kr/#team

**6:** They promised to meet interested investors at the Dubai International Blockchain Summit, except no one showed up

There are better and safer investment opportunities out there. Always do your own research before investing in an ICO.

Recently i sold some of my stack in order to be able to buy the dip. I stored the FIAT on my GDAX account. Now i just check my account and see all the FIAT is gone and i suddenly have a large amount of LTC (i never bought LTC before).  I immediately sold all the LTC and transferred the money to my bankaccount. Now i see all this weird orders in my account for small amounts of LTC. I never received a message or email that someone logged in. (I use  2FA for both login and sending of funds). Please help.Blocktix has released their web app and is scheduled to release their mobile applications this week. This will be the leading complete blockchain (smart contract) based ticketing system. From their affiliations with big players in the industry, I can see Blocktix as one of the first mainstream uses of Blockchain technology that will be huge publicity for the benefits of blockchain and Ethereum. Hey guys, I already have a diversified portfolio and I reserved 1 last ETH to invest in some shill coin from Reddit. I was thinking going HAT Hawala, but they are promising fiat-crypto and I'm not sure they can delivery. So, I have 1 ETH waiting to go to some small cap coin or token but I'm out of leads.

Would you mind shilling me a coin? Low cap please, I want moon.

BTW, market will keep droping, HODL and believe, 500 billion market cap is nothing, we are just getting started.As you know Russia plan to ccept the law and legalize crypto, exchanges and exchangers. My friend has 3 domains: 1. ethereumstore.ru 2. etherstore.ru 3. ethstore.ru. How do you think an he get some money for sell them now? or maybe wait few years?I'm planning to send some ETH to get into an ICO. I expect it'll be over within minutes and I plan to complete ETH tx within a minute or two maximum. Say I wanna send 0.2 ETH via MEW - how much would you recommend for gas limit. It is automatically set at 21000. This seems a bit too high. What is the price of 1 gas? Interesting development...

https://www.rgj.com/story/money/business/2018/01/23/industrial-park-houses-tesla-gigafactory-nearly-sold-out-after-blockchains-deal/1059002001/

" Blockchains LLC, is purchasing 64,000 acres at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, with the deal expected to fully close by the first week of February, said Lance Gilman, principal and director of the industrial park.

The industrial park that plays host to Tesla, Google and Switch in the Reno area is almost sold out as a blockchain software company is finalizing plans to buy more than half of its land.

The company specializes in financial services, security, software and apps using blockchain technology  a secure digital ledger or record that is typically associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Blockchains LLC specifically deals with the Ethereum blockchain, which anchors the second-biggest cryptocurrency in the world. The Ethereum cryptocurrency is only trumped by Bitcoin in terms of market cap." 

" Blockchains will use 150 of the acres it purchased at the industrial center to build a campus park that will house the companys headquarters, Gilman said. What the company will do with the rest of the land remains to be seen.

I believe theyre going to showcase to the world everything that the blockchain technology is capable of, Gilman said. Now will they do all the work themselves or work with other developers to house other users? Only time will tell.

This might not necessarily warrant its own thread but I just wanted everyone to be aware that Coinbase (or possibly the card company) changed their merchant category code so that all credit card purchases are now treated as a cash advance. I have not confirmed this myself (only used a CC my first couple of purchases), but the reports are widespread. The change happened within the last 48 hours.

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: Thanks to /u/TrickyxWolfx for this response he received when inquiring with Chase to have the cash advance fee refunded:

&amp;nbsp;


"Hello XXX XXXX,

I am happy to assist you with the cash advance fee wavier request.

XXXX, the transaction to Coinbase dated January 20, 2018 is listed as a quasi cash transaction. It is categorized as "POI Funding Transactions(Excluding MoneySend)".

Let me share that Visa and MasterCard systems assign a category code to each merchant, based on the kinds of products and services they sell. Sometimes the system places merchants in a generalized category, like "superstores" instead of "grocery stores" or "gas stations."

I refunded your account for the two ash advance fees of $10.00 each. You'll see this adjustment on your February 9, 2018 statement.

A quasi cash transaction is one that is similar to a cash advance. Money transfers, money order purchases, gambling transactions, and other transactions where cash is accessed will be classified as quasi cash transactions. Quasi cash transactions are subject to a 5% transaction fee with a $10.00 minimum and no maximum. Also, they earn interest on a daily basis and accrue interest from the date they post to your account until paid in full.

The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for cash on your account is a variable rate of 26.24%, which is the minimum rate for cash.

We appreciate your business and thank you for being a Chase customer.

Thank you, xxxx xxxxxx"I'm creating a spreadsheet so I can keep track of everything and try to be as safe as I can be. But say you got audited even though you were being honest with your taxes, what are some things to prove to them? What are some things I should put on my spreadsheet besides my buy/sell order history? On Coinbase and GDAX when I download my CSV sometimes I see Transfer ID, Coinbase ID, Trade ID, etc, which ones am I suppose to look for and keep a record of?

According to EOS wiki [1]: 
"We expect that C++ will be the best language for developing high-performance and secure smart contracts."

Developing smart contracts has some pitfalls and can lead to vulnerabilities; we have observed them also in Ethereum's world when using solidity. However, from a technological point of view C++ is much much more difficult and therefore worse.  

As an investor you should really think about if EOS is a big deal in the long term (in case you believe in technology fundamentals)...

A "Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game Card Game".  Thats the most idiotic thing i have ever heard.
Nice buzzwords tho.

Euro bros. You get this thing past $1100 tonight and Ill personally shave all your womens armpits  so you can see how glorious it feels to lick a ladys armpits. Im open to other favors as well Me either
You lucked cause your a small populous and most dont have much money, so youre insignificant.  The states are a bigger fish!AwsomeI never understood why OMG is being nerfed so much.Exactly. Trying to trigger panic sells and stop loss orders to maximize his profits.Im using radarrelay to buy rnHaha I remember I was so scared of xrp plummeting down , when I saw it's massive uptrend from .40 to .47 I jumped off, I thought that was it. Sleep ? Who sleeps here i have my phone projecting the gdax charts on my ceiling when i sleep so i never miss anything Hawaii checking in...wide awake!What evidence have you found? You know that ethereum has raiden and plasma right?
Ethereum is technically better than bitcoin in literally every possible aspect. There seems to be an opinion on these individual crypto coin sub reddits, especially ethereum, that there is only 1 "true coin".  

Every top coin/token is overpriced except Etheruem is the main take away from this subreddit.  This is coming from someone who has 25-30% of my crypto value on Ethereum.What boggles my mind is that OMG was $12.00 about 7 months ago. While everything else grew, its done very little. And its currently $16. Its due for a serious insane breakout ZRX General Discussion?Learning how to move coins around is pretty important, as that is the whole reason any of these coins have value. 

If you're not japanese, why are you holding all your coins on a japanese exchange?looks like we broke the wedge upwardsIts starting to climb at an unusual hour than what Ive been seeing lately. So somethings up. The train is gonna leave while some of us are sleeping. Luckily I sleep with one eye open on the candles chart.Where do I trade this?

edit: https://www.kucoin.com/#/trade.pro/CAN-ETH
nice descending wedge, looks readyA common misconception that withdrawal fee should be same as a transaction fee for the network. Its just another fee like the trading fee. Its a free market and they can choose whatever fees they want, just like their trading fee is very low compared to other exchanges.

You dont have to use it, but you have the right to complain about it of course =)The more I learned about Binance the more I'd rather use nearly any other exchange. They're extremely greedy.Anybody have a link to this cryptothrowaway post?[**Here's your Reddit Silver, dashby1!**](http://i.imgur.com/x0jw93q.png "Reddit Silver")

I challenge you to source this statement, otherwise, this is just an outright lie.
aww, love how things repeat itself here since years pretty much...

govs ban crypto, people predict the future....

entertaining to say the leastOh gosh, with all these games, I think Ethereum is gonna have to do quite a bit more transactions than VISA.reddit is like 1 week late for everything. So will be for this.
When you see it on 4chan and telegram its hot. And been seeing it there.Trading genius reveals market secrets. ZRX runnning againSomeday in future you wake up and hear that the earth stopped spinning and half of the world population is planning to eat the other half. You shall hear spaceships are selling tickets to March and beyond. Each ticket costs 1 ETH. 

Then you realize how retarded smart you were when you bought 1 ETH for $1k.

Buy ETH while the earth still spins.Because he missed the train when it was less than one cent lol.Ok so what do coins like Electroneum or Veritaseum do and why do they have market caps higher than REQ?It's been up and running for about a week. There's very little volume and it's ugly. People seem to be reading your comment as Coinbase own this dex..they don't. Toshi is a mobile dapp browser and messenger. like we care.Higher than now. I think it will. They kinda have toWASASASASWAAAAUP
You see, you really don't make any sense and you contradict yourself. For once you don't like the Lightning Network and then you proceed to state that the Raiden Network is great. 

I'm more familiar with the Lightning Network than with the Raiden Network simply because the Lightning Network is already working whereas Raiden Network is not.

Also Raiden Network has a useless token that was created just for the sake of having an ICO to profit from the ICO craze, whereas the Lightning Network is actually free and doesn't involve any new tokens, just bitcoins.

Now let me address your previous comment, first Bitcoin is not searching for a savior because it already works as the high fees indicate that there is high demand for doing a Bitcoin transactions because people transacting in Bitcoin knows that once the transaction is included in a block there is no way that transaction will get revoked because Bitcoin is actually trust-less and doesn't rely on a leader that can revoke certain transactions at will.

RSK is a sidechain of Bitcoin that people can use to execute smart contract or to transact between them, so it can also be used for moving some of Bitcoin transaction from Bitcoin blockchain to the RSK blockchain, these type of transaction are off-chain to Bitcoin but are on-chain RSK blockchain.

Lightning Network as stated above is already working so I don't know what you are talking about. As with any new software it comes out as a beta and then after enough testing it will improve, but the key here is that it's already working and brave people are already using it to buy stuff online.Bye.So CAN (ERC20) listed on CMC and its not 200 mil cap as people here FUDDED but less than 40 mil.
And they have a global launch in 2 weeks.top kek

Tesla was also mentioned as part of Dubais vision for a smart city implemented with ethereum

Jan 30th was a date she said.

I was skeptical at first but Im finding more and more evidence linking it all together. Everyone is late on ZRX for now. It can't stay hard all night people.Would love an explanation as wellApparently you do not have to be consistent and can pick and chose.

ETH TAKE ME ENERGY! 

LAMBO ALERT!Wait a second... 921 + 511 + 921 is 2353, if we take out the double numbers thats 25. Its the 26th of January which means the 25th day of the 1st month was yesterday or 1/25, 1 divided by 25 is 0.04 or roughly half the ETH/BTC ratio now. Bet you thought I was going somewhere with that, didnt you.Robinhood is about to drop these kids into Vietnam I swear. Lolreported for wash tradingRaiden actually works, because of fundamental differences in the way Ethereum works versus Bitcoin it actually can ve a decent scaling solution.  But is only a part of the full roadmap, for a good reason.  Off chain scaling has its uses, but onchain still will need to handle massive volume.Ah, gotcha!

It was ZRZ, OMG, ETH, RLC and a few others. January 30th will come and go, but almost surely someone will show up to boast about how it was a joke and so many people took it seriously. Which they always do. Thanks man.  Seems good.  Can't access the coins I have on coincheck yet but they are all still there and seems like I will be able to get them back once they reopen ETH trading.

My wife has a small number of NEM - around 20,000.  coincheck have told her she will be refunded in yen at 85 per NEM.  Not too bad all in all.  Could have been much worse!yes, it does that from time to time.I'm really interested to see how these things work out. I thought it was just a joke when I read the site, but put a little chunk in for fun and now it's gone up 5x already. I mean, it's just a pyramid scheme, but what have I got to lose by putting some more ETH in now? It can only keep getting more popular, right?

And the whole time he wasnt trying to prove how smart he was, he was only trying to help.
Dont really blame him for not hanging out with us.All I have seen over the past months is speculation and FUD.  Never have I encountered any facts. 

The fact this relationship has ended Spurs a lot of speculation and FUD. I do miss transparency, but we just dont know what is going on beneath the hood. 

Wouldnt it be nice if we could verify how much $ is coming in and thus how many tethers are printed? Oh, wait, DAI . 

Yep the kucoin vote was going on during that time. We didn't won but they just updated that they signed an nda with kucoin which most likely means the ceo is paying to get listed which he said he would if we didnt win the voteThis is precious.

It is not locked in, but I was asked to speak on this topic in May.  I plan to speak on ransomware and how it is transitioning from bitcoin to monero, and to bring up ether, but looking for suggestions.

I don't think I can get too technical, but want to being up hardware wallets, exchanges, forex, day trading, mining, and knowing how to buy crypto quickly if a client is ransomed and wants to pay.  Looking for advice on other topics.

I am assuming I will have 15 minutes, but will know more as time goes on.  I used to work for Intel as a tech evangelist so I am comfortable on the presenting part, but I want to do the best for my audience and the overall community.

Thanks!I was surprised to find out recently that not many people in the Ethereum community know about r/TipJarBot/ I want to spread awareness about it, so I am going to send a 0.007 ETH tip to the first 55 people to comment here.

Also, check out a dapp that I spent time thinking about and building that makes it possible for your family to trustlessly get your Ether (and ETH tokens) in case something happens to you.

https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@matthew-analysis/daily-crypto-analysis-28th-jan-technical-analysisHi, a friend of mine is currently traveling in China and needs to send me some money soi can buy a festival ticket on his behalf. Sending through fiat avenues seems excessively cumbersome and expensive, does anyone in here have experience on how he can buyeth with a UnionPay card? Got loads of experiance with western markets but I'm a bit baffled at the prospect of expaining how to buy crypto with chinese fiat to a guy who hasnt even torrented a film before. Would appreicate it if anyone could helpI saw a post earlier that said that Tether is about to collapse and it would bring Btfinex's shutdown. Should I really be worried?
The thing is, that I have not so much alts inside to remove them all at once( thanks to the new minimum withdraw limit) and I will have to do this over a  period of 2 weeks. Should I be concerced?
Thanks in advance!Wow, this has been a surprising coin to hide in the last month. I traded my free BCash for ETH, but I think the BTC/ETH ratio is at full value now. With the amount of inflation ETH has we should dip back to .10 and linger in the .095-.105 range for awhile unless there's some fundamental reason to break higher. Happy trading!Have been reading about tether, and like mostly everyone I agree that they're likely printing tethers out of thing air to buy cryptos - and concerned about possible impact to BTC and ETH as market leaders.

But it's also pretty clear, since you can't redeem tethers for actual dollars, they can't fail by running out of dollars to pay for tether redemptions. 

Moreover, in order to maintain the "appearance" of a peg, all they need to do is buy/sell small amounts of tether (from their larges reserves of crypto bought with printed tethers) on their associated exchanges to create an appearance of a market for tether. Once newer users or other see these small trades, it reinforces the idea that the real value is near $1. 

Like anyone else on these subreddits, I don't like the idea of things being printed out of thin air, but with no redemption mechanism, and the means to easily manipulate the price, I don't see another mechanism for this to cause a crash. 

I can see only the bright future for ethereum but I can see it only when the infrastructure will be there. I try to invest in all of the ICOs that are building it. Would appreciate ICO suggestions with strong tech team and no "give me fast *100 gain"

Thanks in advance!Why, why can't this moment last forevermore?

Suspend belief for a moment with me and step back to the early days of crypto.  Lets pretend your only choices for trading pairs were ETH and BTC.  Cyclical booms and busts have happened for the past 9 years and now ICO-mania is in full swing.  You are constantly being marketed to by high schoolers, bots, and living memes.  Now, battle-hardened and fiscally responsible, you can spot a scam within a few clicks of research. 

You come on to ETH Trader and read about a novel idea for a new coin.  The company wants to peg their coin to major fiat currencies.  They call it RealCoin and, perhaps realizing how fake that makes it sound, changes it to the much sexier *Tether.*  

You go over to [the web site](https://tether.to/) and take a look at the white paper, where you read about novel Proof of _____ systems.  You click on links to see how their reserves are kept and are led to the [Omni website](http://omnichest.info/lookupsp.aspx?sp=31).  Too many links lead to dead pages.  Thats odd.  Maybe your background isnt in computer science, so youll ask about it on reddit. 

Maybe you want to look at a couple of key players on the team: 

- CEO [J.L. van der Velde](https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-l-van-der-velde-26a24b6/) doesnt even list Tether on there. Thats odd, too!
+ CFO [Giancarlo Devasini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giancarlo-devasini-268758154/) (nickname: The Ghost) looks like a bot who isnt even trying.

Are they on social media?  [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tether.to) looks a little outdated.  Thats questionable, but maybe its supposed to be a memorial page.  And why does their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Tether_to/) contrast so much with their company [press](https://tether.to/press/) page?

At this point, I think a few well placed questions to the community are in order:
&gt;Is there something missing?  Is there a better metric that should be used for Tether?

&gt;If there was nothing more than [60 million dollars](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Final-Tether-Consulting-Report-9-15-17_Redacted.pdf) in a redacted persons account earmarked for Tether, how would this affect a market that believes a coin is backed by reserves equaling ~33 times more than that?

Please help me understand if any of my thoughts are off the mark.  I am still learning.  Thanks.

**TL;DR I would pass on this ICO.**

Edit: Formatting. Ten-x app updated this morning...I tried to see if I could order a card and looked at country drop down and voila....U.S. is supported...I pre-ordered my card for $15....wooohoooFirst I'd like to say there is no hard evidence for this theory just a bit of circumstantial evidence that I am shoehorning to fit my narrative.  (Like the 2 other theories out there)

## The Theory: FUD is being pushed everytime the bitfinex funding rate falls

A lot of money is made when the funding rate is high, by users lending and by bitfinex charging 15% fees.  So there is a very clear financial incentive to increase that funding rate.

Below is the funding rate for the last 12 months, I am going to try and link some of the spikes with increased FUD.

https://imgur.com/mDcLIyz

### April

Let's start in April 2017, Bitfinex'ed [joined twitter](https://twitter.com/Bitfinexed) and began to post full time about tether and that it was all a house of cards.  This was paired with constant posts on many reddit subs, medium posts, steemit articles, etc.

This built for about a week or 2 until we saw a panic begin, people ended their funding (can take 2 to 60 days) and started to sell their tether into cryptos, driving those prices up on bitfinex.  It also left the funding market with less liquidity which causes the rates to skyrocket.

### October

There was renewed FUD using the BCH fork and bitfinex's decision to stop supporting individual US customers, it began in august but didn't seem to take hold until october nearly a month after the US announcement.  People only then began to equate the US service restriction to tether with the contasant help of trolls.  This caused bitfinex to issue a clarification around that time.

### Wash trading 

I remember them getting a lot of traction with FUD about wash trading but I can't remember when exactly, the start of December??

### Now

Friedman LLP removed bitfinex from there list of customers, this was noticed about a week ago but as usual it takes time to build a bit of panic and get some traction with FUD.  Expect to see funding rates begin to go up depending on how long they can keep this up.


## Bonus Conspiracy 

This post has been quite pro bitfinex so far, 'it is all FUD bitfinex is fine'.  But what if they are in on the FUD.  MAybe there reluctance to do an audit is so they can continue to undermined tether so they can keep the lending rate high.  15% of all interest is quite an incentive.


## Other Theories

As mentioned at the start their are other theories that have as much proof as this one (namely none), so in the spirit of fairness here they are.

1. Bitfinex/tether is a scam and will eventually collapse leaving USDT and probably any funds on bitfinex worthless.

2. Bitfinex is a start up company that suddenly found itself worth billions and are trying their best to keep the skies on enough to continue to rack in millions a day in fees.  Lack of audits, bad support itc are just growing pains.

If you pick the correct theory and trade accordingly you will likely make a lot of money, good luck.

Thanks for reading.

Roller coasters (since this is crypto) will come...but we are headed to great times.

*Edit: Forgot the most important thing: I wanted to add "With the right fundamentals" (tech + use cases + developers)*Super important but still not sure how to evaluate coins on that. Lets say there is 1000 XY coins available on market, someone buy/sell only 5 coins for 10 USD. That will set the price for XY coin and push the market cap to 10k while you had only 50 USD entry.

How will you evaluate coins with high ratio between market cap and daily volume?

Is there someone experienced with trading stocks? Is such info even important for future price movements?
I'm installing MIST but, if I understood it correctly, it downloads the whole blockhain. I dont have that much disksize.

I have also metamask, but it's an extension. Very limited visually to work on it.

Is there another wallet where I can hold my coins, deploy contracts, but without downloading the whole blockchain?Welcome to the Daily Altcoin Discussion thread of /r/EthTrader.

Vitalik recently tweeted about fee volatility being a huge problem with Ethereum. As a dApp developer that's constantly thinking about fee economics and optimizing dApp interactions around it, it would be amazing if Ethereum fees were cheap and predictable...TEAM token (Ethereum, ERC-20 standard) is a utility token, designed to enable
interaction between fans, celebrities (prospective talents &amp; successful pros),
advertisers, and regular token holders.
TEAM tokens serve as the form of access to the TokenStars platform and its
internal currency. Most of the interactions require usage of TEAMs:
 payment of agency commissions from advertisers and supported talents;
 providing incentives to scouts and fans, who discover prospective talents
and promote celebrities;
 communicating with celebrities and getting access to exclusive offers;
 making betting bids and winning;
 participating in the voting polls;
that will result in higher token turnover along with the course of TokenStars
business growth.I've been working on creating a python 3 crypto currency coin price checker that will display the current prices of the coins that are listed. I currently use it on my raspberry pi with a display attached and have it running under my monitor. It is currently able to grab prices from coinmarketcap, bittrex, poloniex. It uses the public api for those 3 but I will continue to be adding more sources that support public apis along with those that require a key such as binance. This is just a side project for me and its the first time I've every advertised my own projects to people outside of school. I wouldn't mind if you guys contribute to the project or put in some requests using the issues tab on github.

Has anyone gotten a real grasp of it and can share his/her opinion on it?

I heard the company patented it (boo!) but has not put out an ico or similar (yay?).

They seem to have partnerships as well, which I wasnt able to find anything out about.

Would love to hear your thoughts!https://imgur.com/a/yJBLp

Some Precomments:

1. Yes, there is no BTC in my portfolio. All of my Bitcoin needs are taken care of by XMR and XRB. 
2. SPANK has earned its Tier II spot organically. I have not allocated any more funds to SPANK since its ICO.

Not my text, but this is a good one.


1. They already have a working product which is being trialed successfully in Australia, note that this is at an MVP stage with the global launch of a fully functional product soon (March 2018) 

2. The technical team is very strong and they have had good experience developing commercial grade software and apps in the past so they know what they are doing. They also seem to have researched their competitors well. This space will have competition but the aim is to ensure that one is ahead of the pack which I think this team will be able to achieve. I also think that the global P2P marketplace is huge so there should be no issues having 2 or 3 strong players easily being able to coexist here. Plus the fact they have a strong focus in the Asian (China and India and others) market will help since these are booming yet nascent p2p marketplaces ATM. 

3. The team is going in the right direction it seems with respect to ensuring it starts off with a strong, large globally aware community. This includes the acquisition of bountysource as well as the more recent partnership with Earn and hopefully more strong engagements to come. Going forward I would love to see them establishing local CanYa teams in immediate markets they have identified globally so the word gets out there and so that the adoption is quick and persistent. I am quite confident that are at it though. It would be nice to see this happening in parallel with the global product launch.

https://www.kucoin.com/#/trade.pro/CAN-ETHI'm aware if the DNS to a DEX is compromised while signing transactions I am at risk. If the DNS / website is safe at the time of signing a transaction but gets hacked in the future are they still able to get access to my wallet?

I ask because it's the first time I've used a DEX (usually use Binance) and sending the ETH through MetaMask it gave me a warning that signing a transaction is not secure and to ensure I only sign if I absolutely trust the site.Or reaching a milestone on the road map. Would some of you dare to make general exclamations regarding to that?

Do the prices in general then raise? If so, do they mostly drop again shortly afterwards to a certain point? Maybe for some reason even below  the previous price tag? Do you have any comparable examples? Are there good articles to read about?Sure, ERC dEX was listed in Toshi, which is big in its own way, given that there aren't alot of options to browse dApps on mobile at the moment, apart from Metamask (extension for Chrome - desktop) and Brave (desktop version).

But a timetraveller spoke and the real ride may have yet to come...that's what she said: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7e6uiq/daily_general_discussion_november_20_2017/dq48tqq/So I have discovered ETH this year.  Hooray, some money was made. Did some mining, awesome, free money. I also discovered Bittrex and Etherdelta and other exchanges. Also etheroll. And cryptokitties. Among other things. 

I have kept great track of the amount of cash I have put in. And I know what my portfolio was valued most days of the year, and recorded buys and sells to actual real USD.  Which is all I thought I really needed for tax purposes. No I am feeling concerned about not reporting enough. But I can't even make sense of some of my addresses and transfers anymore. 

Anyone else just floored by the amount of activity they need to sort through from this year? Any suggestions if even bitcoin.tax is not helping?  I have a dozen or more eth addresses, handfuls of other wallets for other coins, have used coinbase, gdax, bittrex, etherdelta, binance, kraken. I have played with etheroll and cryptokitties.  

This sucks.. I haven't made enough money to warrant this kind of effort.

This will probably get taken down, living on the edge https://www.ethnews.com/blockchains-llc-acquiring-over-60000-acres-in-nevada-to-showcase-blockchain-applications-yes-ethereum-no-mining?utm_content=buffer73cd3&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=bufferSo, I recently found out about GBTC, which is great if you're a BTC fan. I'm much more bullish on ETH than BTC &amp; I'm looking for a quasi-ETF like GBTC for ETH. Does anyone know of anything out there?Possibly naive question, just trying to understand why the market is reacting so strongly to this news. Any insight would be much appreciated!No one knows the future.  But there is a real possibility that this is the year the Market Cap of Etherium passes Bitcoin.

ETH seems less tied to the ups and downs of BTC as time goes on.  Furthermore, with more exchanges pairing ETH, it will eat away at BTC dominance in that way, as well.  I know I would rather trade in Ethereum pairs than Bitcoin, that is for sure.

In January, BTC has winded down from $13k to around $10k so far, whereas ETH has climbed up from $700 to over $1000 with gusto.  No one knows what is going to happen, but you can feel ETH wanting to swell, while BTC seems rather lame these days.

I know in my own portfolio, I have switched out much of my Bitcoin for Ethereum.  And my guess is this is the year that Ethereum finally surpasses the venerable giant.

So I tried to buy a little ETH earlier. Totally typical thing, I had plans for it to invest in an alt. I purchase roughly 1/3 an ETH around 2pm. Bank account transfer. It goes through, I get the email, and within 15 minutes I had transferred it to my Binance acct, and placed an ETH/AST buy.

So now, about 2 hours later, I get an email saying my coinbase buy failed, because my bank cancelled it. No idea why, since I have relatively lax security settings on that account, and it is not an out of the ordinary transaction. I also received no notice from the bank at all that something might be up.

So.... what happens now?Crypto has a very short attention span.  Everything will be back to normal in 2 days, and all the alts I bought today will be up 20%+, thereby giving me more ETH.  What a beautiful time to be alive.Tether just transferred 200M USDT - probably as a reaction to recent news? Anyway, I think it's the largest transaction I've seen so far:

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz

The [transparency page](https://wallet.tether.to/transparency) states that these tokens are *Authorized but not issued*. However they were already issued before, it seems they've just taken $200M USDT out of circulation.Hey all,

I have had a hard time getting into ICO's lately, they all seem to sell out before my order gets trough. That's why I decided to look for less hyped projects that also have amazing products (in most cases even better than these overhyped ones). I've made a shortlist of 4 projects and I'll include how much I'll be investing in them, and what I expect the profit is going to be in 2018. You may definetly check them out, but always **do your own research before investing!**


 - **The Abyss** -&gt; https://www.theabyss.com/. If you are a gaming fan, like me, you can earn money by playing the games you love + buy games a lot cheaper with this platform. The Abyss is a next generation digital distribution platform, delivering all types of video games ( including AAA-titles, to the fast-growing global game community. Unlike other platforms (Steam, Origin, GOG, etc.), The Abyss offers a groundbreaking motivational and multilevel referral system, allowing gamers to earn from in-game and social activities, and other gamers? payments as well. By joining The Abyss, developers will reduce their marketing expenses and receive an extra income from referral payments made in other games on the platform.

How much will I be investing? I will be investing 1 ETH in this project. I would have put in more but there are several gaming community platforms showing which I will also be a part of. The gaming industry is HUGE, with a revenue of over 100 billion $ annually, and I do not want to miss the boat when a crypto-based platform skyrockets.

My expectation for this project? This project has a very high chance of going x25+. If this platform takes off and becomes the standard for gamers the sky is the limit.

It is also a powerful tool to provide high quality blockchain software components to the large enterprise organizations

How much will I be investing? I will be investing between 5-10 ETH in their presale. Depending on other interesting ICO's that may cross my path before this one launches.

My expectation for this project? If any of these unknown ICO's will go x100+, it will be this one. This platform is revolutionary and will enable software developers to build apps on the blockchain easily. I'm 100% sure the blockchain is here to stay, and the demand for blockchain apps will grow with it. To have a platform where everyone, from beginners to experts, can easily develop apps on, is amazing.


 - **Current** -&gt; https://current.us/. Get paid to play all your media. Current consolidates the best content and features from the most popular media networks into an all-in-one, personalized experience. The best part? Stream your favorite content through the Current Platform and earn tokens while doing so. 

How much will I be investing? I will be investing 1 ETH in their presale. 

My expectation for this project? My expectations for this project are very high (atleast 10x). They already have a fully working platform with over 200k active users, and the project is backed by Mark Cuban. The amount of people watching streams and other content has been increasing exponentially over the past years and will keep on growing, I expect Current to take advantage of this growth, which makes the token grow aswell.


 - **Vitreus** -&gt; https://vitreus.io. Vitreus will track the origin of diamonds and other luxury items via the blockchain. I think this is the perfect usecase for a blockchain,

THE PROBLEM
The problem they will tackle is blood diamonds and insurance fraud. With the help of the blockchain, you can look back at the history of an asset and verify it's provenance

THE SOLUTION
By introducing the blockchain you have a paperless trail and certification for luxury items such as diamonds, or even pieces of art. You can't fake the origin on the blockchain.

How much will I be investing? 2 ETH, I like the project a lot

What are my expectations for this project? Very good. The limited tokens supply @200M means the price can go up. A lot. Plus the softcap is very reachable. This is not one of those icos which expects hundreds of millions of dollars.


These are some, but definetly not all of the ICO's I will be investing in this quarter. I'm always searching for more promising projects to do some research on and I have seen plenty of gems cross these forums. So if you are aware of any upcoming projects that have been flying under the radar, please let me know!What the hell is wrong with people thinking that USDT will crash all the markets? Do you even crypto? This event should be totally the oppositte, right now the price of any coin should be like 2x in USDT with the recent FUD because everybody would rather have their money in any coin instead of USDT, all of you guys crying and selling right now are just making things easier for people to exit USDT...

Imagine the worst case scenario, USDT is proved to be a scam, the price of USDT will go to hell leaving their holders with zero money, but only USDT holders will be affected as nobody would want to trade their crypto for USDT, why would other cryptos have to go down? That's just bullshit...

You should only be afraid of this event if you hold any USDT, if not, you should be totally fine.Based upon my opinion as a lawyer (not giving legal advice), and someone who has overseen corporate compliance audits for major corporations in conjunction with top accounting firms, I just want to point out (like I said awhile ago when the Tether stuff restarted) that the lack of release of the audit reports on Tether were probably due to two factors (and not an empty Tether bank account):

1) **Ongoing audit**. The auditor wouldn't allow a release of the report/preliminary findings because it hadn't finished the audit. They can see the cash in the accounts, but likely wanted to audit way more (e.g., other pairs and also relevant POEs to make sure no other fraud was occuring). This is standard practice, and gets super frustrating--no audit is ever done when you want it to be. This is also why Friedman dumped them--Tether tried to leak a preliminary report that showed the USD in the accounts w/out the audit being completed. Probably also got spooked by the CFTC review and went into auditing overdrive.

2) **Ongoing regulatory investigation**. I thought that Bitfinex was likely under investigation by the CFTC or SEC weeks ago. This explains why they simply couldn't release an audit report or documentation of their accounts. They have to comply with the investigation, and their lawyers are telling them to sit still and don't do anything that could be construed as interference (leaking financial stability information to the public definitely could result in enhanced charges/penalties if the CFTC finds some other compliance issue).

So, IMO, Tether is likely solvent but the CFTC is digging deeper. You can bet if they had an empty Tether bank account, the CFTC would have shut down this shitshow back in December.This is the first time I'm sending some ETH out of MEW. How much gas should I include to send 1 ETH? Don't want to mess up the transaction. 

Thanks! I'd like to propose the addition of either 1) a weekly pinned thread to r/ethereum or r/ethtrader or 2) a new subreddit for the non-technical/non-developers in the community. I suspect there is a growing number of interested people with general business backgrounds (finance, operations, marketing, etc.), like myself, who are intellectually and financially invested in Ethereum. I think it would be great to have a dedicated avenue to discuss, collaborate, and network with peers on ideas for dapps, marketing, etc. This would provide a thought medium for more diverse backgrounds and skillsets than is generally available in r/ethereum. It could help bridge the gap between those who lack development backgrounds with those in the technical community. Merging non-technical folks with the technical folks would propagate sharing of ideas for dapps and decentralized workflows while providing clarity to real world feasibility and technological implications of proposed ideas. Thanks!

***I tried posting this in r/ethereum yesterday, but the bot kicked it for being a discussion that should be included in r/ethtrader. I messaged the mods to advise, but have not received a response.Hello guys, I just want to tell my story, hope you don't mind.

on the 10th of Jan I had 2.14129 on my trading acc on Kraken... and I had open LONG positions on EUR and USD pairs...

when the Korea FUD started I decided to flip my positions and go SHORT down to 10 000$.... I flipped my EUR position, I sold all of my own bitcoin, but before I could flip my USD position the site went DOWN...

WITH NO WARNING !!!! the only announcement was on https://status.kraken.com.... who the feck keeps an eye on that ?? no email... no announcement on the website it self...

so my USD LONG position staid open...

now I think you already know the terribly unprofessional and criminal way the Kraken handled the update... you can see the details here: np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7qcj9u/why_kraken_is_an_unsafebad_exchange_and_why_you/ and here: https://status.kraken.com/incidents/nswthr1lyx72

after 2 days of down time when I managed to log in to my acc the situation was a mess... I was under on both my positions so I decided to minimize the losses/risk and I started closing some of my positions both long and short... I wish I could post my trades but some of my trades are missing from the "history" on Kraken website... the bug trades are not there anymore... (I do have the "screenshots")

anyway first few trades went in normally and my acc had about 1.8BTC left... and than on the 15th of JAN the BUG hit me...!!! instead of losing 200 closing short position I lost 24.82 and 0.53989 BTC at this stage I was left with 1.3 BTC and I was unable to close any of my positions because of the danger the BUG will take it all...

so I contacted Kraken support Ticket #1369001... my ticket was "upgraded" the same day... and Kraken customer support Jochen and Robert contacted me by email... saying pretty much: "yeah... there is a BUG... we are working on it..." and nothing else...

and at the time my only question was: "WHAT DO I DO WITH MY OPEN POSITIONS !!!????"... no replay... I sent numerous emails... no replay... I wasn't even asking when will I get my 0.53989 BTC back... I just wanted to KNOW... WHAT DO I DO with my positions...??? NO REPLAY...

and I didn't get a replay until today... 15 DAYS LATER !!!! Hello Ozzak, Our Team is still working on restoring all balances, we are in the process to document and calculate all affected positions by this. I'll update you shortly, sorry for the delay. The bug is resolved and you can close positions without issues. Best Regards, Jochen Kraken Client Engagement

so NOW he tells me its SAFE to close my position fucking 15 days later. and my acc looks like this at the moment (I already closed some of the positions not to get liquidated) Profit/Loss -6,568.71 (-33.91%) Paper profit/loss of all open positions. Trade Balances Trade Balance 9,839.38 Total margin currency balance. Equity 3,270.67 Trade balance combined with unrealized profit/loss. Used Margin 3,873.09 Total margin amount used in open positions. Free Margin -602.42 Usable margin balance. Equal to equity minus used margin. Margin Level 84.4% Percentage ratio of equity to used margin.

so my Equity is at 3,270.67 or ~0.3 BTC.... because of unprofessional and criminal behavior of Kraken I went from 2.1 BTC to 0.3 BTC... WTF ???

and not only that... but they restored margin trading for other customers like nothing has happened.... they even started charging me rollover fee yesterday... :/

how hes telling me Ill be refunded? For what ?? will it only be the part that BUG took ?? or the whole amount for positions I couldnt close because of you??? when will I be reimbursed ?

I was right about bitcoin crashing and I was meant to make a very nice profit going down and now my whole trading acc is practically gone because the bastards couldnt answer one simple question

so I guess my question now is: now when Kraken finally confirmed that its safe to close the position will I be reimbursed for the losses I take closing this position today? Will I be reimbursed for the positions I already closed...? Will I be reimbursed for the BTC bug took? And when will it happened?

WHERE IS MY MONEY ???

/u/kraken-tyler, /u/jespow, /u/kraken-jpj - do I have to wait for another 15 days to get a replay now...?

ps. oh... and I have all the emails and screenshots if need be...

The following is for Tether tokens on the Ethereum blockchain only.   
The Omni/Bitcoin blockchain Tether tokens function differently.          
Looking through their [smart contract source](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code) on lines 264 through 299 are the blacklist and destroy functions.     
I have excerpted these lines in this [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/LADR4K1V).   
    
**Summary**       
Tether is able to unilaterally blacklist any Ethereum address.    
Doing so labels the user as evilUser and all their Tether tokens are designated as dirtyFunds.     
Once a user is blacklisted the destroyBlackFunds function can be used on their Tether token balances.         
This sets their Tether token balances to 0 and decreases the total supply for the affected Tether tokens.           
             
 **Possible Consequences**      
Aside from the obvious of being at the complete mercy of Tether, this leaves them open to potentially catastrophic incidents and coercion from governments and other entities.       
Someone who gains access to the smart contract functions could blacklist all token holder addresses and then destroy all Ethereum Tether tokens.    
Tether could say they will comply with all legitimate government orders and blacklist and destroy the funds of anyone a government requests.      
   
**As a potential model for authoritarian governments**   
Cash is difficult to control.     
How much easier it would be for a government to have centralized control over all of their citizens' net worth of legal currency.     
First a warning is given.       
After so many offenses or for whatever reason, the citizen's government issued address is blacklisted, temporarily or permanently.   
Their funds destroyed, or not.            
This would cut them off from rest of the national economy, except for those who'd risk becoming blacklisted as well.  
This has all the makings of a Black Mirror episode.             
   
**Plea**  
Please, don't support this model.    
Don't let think anyone think this is acceptable.   The possible start of a Bitcoin bear market and how Ethereum may react to that. Bitcoin cash remaining within a small consolidation along with Cardano within its longer term consolidation. And a look at Neo and what its up to.

https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@matthew-analysis/daily-crypto-analysis-30th-jan-technical-analysisIt's common knowledge that the safest place to store cash is in an FDIC-insured savings account.  Knowing that - and assuming secure 2FA is being used - how is it so much riskier to store funds in an FDIC-insured Coinbase account?

Using only a hardware wallet could even be more unsafe because then there is no safety net.  There are far more, "I lost all my ETH because I made a stupid mistake" posts involving losing or overwriting private keys than there are, "I lost all my ETH because [insert hypothetical scenario involving bankruptcy or a rogue employee]" posts.

Do you keep all of your cash under your mattress as well?  How can you trust a bank with your hard-earned money?

Maybe I am missing something.The guts of it will hit by March 15 (meaning true flirtation, hovering around 75% of Btcs market cap). Expect full flip by April 1. It will take about a week or two for the average investor to fully grasp the ramifications, after which Eth will go on a massive bull run. By the end of the summer, I expect Eths market cap to be around $250b and Btc to sit around $100-150b. Set your reminders. I have contacted Coinbase support many times and have gotten no real answer. My identity has been confirmed. I have been using it for years. I have tried other exchange sites but they don't support my location (Washington State). Has anyone had a similar experience?Anyone out there holding ICN, and their thoughts. 

I find that there isnt a proper forum to discuss this Ethereum based token. 

Every time something like this happens, there's less chance it happens again (as the market, theoretically, will mature). Couple that with all the good news to come; adoption, scaling solutions, POS, and you have a recipe for success. 



As more and more people see crypto survive the storms, and it become more and more a part of their daily lives (as opposed to the odd Bloomberg article and internet banner ad) they *will* feel more comfortable investing, and the prise will rise.



How much will ETH be worth in 12 months? I don't know, and I don't think anyone does. What I do know is this: there's a very good chance that the future is **very** bright for ETH/Ethereum, and if you're interested in investing in the cryptosphere, you could do a lot worse than to park your $ here.



As always, only invest what you can lose, crypto *is* risky - but you take on that risk because you want 5x-10x+ returns. Have fun out there. If there is a better sub to have this discussion, please direct me to it 

Basically, I use MetaMask to buy and sell minor coins with Ethereum as my buffer. Just buy ethereum via Coinbase, send it to my MetaMask, and buy smaller coins through MetaMask. However, today MetaMask updated, and I was able to use my secret code words to link my account back up to it, but none of my coins are there. It still shows me as having some ETH left over that I used for gas, but my transaction history and ~$150 worth of minor cryptos are gone. Is there anything I can do to solve this problem?It seems coinbase doesn't accept my Skrill card, or the other way around.

Are there any exchangers I can use to buy ETH using Skrill?Our indie game studio RareSloth will be using Ethereum for our next game; King Rabbit - Furever. We believe in the Ethereum technology and think it will open up new opportunities that improve the customer experience. If you're interested in the details you can visit [our website](http://www.raresloth.com). 

We're excited to be on the cutting edge of this technology, we can't wait to see how things pan out. Feel free to ask questions!https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/crypto-exchange-bitfinex-tether-said-to-get-subpoenaed-by-cftc

Based on the technology changes coming, the timing of taxes, and the general previous behavior of bull-runs, I think we'll see the next bull run in early May or June, to price levels of $4,000 or greater.

We just had an awesome bull-run and now we're in a bit of a cool-down period. Taxes are being figured out, and technology is being improved. Price-wise I think the result is that we're in a necessary slowdown period, and it will stay that way for another 3-5 months.

Once the technology improvements are realized, adoption increases, and people feel more comfortable to start making speculative investment spending we'll see a new bull run. I don't think it will be as aggressive as a 10x on pricing that we see from spring of 2017, but I'm betting a 4-7x is likely.

This is all pure speculation based on how I view the state of the Ethereum universe right now.Starting off by saying nothing but love for the MEW team; I just wanted to have a thought exercise. 

Is it possible for them or a malware program to:

Transfer eth to a different address than the one that is displayed on your ledger when confirming? 

Transfer a different amount of eth than the amount displayed on the ledger? 

Change the text of your signed transactions after you sign, altering the amount or address? 

I think everyone already knows that very soon the start of the project will be launched and I'm sure that it will end in an instant. Who believes in him and is ready to invest all his virtual savings, and who else has doubts, and he uses only a small part? Personally, I still have some doubts, but I will still take part in it. The future is not known to us, and white paper is written very beautifully!What we have works. We have a secure system that becomes more and more expensive every day to try to hack. We also have a hardware community which is dumping capital into supporting this blockchain which has the ability to disrupt (and improve!) trillions of dollars of commerce globally. That is huge.

We also have a very real problem. And that problem is scaling. We have ~75B of ICOs which will bring their apps online this year. Those apps are being written by incredibly talented teams who are going to bring wonderful products to market. And those apps are going to be very demanding on the Ethereum network.

In order for Ethereum to succeed, the focus right NOW needs to be scaling. Yes, PoS can have scaling, but so can PoW. And PoW currently WORKS.

If we do not get scaling in place this year, Ethereum will fail. And if Ethereum fails, it is very possible that confidence in crypto-currency in general falters.

My opinion is not popular. Every 3 posts I see on this subreddit are people asking for PoS. I find that to be wildly irresponsible. PoS is going to be very difficult to implement. It will take time. And during that time, if the Ethereum network is inoperable (remember cryptokitties?), developers will move elsewhere. Capital will move elsewhere. And Ethereum will die.

PoW uses energy. A lot of it. Yes. We are all acutely aware. But guess what? It is working. And maybe this is just the way it is going to be for the first 5 years or so. AND THAT IS FINE.

Why? Because I am looking at the bigger picture. I want Ethereum to be successful. I want to remove all the middlemen out there who are charging us insulting rates (I'm looking at you, Ticketmaster). I want for disruption to take place. I want to remove power from the banks and the lobbyists. And that CAN HAPPEN.

But it will not happen if we focus on and demand PoS today. WE NEED SCALING TODAY.

Yes. I fully understand that PoS is expected to have scaling. But how long will that take to put into place? Are we willing to jeopardize this global movement because people want to save energy and for their Ethereum to moon due to staking?

Ethereum will moon with adoption. Ethereum will moon with scaling. Global interest will moon if Ethereum is successful.

And then we can focus on PoS. After we have proven to the world that crypto-currencies do have a place and does bring value to the global commerce system. That is the time to focus on improving the system and reducing electricity consumption. I think that is a wonderful long term goal. But it is the wrong short term goal. The short term goal is making Ethereum successful. And that requires scaling. Which can be done today on the PoW system. Which works.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

TL/DR: We need scaling. PoS development will take too long to implement with scaling. The focus needs to be scaling on the PoW network.

Mandatory Disclaimer. I am a GPU miner. I have invested in supporting the hardware network of this ecosystem. I am being compensated by the system for doing that. I also own Ethereum and fully believe it's value will increase with adoption and use of the currency.[Snake flip](https://www.ethwork.net/snake.html), called so because the experiment consists of a string of tokens that gets longer, is a social experiment in a smart contract where all but the last participants gain (real) ETH as long as Ethereum exists. How is this possible? This is how it works ([read smart contract here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x01dd8186b8f38dfa01ea2c044355ea95206a4481)):


First there is only one token, the snake head. This token can be bought for .01 ETH using Metamask. Every time someone buys a token, the price of that token increases 50% (making it 150% of the previous price). The next buyer can thus buy the head token for .015 ETH. The original buyer will receive his original investment + 25% gain:  .0125 ETH (and yes, I get the remnant). 


Every time the head-token is traded, a new token is added to the tail, increasing the length of the snake. The initial owner of this new token is the last buyer of the head-token. The tail tokens are a safer investment because they should be cheaper to trade than the head token and have more promise to sell again until they reach the price of the head-token. You can own multiple tokens at the same time, all of which will earn you 25% profit when sold.


At first, investments and gains are small, but as the tokens get traded they increase in price. If a token is worth 1 ETH and you buy it, you will gain 1.25 ETH if it is sold. If a token is worth 50 ETH and you buy it , you will gain 62.5 ETH if it is sold. 


Of course there is a risk, namely that your token never gets sold. But since the smart contract does not have a selfdestruct (nor a withdraw) function, it will exist as long as Ethereum exists, so youll have forever to sell your token; and your gain will always be 125% of your investment.


[Try it here!](https://www.ethwork.net/snake.html) Early participants have a near 100% chance of profit! 


Q: Isnt this a Ponzi scheme? 
Kind of, however traditional Ponzi schemes have an element of deceit in them, whereas this experiment does not.


Q: Is this an ICO?
No, just a 30 minutes smart contract.


PS. to see if a token you own sold, check the etherscan page for your metamask account. the internal transactions tab. ETH transactions sent from a smart contract to you do not show up in your Metamask history afaik.
It's a 2013 Model S 85. Gray exterior, beige interior. 45,000 miles. It has the tech package, free supercharging, and brand new tires.

I'm in the US. If you're close enough we can meet somewhere, if not I can ship it.

The dealer offered me $40k. I'm thinking I should take no less than 40 ETH, maybe more seeing how there's potential for a price drop and I'll need the fiat equivalent sooner rather than later so hodling might not be possible.

What do you all think? What's a fair price in ETH for a vehicle with a trade-in value of $40k?

Let me know if you're interested and we can work out the details.Our community has been going through ICO pitches, and weve identified a handful of opportunities to get your SOMO going. (Satisfaction Of Missing Out)

Personally, I believe the flippening will eventually happen. But people here are being to pessimistic towards bitcoin, and I'm not saying they should appreciate it because it is a good currency, I don't believe that myself. I'm saying bitcoin is prime brand recognition. 2018 will be the biggest year for crypto yet, the year the masses flood in. The year crypto becomes mainstream. And if you want to play it safe with your investments, what do you do? Of course you buy BTC because you don't even know of anything else. This is going to be a very good year for ETH, but it is also going to be a good year for BTC, and I would not expect the flippening to happen this year at all. Maybe 19? Maybe 20? It's inevitable, but not this soon.So we know Goldman Sachs is planning a cryptocurrency trading desk: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-21/goldman-is-said-to-be-building-a-cryptocurrency-trading-desk

Now something interesting I've also noticed, is that The Ocean X, powered by 0x, has an interesting team: https://theoceanx.com/team/

If you look at the 3rd person, John Piotrowski, and check his LinkedIn page, you'll notice he is currently Vice President at Goldman Sachs, Finance Division, Capital Analysis: https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnpiotrowskiuva/

It also shows him doing "Business Development" for The Ocean X for the past couple of months. Yeah sure, going from Vice President at Goldman Sachs to Biz Dev guy for some startup while maintaining current status for both positions sounds like a totally natural career move. /s

The Bloomberg article says Goldman is "assembling a team in New York". The Ocean X now looking for a "Community Director" in New York, NY? - https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/community-director-for-blockchain-startup-at-the-ocean-x-580841512/

I wonder who else in the 0x ecosystem has ties to Goldman Sachs? Oh right, the co-founder of Coinbase, Fred Ehrsam, who now advises for 0x, was previously with Goldman Sachs: https://0xproject.com/about

We know Goldman Sachs owns the SETLCoin patent, maybe they want to use 0x to connect SETL to other assets? - https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-07-17/goldman-wins-patent-setlcoin-technology

Another thing, on TheOceanX.com homepage, they say "Our mission is to build the worlds largest, deepest, and best supported token liquidity pool." Key words being "liquidity pool". Goldman Sachs' liquidity pools are called "Sigma X". - http://www.goldmansachs.com/what-we-do/securities/gset/equities/liquidity-access/ Any coincidence The 0cean recently rebranded to The Ocean X? - https://medium.com/@theoceanx/we-changed-our-name-slightly-4cd72bf4d386

Funny sidenote, their Sigma X platform executes orders using an NBBO they nick-named "Ocean".Dont be like me. Dont fall for the hype of making a quick dollar off these coins and their promises of "mooonnn" bullshit. Ethereum is the truth and the future. I sold a shit of my ETH and dabbled into this hype only to get burned on pump and dumps everywhere. Man, fuck it, I'm rebuying at a loss and never selling out again. Im sorry ETH, please take me back.  Could be time-sensitive stuff, as well. Not just long-term things. I'm more inclined to work on short-term stuff.

I'm a Stanford student trying to build things that are actually useful or cool to crypto enthusiasts, as a way to ethically make some personal capital short-term (no I don't want to do a fucking ICO).

My experience/skills are in building products -- mobile apps, websites, other coding, etc.

Ethereum dapps look really cool, and pretty easy to setup. I was really inspired looking through the source code of CryptoKitties -- kinda stupid but genius at the same time.

Anyone have ideas for either useful or fun smart contract ideas?A lot already believe this will be the year of eth. Scaling is the biggest concern.
