EDIT: this is just one of many listings.  They are hiring a ton of people to build this thing.  It's all centered on Ethereum.Hey Chaps, I wanted to invest in Symmetry ICO but found this nice summary of red flags so I thought it might help some of you. IMHO they are scam... 

-----------------------

[Source: Wolf Crypto News Telegram]

**Symmetry Fund - ICO Redflags**

If you are thinking about investing in Symmetry Fund ICO I would advise increased caution. Website and Whitepaper look very professional but digging deeper into the project, a number of red flags appear:


**1.** All LinkedIn team member profiles seem to be rather new, no recommendations present
  -&gt; they also seem not to exist outside LinkedIn / Symmetry fund website

**2:** There is no direct link between the Symmetry fund website and a real person:
-&gt; someone contacted the consulting lawyer who advised them, but he claims to never meet at any of the individuals behind the fund or saw any papers
-&gt; website of symmetry itself is registered through a hosting/DNS lookup protecting   
   construction (Domains by proxy), so is fully anonymous
https://www.whois.com/whois/symmetry.fund

**3:** all their advisors have been changed (previously members of the COSS team were mentioned, but they deny any link to it)
https://medium.com/@irfanmuhammadsyamsularief/investment-with-the-symmetry-fund-f5abafde425

**4.** Their advisor Mike Henkel also does not seem to exist, he also does not work for POLARIS Investment as claimed on the Symmetry Fund website

**5:** The advisor named Leah Kronshage was removed from the English site. When asked about it on Telegram, the admin Andrew stated: "he is an impersonator". Weird though, if you switch the language of their site to Korean, Leah is still there...

**6:** They promised to meet interested investors at the Dubai International Blockchain Summit, except no one showed up

There are better and safer investment opportunities out there. Always do your own research before investing in an ICO.

Recently i sold some of my stack in order to be able to buy the dip. I stored the FIAT on my GDAX account. Now i just check my account and see all the FIAT is gone and i suddenly have a large amount of LTC (i never bought LTC before).  I immediately sold all the LTC and transferred the money to my bankaccount. Now i see all this weird orders in my account for small amounts of LTC. I never received a message or email that someone logged in. (I use  2FA for both login and sending of funds). Please help.Blocktix has released their web app and is scheduled to release their mobile applications this week. This will be the leading complete blockchain (smart contract) based ticketing system. From their affiliations with big players in the industry, I can see Blocktix as one of the first mainstream uses of Blockchain technology that will be huge publicity for the benefits of blockchain and Ethereum. Hey guys, I already have a diversified portfolio and I reserved 1 last ETH to invest in some shill coin from Reddit. I was thinking going HAT Hawala, but they are promising fiat-crypto and I'm not sure they can delivery. So, I have 1 ETH waiting to go to some small cap coin or token but I'm out of leads.

Would you mind shilling me a coin? Low cap please, I want moon.

BTW, market will keep droping, HODL and believe, 500 billion market cap is nothing, we are just getting started.As you know Russia plan to ccept the law and legalize crypto, exchanges and exchangers. My friend has 3 domains: 1. ethereumstore.ru 2. etherstore.ru 3. ethstore.ru. How do you think an he get some money for sell them now? or maybe wait few years?I'm planning to send some ETH to get into an ICO. I expect it'll be over within minutes and I plan to complete ETH tx within a minute or two maximum. Say I wanna send 0.2 ETH via MEW - how much would you recommend for gas limit. It is automatically set at 21000. This seems a bit too high. What is the price of 1 gas? Interesting development...

https://www.rgj.com/story/money/business/2018/01/23/industrial-park-houses-tesla-gigafactory-nearly-sold-out-after-blockchains-deal/1059002001/

" Blockchains LLC, is purchasing 64,000 acres at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, with the deal expected to fully close by the first week of February, said Lance Gilman, principal and director of the industrial park.

The industrial park that plays host to Tesla, Google and Switch in the Reno area is almost sold out as a blockchain software company is finalizing plans to buy more than half of its land.

The company specializes in financial services, security, software and apps using blockchain technology  a secure digital ledger or record that is typically associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Blockchains LLC specifically deals with the Ethereum blockchain, which anchors the second-biggest cryptocurrency in the world. The Ethereum cryptocurrency is only trumped by Bitcoin in terms of market cap." 

" Blockchains will use 150 of the acres it purchased at the industrial center to build a campus park that will house the companys headquarters, Gilman said. What the company will do with the rest of the land remains to be seen.

I believe theyre going to showcase to the world everything that the blockchain technology is capable of, Gilman said. Now will they do all the work themselves or work with other developers to house other users? Only time will tell.

This might not necessarily warrant its own thread but I just wanted everyone to be aware that Coinbase (or possibly the card company) changed their merchant category code so that all credit card purchases are now treated as a cash advance. I have not confirmed this myself (only used a CC my first couple of purchases), but the reports are widespread. The change happened within the last 48 hours.

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: Thanks to /u/TrickyxWolfx for this response he received when inquiring with Chase to have the cash advance fee refunded:

&amp;nbsp;


"Hello XXX XXXX,

I am happy to assist you with the cash advance fee wavier request.

XXXX, the transaction to Coinbase dated January 20, 2018 is listed as a quasi cash transaction. It is categorized as "POI Funding Transactions(Excluding MoneySend)".

Let me share that Visa and MasterCard systems assign a category code to each merchant, based on the kinds of products and services they sell. Sometimes the system places merchants in a generalized category, like "superstores" instead of "grocery stores" or "gas stations."

I refunded your account for the two ash advance fees of $10.00 each. You'll see this adjustment on your February 9, 2018 statement.

A quasi cash transaction is one that is similar to a cash advance. Money transfers, money order purchases, gambling transactions, and other transactions where cash is accessed will be classified as quasi cash transactions. Quasi cash transactions are subject to a 5% transaction fee with a $10.00 minimum and no maximum. Also, they earn interest on a daily basis and accrue interest from the date they post to your account until paid in full.

The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for cash on your account is a variable rate of 26.24%, which is the minimum rate for cash.

We appreciate your business and thank you for being a Chase customer.

Thank you, xxxx xxxxxx"I'm creating a spreadsheet so I can keep track of everything and try to be as safe as I can be. But say you got audited even though you were being honest with your taxes, what are some things to prove to them? What are some things I should put on my spreadsheet besides my buy/sell order history? On Coinbase and GDAX when I download my CSV sometimes I see Transfer ID, Coinbase ID, Trade ID, etc, which ones am I suppose to look for and keep a record of?

According to EOS wiki [1]: 
"We expect that C++ will be the best language for developing high-performance and secure smart contracts."

Developing smart contracts has some pitfalls and can lead to vulnerabilities; we have observed them also in Ethereum's world when using solidity. However, from a technological point of view C++ is much much more difficult and therefore worse.  

As an investor you should really think about if EOS is a big deal in the long term (in case you believe in technology fundamentals)... 

[1] https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/wiki/Smart-ContractEarly bird tickets are nearly gone. Save $100 while supplies last! 

Attendees will learn everything they need to know to get started in the world of cryptocurrency as we highlight the tools and resources available to you.

All-star keynote speaker lineup to be announced soon. After party included with ticket (limited spacing).

Get your tickets: https://events.bizzabo.com/dayforcryptoit's not a huge amount but still : i've bought around 150euros worth of Eth on coinbase, and it went just a lil up from what i've bought despite the crashes. I won't bore you with the cents etc, but my account dropped from about 150 to 130euros and i have more ETH than when i've started to "invest"... Anybody has an explanation/same problem? (and i've thought about the variation of the euro itself, still doesn't make sense, it's like 20euros have gone poof)Rookie to crypto here, have some portfolio tools but all seem to present portfolio in FIAT instead of ether/btc primarily. I.e. Delta says my portfolio is x, up y while actually my portfolio in ether is down with z. So, not helpful if you're looking to grow in ether.

Any tools, tips or pointers to a portfolio site, app or something that I can use?This downed on me while reading a whitepaper *(apologies if it has been pointed out before)*:  

**Traditional enterprise**:  good ideas are locked in enterprise 'secret-sauce' vaults - the inner workings, business model of an enterprise was highly guarded (still is, and for good reason in some cases).  

**Blockchain/crypto business models**: it is all out there in whitepapers and github.  

You gotta love that!Everyone says that "if only i had spent more on X coin when it was X price!" but they forget that a lot of them would have sold early. 

so those of you who have held Eth from last January or before, how did you resist selling when it went to 20 dollars but crashed back down to 10? or how did you resist selling at 300 dollars? I'm interested in the resolve it took to hold.

What was the process? I'm in a similar position right now with another coin which i think is going to have an ETH kind of run, but you never really can tell for sure. 
zrx is the tokenI sold mine for more NEBL like 2 days ago. Fuck meI always hear these two recommended. WhyWell that's just great. I had a sell order at 0.0018.  As soon as I sell it's mooning. Just fucking great. Hallelujah!What?ZRX- Da sleeper.  Hide yo kids, hide yo wifeeeeSources?More cryptocurreny was lost during the Mt Gox hack. You lucked out with Coinbase.  They're probably the fastest, but not usually that fast. Kraken isn't known for their speed, but they're better than polo.  I had tickets open with them for over 50 days not once but twice.I don't have enough experience in C++ to comment, but I will anyway. High level languages are not necessarily safer just because they are (seemingly) easier. It might be easier to get started, but it's also easy to make a mess. I'm not saying C++ is devoid of pitfalls, but perhaps things like type checking would be advantageous.I'm sitting in a cubicle trying to get work done. It's Friday bruh I'm not staying one sec over.Well Ill be damned... 0x gdax... Tesla... This is definitely the best daily thread for crypto Hi, what is your ticket number? I can assure you there is a reason for the delay.The cryptocurrency is that you don't need trust. Did he miss the memo?This is my favorite timeline. Hope this happens in the next 3 months.Actually can't cause some weird shit with the space

"Look at their hands. They seem unnatural in the photos" lolFOMO'd yesterday. Very low cap. Won award from walmart. Big Partnerships already in place. depends on how detailed and accurate the specs are. Development is actually really fast when you know exactly what you have to do. Compare the looks of both charts and tell me
We only benefit when BTC goes side ways Well, I guess we're going in either of two directions once this channel closes in:

Hopefully we blow through 1106 with some volume.It's been a good two weeks and none of us have seen any of our money. Kraken has been emailing us telling us to keep waiting and that they are working on it but no action has been taken and it's starting to hurt my bottom line. I rely on trading for a living and taking my trading capital is essentially taking away my income. 

Worse yet I got a newsletter email last night that they re-enabled margin trading on their platform and have yet to clean up their mess. Seems unprofessional and risky at best.

Please take care of your clients in a timely manner.

pinging /u/dont_forget_canada /u/Kraken-Tyler /u/kraken-jpjHave any of the recent bull runs been the direct result of positive news? The EEA certainly drove the March-June run. But since then I am not sure that's been the case. It may be a fools errand to try and time these movements with expectations about DAPPs going live, ETH futures announcements, protocol upgrades, etc. CONGRATS YOU DONT BELIEVE IN GOD.  YOU DONT NEED TO BE A VEGAN ABOUT IT.  I can't say for certain but I've been seeing ZRX a lot more in the news, and the biggest dollar value (at the time) crypto hack ever wouldn't surprise me as a key catalyst. Damn, rip to whoever fat-fingeredOmg, my eyes Blockfolio.  Some dodgy ED trade.I don't believe it does confirm it. bitcoin's mempool is full, so there was a hard limit to the number of transactions, that chart only really demonstrates that more people want to use bitcoin than can fit on the chain, and that Ethereum isn't yet being held back by that to the same extent. The scaling is very important, and I prefer ETH, but I don't think the 10X increase follows as a correlation with scaling. As Bitcoin's graph shows (so far) it is possible for price to not be correlated with T#.Throwaway was a shill,but go ZRX!30th January 2018, Coinbase, Nasdaq, Dubai, Google, Tesla, ZRX ETH RLC OMG, JesusChrist, he is a sheits finally deserving recognition it deservesIn other words, Eth is still tied at the hip with BTC fluctuations?its a great holdZRX finally seeing its day! strong hold! ThrowAWAY was right!Could be. Hope it's not a targeted p&amp;d.It was on cnbc as the next big coin I just got a notice on my Toshi app (developed by Coinbase) that they are making a dex that is utilizing 0x.

Smells like Moon Spirit.25%This is definitely one of the most undervalued projects in the space. Once they get the fiat gateway live it will be a great way to get passive investors in the space and bring tons of fiat into the space.Following, because almost FOMOing on TRAC new ezpz account ?you can reddit but can't look up news at work? if we reach 0.5 with BTC then BTC would simply die, our marketcap would be triple that of BTC, and our Technology is already 100 times better, media will only focus on the winner and discuss how outdated BTC isguys what's happening with 0x? wooI'm hoping that the early adopters/big holders who care about crypto have cashed out enough to leave lots of USD/USDT with limit buys across the big exchanges to support any significant dips, more than anyone trying to cause a panic. But who knows.

The crazy thing about so many believing that there will be a selloff whenever someone says contracts close is it's a self fulfilling prophecy... dump and pump.Lol where??I still think you're attributing this based on the wrong chart, it's BTC that's falling and bots are just making sure we don't take over. A bot keep setting a 90 BTC sell wall thats driving the price down slowly, but once any buy momentum picks up, the wall disappears, nevertheless the idiots keep selling under itCan anyone anti-shill me on TRAC? I feel like the project is very promising and the team is capable and communicative. With that being said, I always like hearing different viewpoints so that I (and whoever reads this) am better informed.Can anyone explain why ZRX is moving up? Any news? I'm at work.You don't just go adjusting the USD value, that's not how valuations and taxes and financial reports work. It doesn't matter what the company lost x years from the day it was lost, its measured at the time of loss. 

If we take into consideration BTC's value today, MtGox was much bigger, but then now we have a picture that doesn't give us relative information about the scale of damagewell well https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7t2q2c/daily_general_discussion_january_26_2018/dt9jvvo/ (:Lawd have mercy there's a fire     If MathSkill &lt; 0

       print "moon"

    else 
       print "HODL"I appreciate the feedback. I've been watching FUN as well. Here's a better question. Distributed networks require others to get involved and support the community and tech. How does someone get involved helping build their tech. Is any of it open source? Do they just want people to shill for them?ETH people dont use elevators. We either teleport or drive our lambosCorrect. The test net might come out later this year but I doubt it will be implemented this year.ZRX is very resilient Yay bloom worth 11.8 btc each.   Rich AFokay so i added charts http://spicyblock.com but i need some traffic so the dyno doesnt go to sleep and it can generate some data pointsThat DAO situation was very different, and a fork to recover funds was much easier because of the nature of the DAO (lock up of Eth etc). This is just a bunch of random tokens on an exchange. I don't even think a fork to make everyone whole again is feasible in a situation like this. Perhaps partners is the wrong term to use for my EEA anology since it's an agreement on paper that doesn't necessarily mean they trade services. I said Ripple could only divulge one client using XRP, Cuallix which we agree on. Using being the key term here.

And to specify, I was trying to sum up the clip for the parent-comment who asked for context so don't hold me accountable for these facts you claim I got wrong, contact Bloomberg. I did however edit my initial comment to top 7 global banks as well as clarify RippleNet in relation to the Swedish anecdote.

FYI (since I'm sensing some territorial hostility in your tone): I want Ripple to succeed, more Blockchain for everyone. But at its current state, I'm dubious on XRP's role in it. Skepticism is good in this space, right? ;-)Don't remember. Could be him. Did that to me with VIU. I had over a billion dollars for a few hoursHas their fees gone down at all? When I initially started poking around their fees seemed to be a bit high, but I think the devs mentioned they would decrease once volume picked up.This is a chicken/egg situation.  A 30% increase in price will send that algo in reverse real quick. Adjusted USD value is much more during the Mt Gox hack. But not the fees plus the taxes, if youre an American. I'm saving the best one for the flippening&gt; And I think a weakening dollar is part of that.

Obviously. For a european like me, the value of your house barely changed.Yeah, I don't know about crumbling.  Buy side looks pretty thick to me.  40k Buys at $800.  28k at $900.  Yall are so dramaticAnd that kid was Albert Einstein?Centralized exchanges are so 2017&gt;  like it does on average every 8-12 years

I always thought the average was 7 yearsWhoops, edited!Yes. Similar thing for CRED on ED. This market is so brand new...
We can really only speculate, it's kinda exciting but if we look at LTC, it's still up like 3x from before the spike. 
I mean, that's the only thing I could speculate off of. aha I'm not sure you understood what chainlink is for :)Go ZRX go!Crumbling = down like $12 over the last several hours &gt; Porn sells.

Completely agree. However, theyre going to be competing against BAT to win over publishers + users. More competition in the space is always good, so Im excited to see them both in action!XRP is a trash token, theres your tldrIf you just need your keys out, click your account, and then export.  I think your get a UTC.......JSON file.   

Use MEW to access it.  Adding BAT and OMG would be divine - I'm thinking they have to be front runners. I wonder how long the pump would last...ZRX going crazy right now :O  Seems like people don't even have orders above 18k sats to sell...Sweet man. I gained back the fees I was charged. Hahahaha! I'm sorry you're *convicted*... IMO don't worry about it, Coca Cola and Nestle will take care of the water problem, no problem amigo!So se are veeery far away still It seems... ATH was only 13 days ago?!?  Feels like a crypto lifetime.ETH crumbling under whale pressure with no support. Brace for some more of that sub-1000 ETH.I always feel I am too early for stuff, I bought WTC from like 3-8$ then sold. Then forgott the real big volume pumps...

https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@matthew-analysis/daily-crypto-analysis-26th-jan-technical-analysisPlease take this with a grain of salt, there are no facts on anything that I'll be presenting, and this post is full of speculation and assumption.

By now you may have heard that Vince McMahon is planning on bringing back the XFL following the 2019-2020 NFL regular season, and you're probably thinking, "Why in the world would he do that?"  The former Xtreme Football League only lasted one season and was a horrible attempt at competing against the NFL, however, I think a new league can hold merit.

Several FAQs from the current XFL.com website:
*An opportunity exists to reimagine Americas favorite sport by putting fans at the center while leveraging a changing media landscape and evolving consumer viewing behavior.
*The new XFL is a single entity structure with plans for eight teams at launch, all of which will be owned by the league.
*The players' salary structure is still in development, but players will be paid to play and paid more to win.

Additionally, Vince McMahon aims to "re-imagine" football, and despite the former failed XFL venture, he is a proven businessman with a strong ability to make money.

Still, it sounds crazy and many are assuming it will fail again.  I like to try to see both sides, and Vince McMahon is a person who likes to be on the forefront new and radical ideas.  He took the Olympic sport of wrestling and transformed it into an entertaining global spectacle, and managed to raise his net worth to an excess of $1 Billion.  I'm not going to be so quick to dismiss his ideas and track record.

Now, why I think he can pull this off:
'Fans' are not going to exist early on, because there is no history or fandom to be had, thus we'll need to add incentive.  As a potential consumer, what would generate my interest?  Incentive and a lot of it.
*Give spectators the opportunity to control the game, so they have built in stake, similar to this idea (https://fcfl.io/thank-you.php?__s=uq1p6p2xkhgsthtbhpwp).  By tuning into the game, I can vote on which plays I want to be called, but let's take it even a step further.  
*Discounts - in stadium discounts for attending, correctly choosing plays, etc.
*Player endorsement incentives - We remember Rod "He Hate Me" Smart, but what if we had Tom "Amazon" Brady.  Give players the right to sell the name on their back to highest bid
*Fractional Team Ownership - The XFL can sell off fractions of each team and you can become the GM.  Fandom and viewership doesn't have to stop on Sundays.  You can now help negotiate the day-to-days through consensus ownership
*True fan loyalty - We all know someone that flip flops their fandom, but what if you were rewarded for staking your fandom based on length of time?
*Other things to be voted on: rules/regulations, team names and future locations, jersey colors and logos, etc.

Just a few small ideas, but the more I think about it, the more I think it can make sense.  Would love to hear everyone's thoughts
Seems like Joseph Lubin lied on national TV about incoming Ethereum futures. He said any day now and it's been months.

-----------------------

[Source: Wolf Crypto News Telegram]

**Symmetry Fund - ICO Redflags**

If you are thinking about investing in Symmetry Fund ICO I would advise increased caution. Website and Whitepaper look very professional but digging deeper into the project, a number of red flags appear:


**1.** All LinkedIn team member profiles seem to be rather new, no recommendations present
  -&gt; they also seem not to exist outside LinkedIn / Symmetry fund website

**2:** There is no direct link between the Symmetry fund website and a real person:
-&gt; someone contacted the consulting lawyer who advised them, but he claims to never meet at any of the individuals behind the fund or saw any papers
-&gt; website of symmetry itself is registered through a hosting/DNS lookup protecting   
   construction (Domains by proxy), so is fully anonymous
https://www.whois.com/whois/symmetry.fund

**3:** all their advisors have been changed (previously members of the COSS team were mentioned, but they deny any link to it)
https://medium.com/@irfanmuhammadsyamsularief/investment-with-the-symmetry-fund-f5abafde425

**4.** Their advisor Mike Henkel also does not seem to exist, he also does not work for POLARIS Investment as claimed on the Symmetry Fund website

**5:** The advisor named Leah Kronshage was removed from the English site. When asked about it on Telegram, the admin Andrew stated: "he is an impersonator". Weird though, if you switch the language of their site to Korean, Leah is still there...

**6:** They promised to meet interested investors at the Dubai International Blockchain Summit, except no one showed up

There are better and safer investment opportunities out there. Always do your own research before investing in an ICO.

Recently i sold some of my stack in order to be able to buy the dip. I stored the FIAT on my GDAX account. Now i just check my account and see all the FIAT is gone and i suddenly have a large amount of LTC (i never bought LTC before).  I immediately sold all the LTC and transferred the money to my bankaccount. Now i see all this weird orders in my account for small amounts of LTC. I never received a message or email that someone logged in. (I use  2FA for both login and sending of funds). Please help.Blocktix has released their web app and is scheduled to release their mobile applications this week. This will be the leading complete blockchain (smart contract) based ticketing system. From their affiliations with big players in the industry, I can see Blocktix as one of the first mainstream uses of Blockchain technology that will be huge publicity for the benefits of blockchain and Ethereum. Hey guys, I already have a diversified portfolio and I reserved 1 last ETH to invest in some shill coin from Reddit. I was thinking going HAT Hawala, but they are promising fiat-crypto and I'm not sure they can delivery. So, I have 1 ETH waiting to go to some small cap coin or token but I'm out of leads.

Would you mind shilling me a coin? Low cap please, I want moon.

BTW, market will keep droping, HODL and believe, 500 billion market cap is nothing, we are just getting started.As you know Russia plan to ccept the law and legalize crypto, exchanges and exchangers. My friend has 3 domains: 1. ethereumstore.ru 2. etherstore.ru 3. ethstore.ru. How do you think an he get some money for sell them now? or maybe wait few years?I'm planning to send some ETH to get into an ICO. I expect it'll be over within minutes and I plan to complete ETH tx within a minute or two maximum. Say I wanna send 0.2 ETH via MEW - how much would you recommend for gas limit. It is automatically set at 21000. This seems a bit too high. What is the price of 1 gas? Interesting development...

https://www.rgj.com/story/money/business/2018/01/23/industrial-park-houses-tesla-gigafactory-nearly-sold-out-after-blockchains-deal/1059002001/

" Blockchains LLC, is purchasing 64,000 acres at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, with the deal expected to fully close by the first week of February, said Lance Gilman, principal and director of the industrial park.

The industrial park that plays host to Tesla, Google and Switch in the Reno area is almost sold out as a blockchain software company is finalizing plans to buy more than half of its land.

The company specializes in financial services, security, software and apps using blockchain technology  a secure digital ledger or record that is typically associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Blockchains LLC specifically deals with the Ethereum blockchain, which anchors the second-biggest cryptocurrency in the world. The Ethereum cryptocurrency is only trumped by Bitcoin in terms of market cap." 

" Blockchains will use 150 of the acres it purchased at the industrial center to build a campus park that will house the companys headquarters, Gilman said. What the company will do with the rest of the land remains to be seen.

I believe theyre going to showcase to the world everything that the blockchain technology is capable of, Gilman said. Now will they do all the work themselves or work with other developers to house other users? Only time will tell.

This might not necessarily warrant its own thread but I just wanted everyone to be aware that Coinbase (or possibly the card company) changed their merchant category code so that all credit card purchases are now treated as a cash advance. I have not confirmed this myself (only used a CC my first couple of purchases), but the reports are widespread. The change happened within the last 48 hours.

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: Thanks to /u/TrickyxWolfx for this response he received when inquiring with Chase to have the cash advance fee refunded:

&amp;nbsp;


"Hello XXX XXXX,

I am happy to assist you with the cash advance fee wavier request.

XXXX, the transaction to Coinbase dated January 20, 2018 is listed as a quasi cash transaction. It is categorized as "POI Funding Transactions(Excluding MoneySend)".

Let me share that Visa and MasterCard systems assign a category code to each merchant, based on the kinds of products and services they sell. Sometimes the system places merchants in a generalized category, like "superstores" instead of "grocery stores" or "gas stations."

I refunded your account for the two ash advance fees of $10.00 each. You'll see this adjustment on your February 9, 2018 statement.

A quasi cash transaction is one that is similar to a cash advance. Money transfers, money order purchases, gambling transactions, and other transactions where cash is accessed will be classified as quasi cash transactions. Quasi cash transactions are subject to a 5% transaction fee with a $10.00 minimum and no maximum. Also, they earn interest on a daily basis and accrue interest from the date they post to your account until paid in full.

The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for cash on your account is a variable rate of 26.24%, which is the minimum rate for cash.

We appreciate your business and thank you for being a Chase customer.

Thank you, xxxx xxxxxx"I'm creating a spreadsheet so I can keep track of everything and try to be as safe as I can be. But say you got audited even though you were being honest with your taxes, what are some things to prove to them? What are some things I should put on my spreadsheet besides my buy/sell order history? On Coinbase and GDAX when I download my CSV sometimes I see Transfer ID, Coinbase ID, Trade ID, etc, which ones am I suppose to look for and keep a record of?

According to EOS wiki [1]: 
"We expect that C++ will be the best language for developing high-performance and secure smart contracts."

Developing smart contracts has some pitfalls and can lead to vulnerabilities; we have observed them also in Ethereum's world when using solidity. However, from a technological point of view C++ is much much more difficult and therefore worse.  

As an investor you should really think about if EOS is a big deal in the long term (in case you believe in technology fundamentals)...

All-star keynote speaker lineup to be announced soon. After party included with ticket (limited spacing).

Get your tickets: https://events.bizzabo.com/dayforcryptoit's not a huge amount but still : i've bought around 150euros worth of Eth on coinbase, and it went just a lil up from what i've bought despite the crashes. I won't bore you with the cents etc, but my account dropped from about 150 to 130euros and i have more ETH than when i've started to "invest"... Anybody has an explanation/same problem? (and i've thought about the variation of the euro itself, still doesn't make sense, it's like 20euros have gone poof)Rookie to crypto here, have some portfolio tools but all seem to present portfolio in FIAT instead of ether/btc primarily. I.e. Delta says my portfolio is x, up y while actually my portfolio in ether is down with z. So, not helpful if you're looking to grow in ether.

Any tools, tips or pointers to a portfolio site, app or something that I can use?I don't know exactly but it's a least very sluggish transactions.I posted similar thoughts on ripple (formerly ripple labs) and about xrp and just raising questions in utility and store of value. The company loves it because it makes them billionaires but was never their intent. Received like a bag of rocks, I was thrown out as a fudster except for the mod who was curious. Ps I worked in a bank and reviewed early use cases for ripple.Not sure what issue you are suggesting.... Id say use MEW, not the Chrome Application. Then they (he and she) are truly the one that was foretoldwhat do you exactly mean? i cannot use my nano ledger? Chihuahua's Red Rocket?Can we talk about Stellar vs. OMG? I own both, but I'm thinking of selling my Stellar +profits for more OMG.

Thoughts?Username checks out.They have an api/app problem since some days ago*skeptically buys zrx*This bothers me a lot. If blockchain is so decentralised how come it is so easy traced back to an individual? What is stopping the gov to just block all exchange and no one can get their money out?Double-check your balance then! Do they have an actual routing system yet?  Because if not and they're still brute-forcing it as a full broadcast network... It's not going to be a scaling solution.I think it's worldwide https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7t2t1y/psa_buying_crypto_with_a_cc_on_coinbase/Definitely satirical.Oh, cool.Oh Boy!

Am I an old person not understanding all this new shit now? :( We got some itty bitty 6h cuecombers, let me tell you what.Any fellow Canadians out there that can confirm what changes coinbase has made? Something about extra cash advance fees or something? Sounds like a successful strategy. Do you ever sell out completely? I like to always keep some of the stack.Yeah, I thought it would hit 1.90 again, but too late it seemsthere were folks here saying she deleted because NEO pumped after she said that. i dont believe that to be true, but i do believe she knows something about NEO that we don't..Damn here comes ZRX againIt's already too late. Everyone has screenshots Is large ok?She's definitely got some insider info, but looks like she also suggested selling NEO literally the day before its big pump.  I'd say use the info, don't follow the trading advice, heh.I'm dumb. Context?Sharding is arguably more important than POS.

It's what's needed if we want Eth to get to Visa levels of transactions.I guess we'll see.
It dropped to like 1.30 about a week or two ago already Yeah, was definitely off on that one. NEO 2x'ed within 3-4 days of that post.I mean, Starbucks already sounds like a crypto currency.they're still pretty heavy lol"sharding" will never stop making me giggleGlad I could helpWill it be too much of an ask to provide a high level one liners for each of these things?

ezpz defies your silly definitions. He's a champ, plain and simple. He suffered for our gains.Yeah I think the Nov./Dec. hype brought in tons of new money, and then the drop scared them away.

But..now I know what you mean.Thanks!cool good to know cryptothrowaway324 might as well be the new Satoshi Nakamoto Yea, it's ultimately all up to how you like to trade alts.  Ultimately, ETH is the only thing I truly believe in with crypto, so every trade I make is to gain more ETH.  I'm a bit more conservative than most and like to start scaling out of alt positions a little earlier than most.  I'm also a big believer in 'sell the news', so I start accelerating my sells as we get closer to expected news.  Some questions about EZPZ, is he...

- [A stupid kid](https://strawpoll.com/213zfrwf)
- [A crazy depressed person who regrets selling his ETH](https://strawpoll.com/213zfrwf)
- [A person who truly believes in what he thinks](https://strawpoll.com/213zfrwf)
- [A troll who's loving this shit](https://strawpoll.com/213zfrwf)And in 1 year, 1 ether will cost more than one bitcoin.Closer to 4,000%, but who's counting :-)

Think I should sell yet?  lolperhaps its Satoshi making a come backBATShe didntNot sure, bought some yesterday because it was new to kucoin. But Ethically i wont shill it because I dont know yet.There were a few more near the end of her time here. Can't recall which onesI bought in at like 1.92 before it dipped.There are too many shotcoins man - you went full retard... never go full retard.Could you explain a bit further? I'm aware of the potential of PoS but not so much on sharding?Is ICN down from ICO?
I've been thinking of getting some.Interesting thing is that the CMC ETH price is above the price needed to break the pennant and GDAX is lagging by ~$10. We see this most frequently when GDAX is the last one to break through a USD psychological barrier. That might be the load up needed to set the arb bots up for a break through with volume. TBD.I hear ya man, gotta respect the nice round numbers!Bot as in singular. But I meant a single entity (which may contain multiple bots working together)

Edit: I wish AIDSFinex didnt infect the eth network with its TAIDS.In about a month, 1 Ethereum will cost more than 1 Bitcoin Cash. Been comparing the trend data for both and Bitcoin Cash is on a downwards trajectory, being pulled at a faster deceleration rate by Bitcoin than Ethereum. From my projections, 1 ETH will cost more than 1 BCH by the 24th of February.Yea, though said it would be later in the year, IIRC.  It's hard not to like this ETH ratio for buying OMG right now, though.Starbucks Korea already working with Qtum...let me guessWelcome to the Daily Altcoin Discussion thread of /r/EthTrader.

/r/binance $10+ ETH withdrawal fee is ridiculous. I love the platform, but I am getting transactions cleared on the Ethereum network within minutes for $0.75. This is theft, and other exchanges are not charging these absurd fees. I was not really sensitive to this before, as I was moving large amounts, but I needed to move a little ETH to an address for gas purposes and realised how crazy 0.01 is. The minimum withdrawal is 0.1, and 0.01 represents 10% of this. Just pure insanity.

EDIT: Title should read: 0.01, not 0.10, but post content is correct.I'm curious as to what opinions/basis people have for what would happen to cryptomarkets, and commodities (gold, silver, etc.) If the stock market as a whole took a relatively large downturn?I keep posting everywhere but it seems I can't reach anyone, so I guess I'll comment here where it all began. I lost all my eth today, and I don't know what to do. I had all my coins at coincheck and they were hacked and stopped withdrawals seems they will go down, and I lost everything. I don't ask for sympathy, but does anyone know of anything I can do? I had other coins in there too, which was very valuable but, I keep trying to reach people, and I don't know where to go now. The main problem is I'm not Japanese and can't do anything. Does anyone know if the exchange might come back?

Edit: I think my comments aren't going through, so I'll write here, I'm hearing now that some news articles are saying that the exchange might not return in Japan, this really has me nervous. https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXMZO26234720X20C18A1MM0000/?nf=1
I don't know if to retain hope, I had done this for my son, so I'm kind of freaking out.I've been using Gemini for trading now for quite a while with no real issues. Today I tried to do a trade and it says my account is frozen and unable to transfer funds or trade. I have not tried to add additional funds or modify the account in any way recently. Has anyone encountered this before? I have contacted them I am just concerned that they will be slow in responding (as they have been in the past)

I've tried searching around for anyone in the same situation and after reading about others I am beginning to get concerned. Its difficult to follow up on any posts to see what the outcome was, but I could really use some reassurance at the moment.

If anyone has had their Gemini account locked at some point in the last few months could you please respond and let me know how your situation was resolved. Thank you. Not trying to spread FUD, I'm just concerned (and irritated).https://i.imgur.com/280O8u5.jpg

A very impactful name in the cryptocurrency community (current united nations block chain advisor {new position as of this year}) was giving a lot of interviews this past week at Davos with a make America great again hat on. Knowing him personally it makes me wonder if the community has any idea of background regarding the faces that are representing us.

To clarify: When I went to high school with him he wore militarized gear with nazi salutes often writing lengthy threatening posts under the pics of him saluting about harming others in one of America's most Jewish towns. He thinks he's in the illuminati (not confirmed if he actually is lol). During this time he found bitcoin and was the first in our state to successfully mine with his super computer he built called the Hive (it's quite impressive i'll give him that). He then threatened the entire police force in our town and they had to arrest him for the threats, when he payed his way out he put threats on certain officers families after heated Facebook arguments (remember the hat). Our high school added extra security during this time. He got out of all that due to his dad being highly ranked at the UN (how he got the current advisor job) then went into exile into Thailand. During this time he got married and had kids with a fellow classmate. Few years later he snaps and pulls out an AR on random people in Thailand, once again dad bails him out and the press protects him after the initial story airs. He then beats his wife and maid after seeking exile in Thailand. His wife gets out of Thailand and he's put into Thai jail until you guessed it dad makes a few calls. Most recently he fucked over a mutual buddy that gave him shelter after he was allowed back into America under Trump. (He has strings with people at Trump's Whitehouse it seems...not confirmed). He felt he could fuck my buddy over because he" holds power that people value and want more of" hence why we are posting this. I wish I couldn't make this up. Once the proper discussion is brought forth I'd be glad to share proof of everything. 

How are we going to let this happen? More standards need to be set forth or people like this will represent us with embarrassment. This post is partially made to trash him because he is a POS but it is made to bring to light some issues in the community. I hope a proper discussion comes of this about qualifications of representation.Hi guys,

So I've been hodling for a few months and it's a great way to insure you're good to go.

However, recently, I've decided to use a few Ks to try and daytrade on the ETH, just for fun. Not really pro active, and few limit orders a day (3-4), the classical buy low, sell high(er), buy lower, sell higher. 

I managed to make a few hundreds during that time, and around 1 ETH, even when the market was correcting.

However today, having bought at 850, I saw it dip to 800, then read the news about Coincheck. I thought it was going to drop even more so I decided to realise the loss and sell, to buy lower. It did not dip and instead went back up to 850.

So I lost money on the sale, and now if I buy back, I'm losing ETH. Double loss. 

What did I do wrong, what should I have done differently? Stop order? Bad reading of the markets?

https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@matthew-analysis/daily-crypto-analysis-26th-jan-technical-analysisPlease take this with a grain of salt, there are no facts on anything that I'll be presenting, and this post is full of speculation and assumption.

By now you may have heard that Vince McMahon is planning on bringing back the XFL following the 2019-2020 NFL regular season, and you're probably thinking, "Why in the world would he do that?"  The former Xtreme Football League only lasted one season and was a horrible attempt at competing against the NFL, however, I think a new league can hold merit.

Several FAQs from the current XFL.com website:
*An opportunity exists to reimagine Americas favorite sport by putting fans at the center while leveraging a changing media landscape and evolving consumer viewing behavior.
*The new XFL is a single entity structure with plans for eight teams at launch, all of which will be owned by the league.
*The players' salary structure is still in development, but players will be paid to play and paid more to win.

Additionally, Vince McMahon aims to "re-imagine" football, and despite the former failed XFL venture, he is a proven businessman with a strong ability to make money.

Still, it sounds crazy and many are assuming it will fail again.  I like to try to see both sides, and Vince McMahon is a person who likes to be on the forefront new and radical ideas.  He took the Olympic sport of wrestling and transformed it into an entertaining global spectacle, and managed to raise his net worth to an excess of $1 Billion.  I'm not going to be so quick to dismiss his ideas and track record.

Now, why I think he can pull this off:
'Fans' are not going to exist early on, because there is no history or fandom to be had, thus we'll need to add incentive.  As a potential consumer, what would generate my interest?  Incentive and a lot of it.
*Give spectators the opportunity to control the game, so they have built in stake, similar to this idea (https://fcfl.io/thank-you.php?__s=uq1p6p2xkhgsthtbhpwp).  By tuning into the game, I can vote on which plays I want to be called, but let's take it even a step further.  
*Discounts - in stadium discounts for attending, correctly choosing plays, etc.
*Player endorsement incentives - We remember Rod "He Hate Me" Smart, but what if we had Tom "Amazon" Brady.  Give players the right to sell the name on their back to highest bid
*Fractional Team Ownership - The XFL can sell off fractions of each team and you can become the GM.  Fandom and viewership doesn't have to stop on Sundays.  You can now help negotiate the day-to-days through consensus ownership
*True fan loyalty - We all know someone that flip flops their fandom, but what if you were rewarded for staking your fandom based on length of time?
*Other things to be voted on: rules/regulations, team names and future locations, jersey colors and logos, etc.

Just a few small ideas, but the more I think about it, the more I think it can make sense.  Would love to hear everyone's thoughts

EDIT: this is just one of many listings.  They are hiring a ton of people to build this thing.  It's all centered on Ethereum.Hey Chaps, I wanted to invest in Symmetry ICO but found this nice summary of red flags so I thought it might help some of you. IMHO they are scam... 

-----------------------

[Source: Wolf Crypto News Telegram]

**Symmetry Fund - ICO Redflags**

If you are thinking about investing in Symmetry Fund ICO I would advise increased caution. Website and Whitepaper look very professional but digging deeper into the project, a number of red flags appear:


**1.** All LinkedIn team member profiles seem to be rather new, no recommendations present
  -&gt; they also seem not to exist outside LinkedIn / Symmetry fund website

**2:** There is no direct link between the Symmetry fund website and a real person:
-&gt; someone contacted the consulting lawyer who advised them, but he claims to never meet at any of the individuals behind the fund or saw any papers
-&gt; website of symmetry itself is registered through a hosting/DNS lookup protecting   
   construction (Domains by proxy), so is fully anonymous
https://www.whois.com/whois/symmetry.fund

**3:** all their advisors have been changed (previously members of the COSS team were mentioned, but they deny any link to it)
https://medium.com/@irfanmuhammadsyamsularief/investment-with-the-symmetry-fund-f5abafde425

**4.** Their advisor Mike Henkel also does not seem to exist, he also does not work for POLARIS Investment as claimed on the Symmetry Fund website

**5:** The advisor named Leah Kronshage was removed from the English site. When asked about it on Telegram, the admin Andrew stated: "he is an impersonator". Weird though, if you switch the language of their site to Korean, Leah is still there...
https://symmetry.fund/#team
https://symmetry.fund/kr/#team

**6:** They promised to meet interested investors at the Dubai International Blockchain Summit, except no one showed up

There are better and safer investment opportunities out there. Always do your own research before investing in an ICO.

Recently i sold some of my stack in order to be able to buy the dip. I stored the FIAT on my GDAX account. Now i just check my account and see all the FIAT is gone and i suddenly have a large amount of LTC (i never bought LTC before).  I immediately sold all the LTC and transferred the money to my bankaccount. Now i see all this weird orders in my account for small amounts of LTC. I never received a message or email that someone logged in. (I use  2FA for both login and sending of funds). Please help.Blocktix has released their web app and is scheduled to release their mobile applications this week. This will be the leading complete blockchain (smart contract) based ticketing system. From their affiliations with big players in the industry, I can see Blocktix as one of the first mainstream uses of Blockchain technology that will be huge publicity for the benefits of blockchain and Ethereum. Hey guys, I already have a diversified portfolio and I reserved 1 last ETH to invest in some shill coin from Reddit. I was thinking going HAT Hawala, but they are promising fiat-crypto and I'm not sure they can delivery. So, I have 1 ETH waiting to go to some small cap coin or token but I'm out of leads.

Would you mind shilling me a coin? Low cap please, I want moon.

BTW, market will keep droping, HODL and believe, 500 billion market cap is nothing, we are just getting started.As you know Russia plan to ccept the law and legalize crypto, exchanges and exchangers. My friend has 3 domains: 1. ethereumstore.ru 2. etherstore.ru 3. ethstore.ru. How do you think an he get some money for sell them now? or maybe wait few years?I'm planning to send some ETH to get into an ICO. I expect it'll be over within minutes and I plan to complete ETH tx within a minute or two maximum. Say I wanna send 0.2 ETH via MEW - how much would you recommend for gas limit. It is automatically set at 21000. This seems a bit too high. What is the price of 1 gas? Interesting development...

https://www.rgj.com/story/money/business/2018/01/23/industrial-park-houses-tesla-gigafactory-nearly-sold-out-after-blockchains-deal/1059002001/

" Blockchains LLC, is purchasing 64,000 acres at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, with the deal expected to fully close by the first week of February, said Lance Gilman, principal and director of the industrial park.

The industrial park that plays host to Tesla, Google and Switch in the Reno area is almost sold out as a blockchain software company is finalizing plans to buy more than half of its land.

The company specializes in financial services, security, software and apps using blockchain technology  a secure digital ledger or record that is typically associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Blockchains LLC specifically deals with the Ethereum blockchain, which anchors the second-biggest cryptocurrency in the world. The Ethereum cryptocurrency is only trumped by Bitcoin in terms of market cap." 

" Blockchains will use 150 of the acres it purchased at the industrial center to build a campus park that will house the companys headquarters, Gilman said. What the company will do with the rest of the land remains to be seen.

I believe theyre going to showcase to the world everything that the blockchain technology is capable of, Gilman said. Now will they do all the work themselves or work with other developers to house other users? Only time will tell.

This might not necessarily warrant its own thread but I just wanted everyone to be aware that Coinbase (or possibly the card company) changed their merchant category code so that all credit card purchases are now treated as a cash advance. I have not confirmed this myself (only used a CC my first couple of purchases), but the reports are widespread. The change happened within the last 48 hours.

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: Thanks to /u/TrickyxWolfx for this response he received when inquiring with Chase to have the cash advance fee refunded:

&amp;nbsp;


"Hello XXX XXXX,

I am happy to assist you with the cash advance fee wavier request.

XXXX, the transaction to Coinbase dated January 20, 2018 is listed as a quasi cash transaction. It is categorized as "POI Funding Transactions(Excluding MoneySend)".

Let me share that Visa and MasterCard systems assign a category code to each merchant, based on the kinds of products and services they sell. Sometimes the system places merchants in a generalized category, like "superstores" instead of "grocery stores" or "gas stations."

I refunded your account for the two ash advance fees of $10.00 each. You'll see this adjustment on your February 9, 2018 statement.

A quasi cash transaction is one that is similar to a cash advance. Money transfers, money order purchases, gambling transactions, and other transactions where cash is accessed will be classified as quasi cash transactions. Quasi cash transactions are subject to a 5% transaction fee with a $10.00 minimum and no maximum. Also, they earn interest on a daily basis and accrue interest from the date they post to your account until paid in full.

The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for cash on your account is a variable rate of 26.24%, which is the minimum rate for cash.

We appreciate your business and thank you for being a Chase customer.

Thank you, xxxx xxxxxx"I'm creating a spreadsheet so I can keep track of everything and try to be as safe as I can be. But say you got audited even though you were being honest with your taxes, what are some things to prove to them? What are some things I should put on my spreadsheet besides my buy/sell order history? On Coinbase and GDAX when I download my CSV sometimes I see Transfer ID, Coinbase ID, Trade ID, etc, which ones am I suppose to look for and keep a record of?

According to EOS wiki [1]: 
"We expect that C++ will be the best language for developing high-performance and secure smart contracts."

Developing smart contracts has some pitfalls and can lead to vulnerabilities; we have observed them also in Ethereum's world when using solidity. However, from a technological point of view C++ is much much more difficult and therefore worse.  

As an investor you should really think about if EOS is a big deal in the long term (in case you believe in technology fundamentals)...

A "Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game Card Game".  Thats the most idiotic thing i have ever heard.
Nice buzzwords tho.

Euro bros. You get this thing past $1100 tonight and Ill personally shave all your womens armpits  so you can see how glorious it feels to lick a ladys armpits. Im open to other favors as well Me either
You lucked cause your a small populous and most dont have much money, so youre insignificant.  The states are a bigger fish!AwsomeI never understood why OMG is being nerfed so much.Exactly. Trying to trigger panic sells and stop loss orders to maximize his profits.Im using radarrelay to buy rnHaha I remember I was so scared of xrp plummeting down , when I saw it's massive uptrend from .40 to .47 I jumped off, I thought that was it. Sleep ? Who sleeps here i have my phone projecting the gdax charts on my ceiling when i sleep so i never miss anything Hawaii checking in...wide awake!What evidence have you found? You know that ethereum has raiden and plasma right?
Ethereum is technically better than bitcoin in literally every possible aspect. There seems to be an opinion on these individual crypto coin sub reddits, especially ethereum, that there is only 1 "true coin".  

Every top coin/token is overpriced except Etheruem is the main take away from this subreddit.  This is coming from someone who has 25-30% of my crypto value on Ethereum.What boggles my mind is that OMG was $12.00 about 7 months ago. While everything else grew, its done very little. And its currently $16. Its due for a serious insane breakout ZRX General Discussion?Learning how to move coins around is pretty important, as that is the whole reason any of these coins have value. 

If you're not japanese, why are you holding all your coins on a japanese exchange?looks like we broke the wedge upwardsIts starting to climb at an unusual hour than what Ive been seeing lately. So somethings up. The train is gonna leave while some of us are sleeping. Luckily I sleep with one eye open on the candles chart.Where do I trade this?

edit: https://www.kucoin.com/#/trade.pro/CAN-ETH
nice descending wedge, looks readyA common misconception that withdrawal fee should be same as a transaction fee for the network. Its just another fee like the trading fee. Its a free market and they can choose whatever fees they want, just like their trading fee is very low compared to other exchanges.

You dont have to use it, but you have the right to complain about it of course =)The more I learned about Binance the more I'd rather use nearly any other exchange. They're extremely greedy.Anybody have a link to this cryptothrowaway post?[**Here's your Reddit Silver, dashby1!**](http://i.imgur.com/x0jw93q.png "Reddit Silver")

I challenge you to source this statement, otherwise, this is just an outright lie.
aww, love how things repeat itself here since years pretty much...

govs ban crypto, people predict the future....

entertaining to say the leastOh gosh, with all these games, I think Ethereum is gonna have to do quite a bit more transactions than VISA.reddit is like 1 week late for everything. So will be for this.
When you see it on 4chan and telegram its hot. And been seeing it there.Trading genius reveals market secrets. ZRX runnning againSomeday in future you wake up and hear that the earth stopped spinning and half of the world population is planning to eat the other half. You shall hear spaceships are selling tickets to March and beyond. Each ticket costs 1 ETH. 

Then you realize how retarded smart you were when you bought 1 ETH for $1k.

Buy ETH while the earth still spins.Because he missed the train when it was less than one cent lol.Ok so what do coins like Electroneum or Veritaseum do and why do they have market caps higher than REQ?It's been up and running for about a week. There's very little volume and it's ugly. People seem to be reading your comment as Coinbase own this dex..they don't. Toshi is a mobile dapp browser and messenger. like we care.Higher than now. I think it will. They kinda have toWASASASASWAAAAUP
You see, you really don't make any sense and you contradict yourself. For once you don't like the Lightning Network and then you proceed to state that the Raiden Network is great. 

I'm more familiar with the Lightning Network than with the Raiden Network simply because the Lightning Network is already working whereas Raiden Network is not.

Also Raiden Network has a useless token that was created just for the sake of having an ICO to profit from the ICO craze, whereas the Lightning Network is actually free and doesn't involve any new tokens, just bitcoins.

Now let me address your previous comment, first Bitcoin is not searching for a savior because it already works as the high fees indicate that there is high demand for doing a Bitcoin transactions because people transacting in Bitcoin knows that once the transaction is included in a block there is no way that transaction will get revoked because Bitcoin is actually trust-less and doesn't rely on a leader that can revoke certain transactions at will.

RSK is a sidechain of Bitcoin that people can use to execute smart contract or to transact between them, so it can also be used for moving some of Bitcoin transaction from Bitcoin blockchain to the RSK blockchain, these type of transaction are off-chain to Bitcoin but are on-chain RSK blockchain.

Lightning Network as stated above is already working so I don't know what you are talking about. As with any new software it comes out as a beta and then after enough testing it will improve, but the key here is that it's already working and brave people are already using it to buy stuff online.Bye.So CAN (ERC20) listed on CMC and its not 200 mil cap as people here FUDDED but less than 40 mil.
And they have a global launch in 2 weeks.top kek

Tesla was also mentioned as part of Dubais vision for a smart city implemented with ethereum

Jan 30th was a date she said.

I was skeptical at first but Im finding more and more evidence linking it all together. Everyone is late on ZRX for now. It can't stay hard all night people.Would love an explanation as wellApparently you do not have to be consistent and can pick and chose.

ETH TAKE ME ENERGY! 

LAMBO ALERT!Wait a second... 921 + 511 + 921 is 2353, if we take out the double numbers thats 25. Its the 26th of January which means the 25th day of the 1st month was yesterday or 1/25, 1 divided by 25 is 0.04 or roughly half the ETH/BTC ratio now. Bet you thought I was going somewhere with that, didnt you.Robinhood is about to drop these kids into Vietnam I swear. Lolreported for wash tradingRaiden actually works, because of fundamental differences in the way Ethereum works versus Bitcoin it actually can ve a decent scaling solution.  But is only a part of the full roadmap, for a good reason.  Off chain scaling has its uses, but onchain still will need to handle massive volume.Ah, gotcha!

It was ZRZ, OMG, ETH, RLC and a few others. January 30th will come and go, but almost surely someone will show up to boast about how it was a joke and so many people took it seriously. Which they always do. Thanks man.  Seems good.  Can't access the coins I have on coincheck yet but they are all still there and seems like I will be able to get them back once they reopen ETH trading.

My wife has a small number of NEM - around 20,000.  coincheck have told her she will be refunded in yen at 85 per NEM.  Not too bad all in all.  Could have been much worse!yes, it does that from time to time.I'm really interested to see how these things work out. I thought it was just a joke when I read the site, but put a little chunk in for fun and now it's gone up 5x already. I mean, it's just a pyramid scheme, but what have I got to lose by putting some more ETH in now? It can only keep getting more popular, right?

And the whole time he wasnt trying to prove how smart he was, he was only trying to help.
Dont really blame him for not hanging out with us.All I have seen over the past months is speculation and FUD.  Never have I encountered any facts. 

The fact this relationship has ended Spurs a lot of speculation and FUD. I do miss transparency, but we just dont know what is going on beneath the hood. 

Wouldnt it be nice if we could verify how much $ is coming in and thus how many tethers are printed? Oh, wait, DAI . 

Yep the kucoin vote was going on during that time. We didn't won but they just updated that they signed an nda with kucoin which most likely means the ceo is paying to get listed which he said he would if we didnt win the voteThis is precious.

It is not locked in, but I was asked to speak on this topic in May.  I plan to speak on ransomware and how it is transitioning from bitcoin to monero, and to bring up ether, but looking for suggestions.

I don't think I can get too technical, but want to being up hardware wallets, exchanges, forex, day trading, mining, and knowing how to buy crypto quickly if a client is ransomed and wants to pay.  Looking for advice on other topics.

I am assuming I will have 15 minutes, but will know more as time goes on.  I used to work for Intel as a tech evangelist so I am comfortable on the presenting part, but I want to do the best for my audience and the overall community.

Thanks!I was surprised to find out recently that not many people in the Ethereum community know about r/TipJarBot/ I want to spread awareness about it, so I am going to send a 0.007 ETH tip to the first 55 people to comment here.

Also, check out a dapp that I spent time thinking about and building that makes it possible for your family to trustlessly get your Ether (and ETH tokens) in case something happens to you.

https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@matthew-analysis/daily-crypto-analysis-28th-jan-technical-analysisHi, a friend of mine is currently traveling in China and needs to send me some money soi can buy a festival ticket on his behalf. Sending through fiat avenues seems excessively cumbersome and expensive, does anyone in here have experience on how he can buyeth with a UnionPay card? Got loads of experiance with western markets but I'm a bit baffled at the prospect of expaining how to buy crypto with chinese fiat to a guy who hasnt even torrented a film before. Would appreicate it if anyone could helpI saw a post earlier that said that Tether is about to collapse and it would bring Btfinex's shutdown. Should I really be worried?
The thing is, that I have not so much alts inside to remove them all at once( thanks to the new minimum withdraw limit) and I will have to do this over a  period of 2 weeks. Should I be concerced?
Thanks in advance!Wow, this has been a surprising coin to hide in the last month. I traded my free BCash for ETH, but I think the BTC/ETH ratio is at full value now. With the amount of inflation ETH has we should dip back to .10 and linger in the .095-.105 range for awhile unless there's some fundamental reason to break higher. Happy trading!Have been reading about tether, and like mostly everyone I agree that they're likely printing tethers out of thing air to buy cryptos - and concerned about possible impact to BTC and ETH as market leaders.

But it's also pretty clear, since you can't redeem tethers for actual dollars, they can't fail by running out of dollars to pay for tether redemptions. 

Moreover, in order to maintain the "appearance" of a peg, all they need to do is buy/sell small amounts of tether (from their larges reserves of crypto bought with printed tethers) on their associated exchanges to create an appearance of a market for tether. Once newer users or other see these small trades, it reinforces the idea that the real value is near $1. 

Like anyone else on these subreddits, I don't like the idea of things being printed out of thin air, but with no redemption mechanism, and the means to easily manipulate the price, I don't see another mechanism for this to cause a crash. 

I can see only the bright future for ethereum but I can see it only when the infrastructure will be there. I try to invest in all of the ICOs that are building it. Would appreciate ICO suggestions with strong tech team and no "give me fast *100 gain"

Thanks in advance!Why, why can't this moment last forevermore?

Suspend belief for a moment with me and step back to the early days of crypto.  Lets pretend your only choices for trading pairs were ETH and BTC.  Cyclical booms and busts have happened for the past 9 years and now ICO-mania is in full swing.  You are constantly being marketed to by high schoolers, bots, and living memes.  Now, battle-hardened and fiscally responsible, you can spot a scam within a few clicks of research. 

You come on to ETH Trader and read about a novel idea for a new coin.  The company wants to peg their coin to major fiat currencies.  They call it RealCoin and, perhaps realizing how fake that makes it sound, changes it to the much sexier *Tether.*  

You go over to [the web site](https://tether.to/) and take a look at the white paper, where you read about novel Proof of _____ systems.  You click on links to see how their reserves are kept and are led to the [Omni website](http://omnichest.info/lookupsp.aspx?sp=31).  Too many links lead to dead pages.  Thats odd.  Maybe your background isnt in computer science, so youll ask about it on reddit. 

Maybe you want to look at a couple of key players on the team: 

- CEO [J.L. van der Velde](https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-l-van-der-velde-26a24b6/) doesnt even list Tether on there. Thats odd, too!
+ CFO [Giancarlo Devasini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giancarlo-devasini-268758154/) (nickname: The Ghost) looks like a bot who isnt even trying.

Are they on social media?  [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tether.to) looks a little outdated.  Thats questionable, but maybe its supposed to be a memorial page.  And why does their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Tether_to/) contrast so much with their company [press](https://tether.to/press/) page?

At this point, I think a few well placed questions to the community are in order:
&gt;Is there something missing?  Is there a better metric that should be used for Tether?

&gt;If there was nothing more than [60 million dollars](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Final-Tether-Consulting-Report-9-15-17_Redacted.pdf) in a redacted persons account earmarked for Tether, how would this affect a market that believes a coin is backed by reserves equaling ~33 times more than that?

Please help me understand if any of my thoughts are off the mark.  I am still learning.  Thanks.

**TL;DR I would pass on this ICO.**

Edit: Formatting. Ten-x app updated this morning...I tried to see if I could order a card and looked at country drop down and voila....U.S. is supported...I pre-ordered my card for $15....wooohoooFirst I'd like to say there is no hard evidence for this theory just a bit of circumstantial evidence that I am shoehorning to fit my narrative.  (Like the 2 other theories out there)

## The Theory: FUD is being pushed everytime the bitfinex funding rate falls

A lot of money is made when the funding rate is high, by users lending and by bitfinex charging 15% fees.  So there is a very clear financial incentive to increase that funding rate.

Below is the funding rate for the last 12 months, I am going to try and link some of the spikes with increased FUD.

https://imgur.com/mDcLIyz

### April

Let's start in April 2017, Bitfinex'ed [joined twitter](https://twitter.com/Bitfinexed) and began to post full time about tether and that it was all a house of cards.  This was paired with constant posts on many reddit subs, medium posts, steemit articles, etc.

This built for about a week or 2 until we saw a panic begin, people ended their funding (can take 2 to 60 days) and started to sell their tether into cryptos, driving those prices up on bitfinex.  It also left the funding market with less liquidity which causes the rates to skyrocket.

### October

There was renewed FUD using the BCH fork and bitfinex's decision to stop supporting individual US customers, it began in august but didn't seem to take hold until october nearly a month after the US announcement.  People only then began to equate the US service restriction to tether with the contasant help of trolls.  This caused bitfinex to issue a clarification around that time.

### Wash trading 

I remember them getting a lot of traction with FUD about wash trading but I can't remember when exactly, the start of December??

### Now

Friedman LLP removed bitfinex from there list of customers, this was noticed about a week ago but as usual it takes time to build a bit of panic and get some traction with FUD.  Expect to see funding rates begin to go up depending on how long they can keep this up.


## Bonus Conspiracy 

This post has been quite pro bitfinex so far, 'it is all FUD bitfinex is fine'.  But what if they are in on the FUD.  MAybe there reluctance to do an audit is so they can continue to undermined tether so they can keep the lending rate high.  15% of all interest is quite an incentive.


## Other Theories

As mentioned at the start their are other theories that have as much proof as this one (namely none), so in the spirit of fairness here they are.

1. Bitfinex/tether is a scam and will eventually collapse leaving USDT and probably any funds on bitfinex worthless.

2. Bitfinex is a start up company that suddenly found itself worth billions and are trying their best to keep the skies on enough to continue to rack in millions a day in fees.  Lack of audits, bad support itc are just growing pains.

If you pick the correct theory and trade accordingly you will likely make a lot of money, good luck.

Thanks for reading.

Roller coasters (since this is crypto) will come...but we are headed to great times.

*Edit: Forgot the most important thing: I wanted to add "With the right fundamentals" (tech + use cases + developers)*Super important but still not sure how to evaluate coins on that. Lets say there is 1000 XY coins available on market, someone buy/sell only 5 coins for 10 USD. That will set the price for XY coin and push the market cap to 10k while you had only 50 USD entry.

How will you evaluate coins with high ratio between market cap and daily volume?

Is there someone experienced with trading stocks? Is such info even important for future price movements?
I'm installing MIST but, if I understood it correctly, it downloads the whole blockhain. I dont have that much disksize.

I have also metamask, but it's an extension. Very limited visually to work on it.

Is there another wallet where I can hold my coins, deploy contracts, but without downloading the whole blockchain?Welcome to the Daily Altcoin Discussion thread of /r/EthTrader.

Vitalik recently tweeted about fee volatility being a huge problem with Ethereum. As a dApp developer that's constantly thinking about fee economics and optimizing dApp interactions around it, it would be amazing if Ethereum fees were cheap and predictable...TEAM token (Ethereum, ERC-20 standard) is a utility token, designed to enable
interaction between fans, celebrities (prospective talents &amp; successful pros),
advertisers, and regular token holders.
TEAM tokens serve as the form of access to the TokenStars platform and its
internal currency. Most of the interactions require usage of TEAMs:
 payment of agency commissions from advertisers and supported talents;
 providing incentives to scouts and fans, who discover prospective talents
and promote celebrities;
 communicating with celebrities and getting access to exclusive offers;
 making betting bids and winning;
 participating in the voting polls;
that will result in higher token turnover along with the course of TokenStars
business growth.I've been working on creating a python 3 crypto currency coin price checker that will display the current prices of the coins that are listed. I currently use it on my raspberry pi with a display attached and have it running under my monitor. It is currently able to grab prices from coinmarketcap, bittrex, poloniex. It uses the public api for those 3 but I will continue to be adding more sources that support public apis along with those that require a key such as binance. This is just a side project for me and its the first time I've every advertised my own projects to people outside of school. I wouldn't mind if you guys contribute to the project or put in some requests using the issues tab on github.

Has anyone gotten a real grasp of it and can share his/her opinion on it?

I heard the company patented it (boo!) but has not put out an ico or similar (yay?).

They seem to have partnerships as well, which I wasnt able to find anything out about.

Would love to hear your thoughts!https://imgur.com/a/yJBLp

Some Precomments:

1. Yes, there is no BTC in my portfolio. All of my Bitcoin needs are taken care of by XMR and XRB. 
2. SPANK has earned its Tier II spot organically. I have not allocated any more funds to SPANK since its ICO.

Not my text, but this is a good one.


1. They already have a working product which is being trialed successfully in Australia, note that this is at an MVP stage with the global launch of a fully functional product soon (March 2018) 

2. The technical team is very strong and they have had good experience developing commercial grade software and apps in the past so they know what they are doing. They also seem to have researched their competitors well. This space will have competition but the aim is to ensure that one is ahead of the pack which I think this team will be able to achieve. I also think that the global P2P marketplace is huge so there should be no issues having 2 or 3 strong players easily being able to coexist here. Plus the fact they have a strong focus in the Asian (China and India and others) market will help since these are booming yet nascent p2p marketplaces ATM. 

3. The team is going in the right direction it seems with respect to ensuring it starts off with a strong, large globally aware community. This includes the acquisition of bountysource as well as the more recent partnership with Earn and hopefully more strong engagements to come. Going forward I would love to see them establishing local CanYa teams in immediate markets they have identified globally so the word gets out there and so that the adoption is quick and persistent. I am quite confident that are at it though. It would be nice to see this happening in parallel with the global product launch.

https://www.kucoin.com/#/trade.pro/CAN-ETHI'm aware if the DNS to a DEX is compromised while signing transactions I am at risk. If the DNS / website is safe at the time of signing a transaction but gets hacked in the future are they still able to get access to my wallet?

I ask because it's the first time I've used a DEX (usually use Binance) and sending the ETH through MetaMask it gave me a warning that signing a transaction is not secure and to ensure I only sign if I absolutely trust the site.Or reaching a milestone on the road map. Would some of you dare to make general exclamations regarding to that?

Do the prices in general then raise? If so, do they mostly drop again shortly afterwards to a certain point? Maybe for some reason even below  the previous price tag? Do you have any comparable examples? Are there good articles to read about?Sure, ERC dEX was listed in Toshi, which is big in its own way, given that there aren't alot of options to browse dApps on mobile at the moment, apart from Metamask (extension for Chrome - desktop) and Brave (desktop version).

But a timetraveller spoke and the real ride may have yet to come...that's what she said: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7e6uiq/daily_general_discussion_november_20_2017/dq48tqq/So I have discovered ETH this year.  Hooray, some money was made. Did some mining, awesome, free money. I also discovered Bittrex and Etherdelta and other exchanges. Also etheroll. And cryptokitties. Among other things. 

I have kept great track of the amount of cash I have put in. And I know what my portfolio was valued most days of the year, and recorded buys and sells to actual real USD.  Which is all I thought I really needed for tax purposes. No I am feeling concerned about not reporting enough. But I can't even make sense of some of my addresses and transfers anymore. 

Anyone else just floored by the amount of activity they need to sort through from this year? Any suggestions if even bitcoin.tax is not helping?  I have a dozen or more eth addresses, handfuls of other wallets for other coins, have used coinbase, gdax, bittrex, etherdelta, binance, kraken. I have played with etheroll and cryptokitties.  

This sucks.. I haven't made enough money to warrant this kind of effort.

This will probably get taken down, living on the edge https://www.ethnews.com/blockchains-llc-acquiring-over-60000-acres-in-nevada-to-showcase-blockchain-applications-yes-ethereum-no-mining?utm_content=buffer73cd3&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=bufferSo, I recently found out about GBTC, which is great if you're a BTC fan. I'm much more bullish on ETH than BTC &amp; I'm looking for a quasi-ETF like GBTC for ETH. Does anyone know of anything out there?Possibly naive question, just trying to understand why the market is reacting so strongly to this news. Any insight would be much appreciated!No one knows the future.  But there is a real possibility that this is the year the Market Cap of Etherium passes Bitcoin.

ETH seems less tied to the ups and downs of BTC as time goes on.  Furthermore, with more exchanges pairing ETH, it will eat away at BTC dominance in that way, as well.  I know I would rather trade in Ethereum pairs than Bitcoin, that is for sure.

In January, BTC has winded down from $13k to around $10k so far, whereas ETH has climbed up from $700 to over $1000 with gusto.  No one knows what is going to happen, but you can feel ETH wanting to swell, while BTC seems rather lame these days.

I know in my own portfolio, I have switched out much of my Bitcoin for Ethereum.  And my guess is this is the year that Ethereum finally surpasses the venerable giant.

So I tried to buy a little ETH earlier. Totally typical thing, I had plans for it to invest in an alt. I purchase roughly 1/3 an ETH around 2pm. Bank account transfer. It goes through, I get the email, and within 15 minutes I had transferred it to my Binance acct, and placed an ETH/AST buy.

So now, about 2 hours later, I get an email saying my coinbase buy failed, because my bank cancelled it. No idea why, since I have relatively lax security settings on that account, and it is not an out of the ordinary transaction. I also received no notice from the bank at all that something might be up.

So.... what happens now?Crypto has a very short attention span.  Everything will be back to normal in 2 days, and all the alts I bought today will be up 20%+, thereby giving me more ETH.  What a beautiful time to be alive.Tether just transferred 200M USDT - probably as a reaction to recent news? Anyway, I think it's the largest transaction I've seen so far:

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz

The [transparency page](https://wallet.tether.to/transparency) states that these tokens are *Authorized but not issued*. However they were already issued before, it seems they've just taken $200M USDT out of circulation.Hey all,

I have had a hard time getting into ICO's lately, they all seem to sell out before my order gets trough. That's why I decided to look for less hyped projects that also have amazing products (in most cases even better than these overhyped ones). I've made a shortlist of 4 projects and I'll include how much I'll be investing in them, and what I expect the profit is going to be in 2018. You may definetly check them out, but always **do your own research before investing!**


 - **The Abyss** -&gt; https://www.theabyss.com/. If you are a gaming fan, like me, you can earn money by playing the games you love + buy games a lot cheaper with this platform. The Abyss is a next generation digital distribution platform, delivering all types of video games ( including AAA-titles, to the fast-growing global game community. Unlike other platforms (Steam, Origin, GOG, etc.), The Abyss offers a groundbreaking motivational and multilevel referral system, allowing gamers to earn from in-game and social activities, and other gamers? payments as well. By joining The Abyss, developers will reduce their marketing expenses and receive an extra income from referral payments made in other games on the platform.

How much will I be investing? I will be investing 1 ETH in this project. I would have put in more but there are several gaming community platforms showing which I will also be a part of. The gaming industry is HUGE, with a revenue of over 100 billion $ annually, and I do not want to miss the boat when a crypto-based platform skyrockets.

My expectation for this project? This project has a very high chance of going x25+. If this platform takes off and becomes the standard for gamers the sky is the limit.

It is also a powerful tool to provide high quality blockchain software components to the large enterprise organizations

How much will I be investing? I will be investing between 5-10 ETH in their presale. Depending on other interesting ICO's that may cross my path before this one launches.

My expectation for this project? If any of these unknown ICO's will go x100+, it will be this one. This platform is revolutionary and will enable software developers to build apps on the blockchain easily. I'm 100% sure the blockchain is here to stay, and the demand for blockchain apps will grow with it. To have a platform where everyone, from beginners to experts, can easily develop apps on, is amazing.


 - **Current** -&gt; https://current.us/. Get paid to play all your media. Current consolidates the best content and features from the most popular media networks into an all-in-one, personalized experience. The best part? Stream your favorite content through the Current Platform and earn tokens while doing so. 

How much will I be investing? I will be investing 1 ETH in their presale. 

My expectation for this project? My expectations for this project are very high (atleast 10x). They already have a fully working platform with over 200k active users, and the project is backed by Mark Cuban. The amount of people watching streams and other content has been increasing exponentially over the past years and will keep on growing, I expect Current to take advantage of this growth, which makes the token grow aswell.


 - **Vitreus** -&gt; https://vitreus.io. Vitreus will track the origin of diamonds and other luxury items via the blockchain. I think this is the perfect usecase for a blockchain,

THE PROBLEM
The problem they will tackle is blood diamonds and insurance fraud. With the help of the blockchain, you can look back at the history of an asset and verify it's provenance

THE SOLUTION
By introducing the blockchain you have a paperless trail and certification for luxury items such as diamonds, or even pieces of art. You can't fake the origin on the blockchain.

How much will I be investing? 2 ETH, I like the project a lot

What are my expectations for this project? Very good. The limited tokens supply @200M means the price can go up. A lot. Plus the softcap is very reachable. This is not one of those icos which expects hundreds of millions of dollars.


These are some, but definetly not all of the ICO's I will be investing in this quarter. I'm always searching for more promising projects to do some research on and I have seen plenty of gems cross these forums. So if you are aware of any upcoming projects that have been flying under the radar, please let me know!What the hell is wrong with people thinking that USDT will crash all the markets? Do you even crypto? This event should be totally the oppositte, right now the price of any coin should be like 2x in USDT with the recent FUD because everybody would rather have their money in any coin instead of USDT, all of you guys crying and selling right now are just making things easier for people to exit USDT...

Imagine the worst case scenario, USDT is proved to be a scam, the price of USDT will go to hell leaving their holders with zero money, but only USDT holders will be affected as nobody would want to trade their crypto for USDT, why would other cryptos have to go down? That's just bullshit...

You should only be afraid of this event if you hold any USDT, if not, you should be totally fine.Based upon my opinion as a lawyer (not giving legal advice), and someone who has overseen corporate compliance audits for major corporations in conjunction with top accounting firms, I just want to point out (like I said awhile ago when the Tether stuff restarted) that the lack of release of the audit reports on Tether were probably due to two factors (and not an empty Tether bank account):

1) **Ongoing audit**. The auditor wouldn't allow a release of the report/preliminary findings because it hadn't finished the audit. They can see the cash in the accounts, but likely wanted to audit way more (e.g., other pairs and also relevant POEs to make sure no other fraud was occuring). This is standard practice, and gets super frustrating--no audit is ever done when you want it to be. This is also why Friedman dumped them--Tether tried to leak a preliminary report that showed the USD in the accounts w/out the audit being completed. Probably also got spooked by the CFTC review and went into auditing overdrive.

2) **Ongoing regulatory investigation**. I thought that Bitfinex was likely under investigation by the CFTC or SEC weeks ago. This explains why they simply couldn't release an audit report or documentation of their accounts. They have to comply with the investigation, and their lawyers are telling them to sit still and don't do anything that could be construed as interference (leaking financial stability information to the public definitely could result in enhanced charges/penalties if the CFTC finds some other compliance issue).

So, IMO, Tether is likely solvent but the CFTC is digging deeper. You can bet if they had an empty Tether bank account, the CFTC would have shut down this shitshow back in December.This is the first time I'm sending some ETH out of MEW. How much gas should I include to send 1 ETH? Don't want to mess up the transaction. 

Thanks! I'd like to propose the addition of either 1) a weekly pinned thread to r/ethereum or r/ethtrader or 2) a new subreddit for the non-technical/non-developers in the community. I suspect there is a growing number of interested people with general business backgrounds (finance, operations, marketing, etc.), like myself, who are intellectually and financially invested in Ethereum. I think it would be great to have a dedicated avenue to discuss, collaborate, and network with peers on ideas for dapps, marketing, etc. This would provide a thought medium for more diverse backgrounds and skillsets than is generally available in r/ethereum. It could help bridge the gap between those who lack development backgrounds with those in the technical community. Merging non-technical folks with the technical folks would propagate sharing of ideas for dapps and decentralized workflows while providing clarity to real world feasibility and technological implications of proposed ideas. Thanks!

***I tried posting this in r/ethereum yesterday, but the bot kicked it for being a discussion that should be included in r/ethtrader. I messaged the mods to advise, but have not received a response.Hello guys, I just want to tell my story, hope you don't mind.

on the 10th of Jan I had 2.14129 on my trading acc on Kraken... and I had open LONG positions on EUR and USD pairs...

when the Korea FUD started I decided to flip my positions and go SHORT down to 10 000$.... I flipped my EUR position, I sold all of my own bitcoin, but before I could flip my USD position the site went DOWN...

WITH NO WARNING !!!! the only announcement was on https://status.kraken.com.... who the feck keeps an eye on that ?? no email... no announcement on the website it self...

so my USD LONG position staid open...

now I think you already know the terribly unprofessional and criminal way the Kraken handled the update... you can see the details here: np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7qcj9u/why_kraken_is_an_unsafebad_exchange_and_why_you/ and here: https://status.kraken.com/incidents/nswthr1lyx72

after 2 days of down time when I managed to log in to my acc the situation was a mess... I was under on both my positions so I decided to minimize the losses/risk and I started closing some of my positions both long and short... I wish I could post my trades but some of my trades are missing from the "history" on Kraken website... the bug trades are not there anymore... (I do have the "screenshots")

anyway first few trades went in normally and my acc had about 1.8BTC left... and than on the 15th of JAN the BUG hit me...!!! instead of losing 200 closing short position I lost 24.82 and 0.53989 BTC at this stage I was left with 1.3 BTC and I was unable to close any of my positions because of the danger the BUG will take it all...

so I contacted Kraken support Ticket #1369001... my ticket was "upgraded" the same day... and Kraken customer support Jochen and Robert contacted me by email... saying pretty much: "yeah... there is a BUG... we are working on it..." and nothing else...

and at the time my only question was: "WHAT DO I DO WITH MY OPEN POSITIONS !!!????"... no replay... I sent numerous emails... no replay... I wasn't even asking when will I get my 0.53989 BTC back... I just wanted to KNOW... WHAT DO I DO with my positions...??? NO REPLAY...

and I didn't get a replay until today... 15 DAYS LATER !!!! Hello Ozzak, Our Team is still working on restoring all balances, we are in the process to document and calculate all affected positions by this. I'll update you shortly, sorry for the delay. The bug is resolved and you can close positions without issues. Best Regards, Jochen Kraken Client Engagement

so NOW he tells me its SAFE to close my position fucking 15 days later. and my acc looks like this at the moment (I already closed some of the positions not to get liquidated) Profit/Loss -6,568.71 (-33.91%) Paper profit/loss of all open positions. Trade Balances Trade Balance 9,839.38 Total margin currency balance. Equity 3,270.67 Trade balance combined with unrealized profit/loss. Used Margin 3,873.09 Total margin amount used in open positions. Free Margin -602.42 Usable margin balance. Equal to equity minus used margin. Margin Level 84.4% Percentage ratio of equity to used margin.

so my Equity is at 3,270.67 or ~0.3 BTC.... because of unprofessional and criminal behavior of Kraken I went from 2.1 BTC to 0.3 BTC... WTF ???

and not only that... but they restored margin trading for other customers like nothing has happened.... they even started charging me rollover fee yesterday... :/

how hes telling me Ill be refunded? For what ?? will it only be the part that BUG took ?? or the whole amount for positions I couldnt close because of you??? when will I be reimbursed ?

I was right about bitcoin crashing and I was meant to make a very nice profit going down and now my whole trading acc is practically gone because the bastards couldnt answer one simple question

so I guess my question now is: now when Kraken finally confirmed that its safe to close the position will I be reimbursed for the losses I take closing this position today? Will I be reimbursed for the positions I already closed...? Will I be reimbursed for the BTC bug took? And when will it happened?

WHERE IS MY MONEY ???

/u/kraken-tyler, /u/jespow, /u/kraken-jpj - do I have to wait for another 15 days to get a replay now...?

ps. oh... and I have all the emails and screenshots if need be...

The following is for Tether tokens on the Ethereum blockchain only.   
The Omni/Bitcoin blockchain Tether tokens function differently.          
Looking through their [smart contract source](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code) on lines 264 through 299 are the blacklist and destroy functions.     
I have excerpted these lines in this [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/LADR4K1V).   
    
**Summary**       
Tether is able to unilaterally blacklist any Ethereum address.    
Doing so labels the user as evilUser and all their Tether tokens are designated as dirtyFunds.     
Once a user is blacklisted the destroyBlackFunds function can be used on their Tether token balances.         
This sets their Tether token balances to 0 and decreases the total supply for the affected Tether tokens.           
             
 **Possible Consequences**      
Aside from the obvious of being at the complete mercy of Tether, this leaves them open to potentially catastrophic incidents and coercion from governments and other entities.       
Someone who gains access to the smart contract functions could blacklist all token holder addresses and then destroy all Ethereum Tether tokens.    
Tether could say they will comply with all legitimate government orders and blacklist and destroy the funds of anyone a government requests.      
   
**As a potential model for authoritarian governments**   
Cash is difficult to control.     
How much easier it would be for a government to have centralized control over all of their citizens' net worth of legal currency.     
First a warning is given.       
After so many offenses or for whatever reason, the citizen's government issued address is blacklisted, temporarily or permanently.   
Their funds destroyed, or not.            
This would cut them off from rest of the national economy, except for those who'd risk becoming blacklisted as well.  
This has all the makings of a Black Mirror episode.             
   
**Plea**  
Please, don't support this model.    
Don't let think anyone think this is acceptable.   The possible start of a Bitcoin bear market and how Ethereum may react to that. Bitcoin cash remaining within a small consolidation along with Cardano within its longer term consolidation. And a look at Neo and what its up to.

https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@matthew-analysis/daily-crypto-analysis-30th-jan-technical-analysisIt's common knowledge that the safest place to store cash is in an FDIC-insured savings account.  Knowing that - and assuming secure 2FA is being used - how is it so much riskier to store funds in an FDIC-insured Coinbase account?

Using only a hardware wallet could even be more unsafe because then there is no safety net.  There are far more, "I lost all my ETH because I made a stupid mistake" posts involving losing or overwriting private keys than there are, "I lost all my ETH because [insert hypothetical scenario involving bankruptcy or a rogue employee]" posts.

Do you keep all of your cash under your mattress as well?  How can you trust a bank with your hard-earned money?

Maybe I am missing something.The guts of it will hit by March 15 (meaning true flirtation, hovering around 75% of Btcs market cap). Expect full flip by April 1. It will take about a week or two for the average investor to fully grasp the ramifications, after which Eth will go on a massive bull run. By the end of the summer, I expect Eths market cap to be around $250b and Btc to sit around $100-150b. Set your reminders. I have contacted Coinbase support many times and have gotten no real answer. My identity has been confirmed. I have been using it for years. I have tried other exchange sites but they don't support my location (Washington State). Has anyone had a similar experience?Anyone out there holding ICN, and their thoughts. 

I find that there isnt a proper forum to discuss this Ethereum based token. 

Every time something like this happens, there's less chance it happens again (as the market, theoretically, will mature). Couple that with all the good news to come; adoption, scaling solutions, POS, and you have a recipe for success. 



As more and more people see crypto survive the storms, and it become more and more a part of their daily lives (as opposed to the odd Bloomberg article and internet banner ad) they *will* feel more comfortable investing, and the prise will rise.



How much will ETH be worth in 12 months? I don't know, and I don't think anyone does. What I do know is this: there's a very good chance that the future is **very** bright for ETH/Ethereum, and if you're interested in investing in the cryptosphere, you could do a lot worse than to park your $ here.



As always, only invest what you can lose, crypto *is* risky - but you take on that risk because you want 5x-10x+ returns. Have fun out there. If there is a better sub to have this discussion, please direct me to it 

Basically, I use MetaMask to buy and sell minor coins with Ethereum as my buffer. Just buy ethereum via Coinbase, send it to my MetaMask, and buy smaller coins through MetaMask. However, today MetaMask updated, and I was able to use my secret code words to link my account back up to it, but none of my coins are there. It still shows me as having some ETH left over that I used for gas, but my transaction history and ~$150 worth of minor cryptos are gone. Is there anything I can do to solve this problem?It seems coinbase doesn't accept my Skrill card, or the other way around.

Are there any exchangers I can use to buy ETH using Skrill?Our indie game studio RareSloth will be using Ethereum for our next game; King Rabbit - Furever. We believe in the Ethereum technology and think it will open up new opportunities that improve the customer experience. If you're interested in the details you can visit [our website](http://www.raresloth.com). 

We're excited to be on the cutting edge of this technology, we can't wait to see how things pan out. Feel free to ask questions!https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/crypto-exchange-bitfinex-tether-said-to-get-subpoenaed-by-cftc

Based on the technology changes coming, the timing of taxes, and the general previous behavior of bull-runs, I think we'll see the next bull run in early May or June, to price levels of $4,000 or greater.

We just had an awesome bull-run and now we're in a bit of a cool-down period. Taxes are being figured out, and technology is being improved. Price-wise I think the result is that we're in a necessary slowdown period, and it will stay that way for another 3-5 months.

Once the technology improvements are realized, adoption increases, and people feel more comfortable to start making speculative investment spending we'll see a new bull run. I don't think it will be as aggressive as a 10x on pricing that we see from spring of 2017, but I'm betting a 4-7x is likely.

This is all pure speculation based on how I view the state of the Ethereum universe right now.Starting off by saying nothing but love for the MEW team; I just wanted to have a thought exercise. 

Is it possible for them or a malware program to:

Transfer eth to a different address than the one that is displayed on your ledger when confirming? 

Transfer a different amount of eth than the amount displayed on the ledger? 

Change the text of your signed transactions after you sign, altering the amount or address? 

I think everyone already knows that very soon the start of the project will be launched and I'm sure that it will end in an instant. Who believes in him and is ready to invest all his virtual savings, and who else has doubts, and he uses only a small part? Personally, I still have some doubts, but I will still take part in it. The future is not known to us, and white paper is written very beautifully!What we have works. We have a secure system that becomes more and more expensive every day to try to hack. We also have a hardware community which is dumping capital into supporting this blockchain which has the ability to disrupt (and improve!) trillions of dollars of commerce globally. That is huge.

We also have a very real problem. And that problem is scaling. We have ~75B of ICOs which will bring their apps online this year. Those apps are being written by incredibly talented teams who are going to bring wonderful products to market. And those apps are going to be very demanding on the Ethereum network.

In order for Ethereum to succeed, the focus right NOW needs to be scaling. Yes, PoS can have scaling, but so can PoW. And PoW currently WORKS.

If we do not get scaling in place this year, Ethereum will fail. And if Ethereum fails, it is very possible that confidence in crypto-currency in general falters.

My opinion is not popular. Every 3 posts I see on this subreddit are people asking for PoS. I find that to be wildly irresponsible. PoS is going to be very difficult to implement. It will take time. And during that time, if the Ethereum network is inoperable (remember cryptokitties?), developers will move elsewhere. Capital will move elsewhere. And Ethereum will die.

PoW uses energy. A lot of it. Yes. We are all acutely aware. But guess what? It is working. And maybe this is just the way it is going to be for the first 5 years or so. AND THAT IS FINE.

Why? Because I am looking at the bigger picture. I want Ethereum to be successful. I want to remove all the middlemen out there who are charging us insulting rates (I'm looking at you, Ticketmaster). I want for disruption to take place. I want to remove power from the banks and the lobbyists. And that CAN HAPPEN.

But it will not happen if we focus on and demand PoS today. WE NEED SCALING TODAY.

Yes. I fully understand that PoS is expected to have scaling. But how long will that take to put into place? Are we willing to jeopardize this global movement because people want to save energy and for their Ethereum to moon due to staking?

Ethereum will moon with adoption. Ethereum will moon with scaling. Global interest will moon if Ethereum is successful.

And then we can focus on PoS. After we have proven to the world that crypto-currencies do have a place and does bring value to the global commerce system. That is the time to focus on improving the system and reducing electricity consumption. I think that is a wonderful long term goal. But it is the wrong short term goal. The short term goal is making Ethereum successful. And that requires scaling. Which can be done today on the PoW system. Which works.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

TL/DR: We need scaling. PoS development will take too long to implement with scaling. The focus needs to be scaling on the PoW network.

Mandatory Disclaimer. I am a GPU miner. I have invested in supporting the hardware network of this ecosystem. I am being compensated by the system for doing that. I also own Ethereum and fully believe it's value will increase with adoption and use of the currency.[Snake flip](https://www.ethwork.net/snake.html), called so because the experiment consists of a string of tokens that gets longer, is a social experiment in a smart contract where all but the last participants gain (real) ETH as long as Ethereum exists. How is this possible? This is how it works ([read smart contract here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x01dd8186b8f38dfa01ea2c044355ea95206a4481)):


First there is only one token, the snake head. This token can be bought for .01 ETH using Metamask. Every time someone buys a token, the price of that token increases 50% (making it 150% of the previous price). The next buyer can thus buy the head token for .015 ETH. The original buyer will receive his original investment + 25% gain:  .0125 ETH (and yes, I get the remnant). 


Every time the head-token is traded, a new token is added to the tail, increasing the length of the snake. The initial owner of this new token is the last buyer of the head-token. The tail tokens are a safer investment because they should be cheaper to trade than the head token and have more promise to sell again until they reach the price of the head-token. You can own multiple tokens at the same time, all of which will earn you 25% profit when sold.


At first, investments and gains are small, but as the tokens get traded they increase in price. If a token is worth 1 ETH and you buy it, you will gain 1.25 ETH if it is sold. If a token is worth 50 ETH and you buy it , you will gain 62.5 ETH if it is sold. 


Of course there is a risk, namely that your token never gets sold. But since the smart contract does not have a selfdestruct (nor a withdraw) function, it will exist as long as Ethereum exists, so youll have forever to sell your token; and your gain will always be 125% of your investment.


[Try it here!](https://www.ethwork.net/snake.html) Early participants have a near 100% chance of profit! 


Q: Isnt this a Ponzi scheme? 
Kind of, however traditional Ponzi schemes have an element of deceit in them, whereas this experiment does not.


Q: Is this an ICO?
No, just a 30 minutes smart contract.


PS. to see if a token you own sold, check the etherscan page for your metamask account. the internal transactions tab. ETH transactions sent from a smart contract to you do not show up in your Metamask history afaik.
It's a 2013 Model S 85. Gray exterior, beige interior. 45,000 miles. It has the tech package, free supercharging, and brand new tires.

I'm in the US. If you're close enough we can meet somewhere, if not I can ship it.

The dealer offered me $40k. I'm thinking I should take no less than 40 ETH, maybe more seeing how there's potential for a price drop and I'll need the fiat equivalent sooner rather than later so hodling might not be possible.

What do you all think? What's a fair price in ETH for a vehicle with a trade-in value of $40k?

Personally, I believe the flippening will eventually happen. But people here are being to pessimistic towards bitcoin, and I'm not saying they should appreciate it because it is a good currency, I don't believe that myself. I'm saying bitcoin is prime brand recognition. 2018 will be the biggest year for crypto yet, the year the masses flood in. The year crypto becomes mainstream. And if you want to play it safe with your investments, what do you do? Of course you buy BTC because you don't even know of anything else. This is going to be a very good year for ETH, but it is also going to be a good year for BTC, and I would not expect the flippening to happen this year at all. Maybe 19? Maybe 20? It's inevitable, but not this soon.So we know Goldman Sachs is planning a cryptocurrency trading desk: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-21/goldman-is-said-to-be-building-a-cryptocurrency-trading-desk

Now something interesting I've also noticed, is that The Ocean X, powered by 0x, has an interesting team: https://theoceanx.com/team/

If you look at the 3rd person, John Piotrowski, and check his LinkedIn page, you'll notice he is currently Vice President at Goldman Sachs, Finance Division, Capital Analysis: https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnpiotrowskiuva/

It also shows him doing "Business Development" for The Ocean X for the past couple of months. Yeah sure, going from Vice President at Goldman Sachs to Biz Dev guy for some startup while maintaining current status for both positions sounds like a totally natural career move. /s

The Bloomberg article says Goldman is "assembling a team in New York". The Ocean X now looking for a "Community Director" in New York, NY? - https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/community-director-for-blockchain-startup-at-the-ocean-x-580841512/

I wonder who else in the 0x ecosystem has ties to Goldman Sachs? Oh right, the co-founder of Coinbase, Fred Ehrsam, who now advises for 0x, was previously with Goldman Sachs: https://0xproject.com/about

We know Goldman Sachs owns the SETLCoin patent, maybe they want to use 0x to connect SETL to other assets? - https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-07-17/goldman-wins-patent-setlcoin-technology

Another thing, on TheOceanX.com homepage, they say "Our mission is to build the worlds largest, deepest, and best supported token liquidity pool." Key words being "liquidity pool". Goldman Sachs' liquidity pools are called "Sigma X". - http://www.goldmansachs.com/what-we-do/securities/gset/equities/liquidity-access/ Any coincidence The 0cean recently rebranded to The Ocean X? - https://medium.com/@theoceanx/we-changed-our-name-slightly-4cd72bf4d386

Funny sidenote, their Sigma X platform executes orders using an NBBO they nick-named "Ocean".Dont be like me. Dont fall for the hype of making a quick dollar off these coins and their promises of "mooonnn" bullshit. Ethereum is the truth and the future. I sold a shit of my ETH and dabbled into this hype only to get burned on pump and dumps everywhere. Man, fuck it, I'm rebuying at a loss and never selling out again. Im sorry ETH, please take me back.  Could be time-sensitive stuff, as well. Not just long-term things. I'm more inclined to work on short-term stuff.

I'm a Stanford student trying to build things that are actually useful or cool to crypto enthusiasts, as a way to ethically make some personal capital short-term (no I don't want to do a fucking ICO).

My experience/skills are in building products -- mobile apps, websites, other coding, etc.

Ethereum dapps look really cool, and pretty easy to setup. I was really inspired looking through the source code of CryptoKitties -- kinda stupid but genius at the same time.

Anyone have ideas for either useful or fun smart contract ideas?A lot already believe this will be the year of eth. Scaling is the biggest concern.

The Tether FUD is overblown and doesn't make much sense. The entire basis of the Tether FUD comes from a random anonymous Twitter account, Bitfinexed, that seemed to have a personal vendetta on Bitfinex...
https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@kjnk/why-the-tether-fud-doesn-t-make-sense-and-we-are-getting-manipulatedAm I right in assuming that the flippening is most likely going to be caused by Bitcoin's market cap lowering and meeting Ether's somewhere in the middle rather than Ether's market cap just straight up catching and overtaking it?Front running is becoming a major cause of mistrust in the cryto community. Most of the orders placed in the exchange are manipulated and we end up paying higher fee. This needs to stop and exchanges have to be more clear with their operations.The original version works just fine and is honestly genius. Dividends are paid in ETH and are still strong and for some reason the price is the ONLY price stable coin right now. For some reason all this Tether thing did not really effect this 3 days old coin and the price is rock solid. https://powhcoin.com

Well enough shilling (had to make a clear distinction), now to the bad news. The dev made a clone that includes more fees (and has fees when you sell and not only for buying). After a few hours it had almost as much ETH as the original in the contract but now a bug in the shadow contract (not the original one!) made all ETH in this clone stuck forever. https://powhcoin.com/shadowfork.html

Let this be a lession for you guys. Smart contracts can have errors and every change to it, no matter how small, can fuck everything up.So...  I got an email saying an unrecognized device had logged in to my HitBTC account.  Nice of them to notify me, except that I never signed up for one, so this made me nervous.  First, I assumed the link was just a scam, so I didn't click it.  I hovered over it, it looked weird, so I just went directly to www.hitbtc.com and typed in my email and clicked password reset.  If I have no account, that shouldn't work, problem solved.  Well, it did work, sort of.  They sent me a password reset link, and my stomach sank a bit, thinking... fuck, my identity has been stolen.   

Next, I reset the password to a unique difficult password because I'm still skeptical.  All good.
Then when I go to sign in with that password, it says...   "THANK YOU FOR SIGNING UP" and that they had sent me a confirmation email.


So... is this how hitbtc is getting people to sign up?  I mean, they don't have anything besides my email and a bogus password, so...   what the hell just happened, any ideas?Hi there, anyone can provide a link to a tutorial for writing your own trading bot on, say, gdax for example?

Language doesn't matter,  I'm a software dev so I can pick up any language easily. What I need is basically an api tutorial, maybe even an example of how to write a simple bot and how to run it.

I'd like a tutorial that walks you through writing one from scratch, not one that makes you download a bunch of frameworks and you just tweak the bot performance. Any hints welcome!Wow!

Of course, this question is asked a trillion times before, but imma do it anyway.

You see what happened with BTC, ETH, NEO etc, some big boys who climbed the markets to high heights. Now my question is; why did these coins actualy got their value? And please dont just answer as Offer - Demand :).

My next question; what are you hodling now and what would you suggest in buyin in before it is too late! But most important, WHY are you hodling, why you think it would increase in value significantly? (Mostly looking for -$50 coins)

Thank you in advance!Announcing the SWM Airdrop. Everyone who registers on the Swarm platform this week (until 4 Feb) will receive an Airdrop of 100 SWM tokens in their wallet. #SWM https://swarm.fund Tokens will be airdropped within two weeks of the end of the promotion (by 18 Feb). Get to it!Hi, I have my app released in beta format. Im looking for people who would be interested in using an app that posts breaking news such as tweets, reddit info and news from other sources that can affect us crypto day traders.  

The app allows any and all users to also submit news which is immediately peer reviewed and pushed to the full audience if approved. This allows us to create a large network of well informed people we can pool information from and help everyone stay ahead of the game. 

If you're interested we need android beta testers right now, the iphone version is done and will be needing beta testers for that soon to if youd like to message me about that, but android first.

If youd like to be part of the project in other ways you can message me regarding that also.

Thanks guys. 

Also feature suggestions that can help day traders are always welcomed.https://gfycat.com/defenselessmiserableiberianbarbel

Someone else posted this here, I thought it was appropriate to resurrect.Vitalik Buterin is 24 years old today, and even though I'm about a decade older than him, I really look up to and admire him. He has dedicating himself to a cause that is so much bigger than himself or any of us. There aren't many 24-year-olds who would do that, especially if they had the kind of money he has. He isn't in this for the money. He wants to help people and make the world a better place. I believe Ethereum is going to change the world. It will lead to a tremendous amount of economic growth and provide incredible opportunities for everyone, including the very poorest on the earth. All of us, as investors, are very fortunate to have Vitalik as a visionary/thought leader. I'm indebted to him for how this investment has changed my life. Long live Vitalik! Thank you and happy birthday!Posted this to /r/BitcoinCA as well, but figured I'd spread the word to warn ETH buyers too

You can search reddit for "Kraken CAD wire" and you'll get many threads of people with issues varying from long wait times, ignored tickets, and surprise fees when the funds finally go through

I wish I had done this search prior to sending them money. I used them over a year ago when they still had EFT as an option and I naively thought that things would be more or less the same. I am still here waiting for my funds to get to my account despite the money being taken from my bank three weeks ago. Sent a ticket and escalated it twice now, still nothing

Don't make the same mistake I didThat sounds shitty and I know, Im not even a decentralize everything in the world or libertarian  fanatic type of guy, I had a lot invested at ripple at one time and it wouldve been better for me if it mooned.

But holy Fuck the community surrounding it and downing on ethereum and talking about how its shit and all of ethtrader is fucking stupid, especially when it passed market cap. it got me really pissed. They were all flaunting around like they were a bunch of geniuses and then it tanked and Im honestly happy about it, even if it made me lose some money its a great feeling.

Sorry for the random post but really thoughIf 1 million people each invest on average $100 in crytpo that is $100 million USD flowing in. What is the real life impact on marketcaps?  Far greater than just a $100 million dollar marketcap gain spread out right?  Any economics specialists want to chime in?BTC just dropped below $10k and if you look at charts on flippening.watch you see ETH's marketcap is slowly creeping up to BTCs (62% currently but only 33% on January 1st) and the flippening might happen soon. The market cap difference in percentage has been as high as 83% in June of 2017 but then both coins were still up and coming and now BTC seems in decline. The ETH/BTC trading pair has also been mostly positive during the various dips the past few weeks. 

At what flipping point (e.g., 80%) BTC traders will become aware that the flippening is imminent and then trade their BTC for ETHs which will then further exacerbate the flippening? ETH dethroning BTC as largest crypto will likely get more people to invest in ETH and the difference in market caps will expand very quickly if a flippening happens, I assume. This is kind of a strange event that has not really happened before (BCH never overtook BTC). Its all speculation at this point but would like to hear your ideas/ opinions.Welcome to the Daily Altcoin Discussion thread of /r/EthTrader.

Everything he does and how he talks about crypto is everything I hate about this space. He doesnt read crypto, he buys in presales for massive discounts then uses his platform to shamelessly promote projects he really doesnt understand. This is how people will get hurt. its gotten to the point where the "conventional wisdom" among crypto retail investors is to adamantly hodl. that basically means there is a floor. that floor is also the greater fool. sad to say, when things go wrong, hodlers will be the greater fool left holding the bag.

if Bitcoin prices are revealed to be elevated by tether which is NOT backed by $2.3 Billion of USD fiat, [as Roubini suggests](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-bitfinex-tether-are-raising-nagging-questions-in-the-cryptocurrency-market-2018-01-30), this would imply that tethers can be created out of thin air, and the demand for bitcoin indicated by its market price is not "real,"  and therefore the asset could be overvalued. 

Then again, $2.3 Billion USD is not an unthinkably large sum in crypto land. 
It is 1.366% of Bitcoin's current market cap. 

&gt; If traders lose faith in tether, they could end up triggering the crypto version of a bank run. Tether helps stabilize cryptocurrency exchanges in various ways, so its collapse could also cause some exchanges to topple, wiping out billions of dollars of investments overnight and potentially undoing much of the publics growing interest in new technologies like bitcoin.
[Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/why-tethers-collapse-would-be-bad-for-cryptocurrencies/) 

This is where hodlers come into play once again. hodlers add stability to every part of the crypto ecosystem they are part of. 

&gt; In lieu of an audit, Tether released a document in September purporting to substantiate its reserves, but with the names of its banking partners blacked out. Since that time, the number of tethers in circulation has risen roughly five-fold, to 2.28 billion, from 450 million. In January alone Tether has released 850 million new tethers.

(Same Wired article)

How do new Tether enter circulation? 
One possibility is market participants demand tether(either directly or through Bitfinex), and provide USD to Tether. Tether hodls those USD in reserve at its banks, and provides Tether 1-for-1 to the market participants. 

Another possibility is Tether "prints" tether, and funnels them into Bitfinex, which is controlled by the same team that controls Tether. To enter circulation, tether must be exchanged for another token, and it appears it has been largely used to purchase Bitcoin since September. 

In this case, Tether has been hodling Bitcoin instead of hodling USD, and its hodlings are likely worth more than the $2.3 Billion USD, at current prices. This affords some insurance while times are good, but as they say, insurance only counts when things go wrong.  

And as the article states, this is a house of cards. The CFTC is investigating. Regardless of if Tether's current hodlings exceed $2.3 Billion USD in value, it would likely be charged with fraud. If this scenario is true, the value of its Bitcoin hodlings would also fall, likely below $2.3 Bn in value. AKA ponzi scheme. 

The next domino mentioned in the Wired article is that tether is used by traders and exchanges for cashing out and for facilitating trades between cryptocurrencies. If tether is eliminated, would another currency be a good substitute? 
How about Ripple? 

Doomsday seems to require the fraud charge, Tether going underwater (value of holdings under $2.3 Bn), and there being no substitute for tether in facilitating trades. 

I can easily see the fraud charge, and a further 20-30% drop in Bitcoin and other cryptos. And that may or may not cause Tether to go underwater. But I do believe "tether" can be replaced as a medium of exchange. 

I also believe the conventional wisdom "the way to win in crypto is to hodl" is extremely powerful in English speaking countries. I'm interested to learn if Hodl is as powerful a mantra in Asia. Assuming it is, hodling is its own self fulfilling prophecy during the age of the retail crypto investor.

Another discussion question: are we still in the age of the retail crypto investor? In my view, once the market becomes more heavily institutionalized, which it will very quickly due to tax reforms, "Hodl"
won't work anymore, and the last people calling themselves hodlers will be like Hodor in his final scene in GOT, desperately hodling the door while institutional investors escape into the night. 

please share your thoughts on any and all of the above in the comments below! 

When ETH overtakes BTC in a month or two how smooth of a transition will it be?  How will it affect other alts?  Will exchanges pair to ETH on everything before the actual flippening?  Or only after.  Thoughts?https://www.ethnews.com/blockchains-llc-acquiring-over-60000-acres-in-nevada-to-showcase-blockchain-applications-yes-ethereum-no-mining?utm_content=buffer73cd3&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=bufferSo, I recently found out about GBTC, which is great if you're a BTC fan. I'm much more bullish on ETH than BTC &amp; I'm looking for a quasi-ETF like GBTC for ETH. Does anyone know of anything out there?Possibly naive question, just trying to understand why the market is reacting so strongly to this news. Any insight would be much appreciated!

Edit:  I'm referring to what Nouriel Roubini said: 

"Renowned economics professor Nouriel Roubini (commonly known as Dr. Doom) has called out Tether today for being a scam meant to artificially prop up the price of bitcoin. He thinks that without this criminal manipulation the price of bitcoin would crash by 80% and that American financial markets regulators are failing to stop this fraud.

Roubini tweeted that: Regulators asleep at the wheel while $2 billion of fake $ created via this scam, half of it since December. Not even North Korea created so many fake $ backed by nothing. And in a separate tweet he added: Regulators are just looking and doing little so far while swindlers, charlatans, scammers, criminals, carnival barkers are in full action in the crypto-universe."No one knows the future.  But there is a real possibility that this is the year the Market Cap of Etherium passes Bitcoin.

ETH seems less tied to the ups and downs of BTC as time goes on.  Furthermore, with more exchanges pairing ETH, it will eat away at BTC dominance in that way, as well.  I know I would rather trade in Ethereum pairs than Bitcoin, that is for sure.

In January, BTC has winded down from $13k to around $10k so far, whereas ETH has climbed up from $700 to over $1000 with gusto.  No one knows what is going to happen, but you can feel ETH wanting to swell, while BTC seems rather lame these days.

I know in my own portfolio, I have switched out much of my Bitcoin for Ethereum.  And my guess is this is the year that Ethereum finally surpasses the venerable giant.

So I tried to buy a little ETH earlier. Totally typical thing, I had plans for it to invest in an alt. I purchase roughly 1/3 an ETH around 2pm. Bank account transfer. It goes through, I get the email, and within 15 minutes I had transferred it to my Binance acct, and placed an ETH/AST buy.

So now, about 2 hours later, I get an email saying my coinbase buy failed, because my bank cancelled it. No idea why, since I have relatively lax security settings on that account, and it is not an out of the ordinary transaction. I also received no notice from the bank at all that something might be up.

So.... what happens now?Tether just transferred 200M USDT - probably as a reaction to recent news? Anyway, I think it's the largest transaction I've seen so far:

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz

The [transparency page](https://wallet.tether.to/transparency) states that these tokens are *Authorized but not issued*. However they were already issued before, it seems they've just taken $200M USDT out of circulation.Hey all,

I have had a hard time getting into ICO's lately, they all seem to sell out before my order gets trough. That's why I decided to look for less hyped projects that also have amazing products (in most cases even better than these overhyped ones). I've made a shortlist of 4 projects and I'll include how much I'll be investing in them, and what I expect the profit is going to be in 2018. You may definetly check them out, but always **do your own research before investing!**


 - **The Abyss** -&gt; https://www.theabyss.com/. If you are a gaming fan, like me, you can earn money by playing the games you love + buy games a lot cheaper with this platform. The Abyss is a next generation digital distribution platform, delivering all types of video games ( including AAA-titles, to the fast-growing global game community. Unlike other platforms (Steam, Origin, GOG, etc.), The Abyss offers a groundbreaking motivational and multilevel referral system, allowing gamers to earn from in-game and social activities, and other gamers? payments as well. By joining The Abyss, developers will reduce their marketing expenses and receive an extra income from referral payments made in other games on the platform.

How much will I be investing? I will be investing 1 ETH in this project. I would have put in more but there are several gaming community platforms showing which I will also be a part of. The gaming industry is HUGE, with a revenue of over 100 billion $ annually, and I do not want to miss the boat when a crypto-based platform skyrockets.

My expectation for this project? This project has a very high chance of going x25+. If this platform takes off and becomes the standard for gamers the sky is the limit.


 - **Squeezer** -&gt; https://squeezer.io/. The world's first software development platform that's blockchain oriented. Squeezer is a platform that helps software developers to build apps easily without tackling the entire blockchain infrastructure . It is also a powerful tool to provide high quality blockchain software components to the large enterprise organizations

How much will I be investing? I will be investing between 5-10 ETH in their presale. Depending on other interesting ICO's that may cross my path before this one launches.

My expectation for this project? If any of these unknown ICO's will go x100+, it will be this one. This platform is revolutionary and will enable software developers to build apps on the blockchain easily. I'm 100% sure the blockchain is here to stay, and the demand for blockchain apps will grow with it. To have a platform where everyone, from beginners to experts, can easily develop apps on, is amazing.


 - **Current** -&gt; https://current.us/. Get paid to play all your media. Current consolidates the best content and features from the most popular media networks into an all-in-one, personalized experience. The best part? Stream your favorite content through the Current Platform and earn tokens while doing so. 

How much will I be investing? I will be investing 1 ETH in their presale. 

My expectation for this project? My expectations for this project are very high (atleast 10x). They already have a fully working platform with over 200k active users, and the project is backed by Mark Cuban. The amount of people watching streams and other content has been increasing exponentially over the past years and will keep on growing, I expect Current to take advantage of this growth, which makes the token grow aswell.


 - **Vitreus** -&gt; https://vitreus.io. Vitreus will track the origin of diamonds and other luxury items via the blockchain. I think this is the perfect usecase for a blockchain,

THE PROBLEM
The problem they will tackle is blood diamonds and insurance fraud. With the help of the blockchain, you can look back at the history of an asset and verify it's provenance

THE SOLUTION
By introducing the blockchain you have a paperless trail and certification for luxury items such as diamonds, or even pieces of art. You can't fake the origin on the blockchain.

How much will I be investing? 2 ETH, I like the project a lot

What are my expectations for this project? Very good. The limited tokens supply @200M means the price can go up. A lot. Plus the softcap is very reachable. This is not one of those icos which expects hundreds of millions of dollars.


These are some, but definetly not all of the ICO's I will be investing in this quarter. I'm always searching for more promising projects to do some research on and I have seen plenty of gems cross these forums. So if you are aware of any upcoming projects that have been flying under the radar, please let me know!What the hell is wrong with people thinking that USDT will crash all the markets? Do you even crypto? This event should be totally the oppositte, right now the price of any coin should be like 2x in USDT with the recent FUD because everybody would rather have their money in any coin instead of USDT, all of you guys crying and selling right now are just making things easier for people to exit USDT...

Imagine the worst case scenario, USDT is proved to be a scam, the price of USDT will go to hell leaving their holders with zero money, but only USDT holders will be affected as nobody would want to trade their crypto for USDT, why would other cryptos have to go down? That's just bullshit...

You should only be afraid of this event if you hold any USDT, if not, you should be totally fine.Based upon my opinion as a lawyer (not giving legal advice), and someone who has overseen corporate compliance audits for major corporations in conjunction with top accounting firms, I just want to point out (like I said awhile ago when the Tether stuff restarted) that the lack of release of the audit reports on Tether were probably due to two factors (and not an empty Tether bank account):

1) **Ongoing audit**. The auditor wouldn't allow a release of the report/preliminary findings because it hadn't finished the audit. They can see the cash in the accounts, but likely wanted to audit way more (e.g., other pairs and also relevant POEs to make sure no other fraud was occuring). This is standard practice, and gets super frustrating--no audit is ever done when you want it to be. This is also why Friedman dumped them--Tether tried to leak a preliminary report that showed the USD in the accounts w/out the audit being completed. Probably also got spooked by the CFTC review and went into auditing overdrive.

2) **Ongoing regulatory investigation**. I thought that Bitfinex was likely under investigation by the CFTC or SEC weeks ago. This explains why they simply couldn't release an audit report or documentation of their accounts. They have to comply with the investigation, and their lawyers are telling them to sit still and don't do anything that could be construed as interference (leaking financial stability information to the public definitely could result in enhanced charges/penalties if the CFTC finds some other compliance issue).

So, IMO, Tether is likely solvent but the CFTC is digging deeper. You can bet if they had an empty Tether bank account, the CFTC would have shut down this shitshow back in December.This is the first time I'm sending some ETH out of MEW. How much gas should I include to send 1 ETH? Don't want to mess up the transaction. 

Thanks! I'd like to propose the addition of either 1) a weekly pinned thread to r/ethereum or r/ethtrader or 2) a new subreddit for the non-technical/non-developers in the community. I suspect there is a growing number of interested people with general business backgrounds (finance, operations, marketing, etc.), like myself, who are intellectually and financially invested in Ethereum. I think it would be great to have a dedicated avenue to discuss, collaborate, and network with peers on ideas for dapps, marketing, etc. This would provide a thought medium for more diverse backgrounds and skillsets than is generally available in r/ethereum. It could help bridge the gap between those who lack development backgrounds with those in the technical community. Merging non-technical folks with the technical folks would propagate sharing of ideas for dapps and decentralized workflows while providing clarity to real world feasibility and technological implications of proposed ideas. Thanks!

***I tried posting this in r/ethereum yesterday, but the bot kicked it for being a discussion that should be included in r/ethtrader. I messaged the mods to advise, but have not received a response.I will be taking part in medical chain ICO tomorrow, my first ever ICO participation. I'm slightly concerned about this so-called 'gas war' which happens during ICO's and witnessed during the telegram on DADI and Nucleas vision - many people missing out. I'm slightly concerned as I'm only sending around 1.08 ETH ($110) from MyEtherWallet and don't want most of that to go on gas. 

I'm not a tech-savvy so I don't understand what gwei/gas limit is - I tend to set recommended levels normally, but I imagine for this case that won't be enough. It is definitely one of the most hyped ICO's recently. They have approximately 52k members on telegram and over 13k members on Twitter and generally speaking good ratings from across the board, They have announced they will do KYC first which you must wait until verification before sending ETH - presumably to prevent a gas war. Admins are therefore not giving recommendations, so I assume there will be some sort of gas war during this process. So I would like a very fast transaction under a minute. If I send my entire balance on MEW (0.108 ETH), will I be able send it within a minute double the recommended levels = 40 gwei and 42000 limit? How much would this detract from the total I will send - should the network be clogged up slightly? Also I'm assuming that gas price is included in the amount I send, and I don't need to leave some ETH in MEW for the gas? Helping friend, has a key from an old hardware wallet but doesn't remember which or where.  8 digit key with combo of letters/numbers.  Any way to find out for sure? Any recommendations on where to start? So this is a analogy of how i see ETH at the moment,

ETH is like a major city and its surrounded by many smaller towns known as ECR20 tokens. This city is good but it needs more people living in it, and needs more usage. The current problem is it cant really deal with more people living in it, it needs better roads and infastructure to work. Raiden, Plasma and Sharding can all help build this much needed infastructure which will allow huge amounts of people to enter and allow ETH to grow into a mega city. (scaling) This will not only bring more people to the city but itll connect the surrounding ECR20 towns together allowing evrything to grow as one. 

Meanwhile other neighboring cities are coming out and competing for resources. ETH is like a large organism which is ready to explode if it can gain good scalability, if it can solve this problem early it will have an exponential affect relative to its competition.


PS Just my two cents,  Im not high, just bored.
https://twitter.com/CryptoOfKorea/status/958815334072537090

On January 31st, CoinDuck, an Ethereum based offline electronic wallet payment service will launch in various regions of the Korea. This is one of the most wide spread use cases for cryptocurrency South Korea has seen.

While  is promoting password settlement for the first time among online shopping malls in Korea with Bithumb, the number of places that can purchase general goods or services as passwords in offline stores is rapidly increasing.

There are about 100 registered merchants since the official launch of CoinDuck on January 4th, and Seoul has 29. In addition, the rest of the franchises are distributed nationwide including Gyeonggi, Gyeongnam, Chungnam, Jeonbuk, and Gangwon.

Industries vary: Cafes, restaurants, restaurants, guesthouses, institutes, pharmacies and opticians can also use Coin-de-service. Notable merchants include real estate, law firms, farms, and porcelain shops.

CoinDuck is trying to broaden the scope of co-operation with Pyeongchang ahead of the opening of the Winter Olympics next month. The goal is to increase the number of Pyeongchang franchisees so that foreign athletes, foreigners, and cheerleaders can use the CoinDuck services.Got a decent amount of dust left in binance. Anyone got any ethereum based dApps they like that I could could throw a little bit at? So I can rejoice with all of you rather than hate your guts.

I will say that Ethereum is showing rather amazing strength when all other cryptos are struggling.First I want you to picture a brand new Lambo thats worth $300K. Its Red. Its beautiful. Its just been washed and waxed. Can you see it? Additionally, this Lambo is generating revenue thats growing exponentially. Even better, it wont depreciate when you drive off the lot. In fact, the dealership will continue to use those increasing cash flows to buy back a piece of that Lambo in perpetuity. Now, for some unknown reason, this Lambo is 40% off. So instead of paying $300K, you can steal this cash cow for $180K. 

Thats Iconomi. Right meow. And the irrationality of this market is killing me. Kariba REDD+ will be the first supply side project to make natural assets available for sale on the EARTH token Natural Asset Exchange (NAE). The Kariba REDD+ project has a long standing relationship with impactChoice and will be using EARTH token for the settlement of transactions on the platform. 

Specifically, Kariba REDD+ will act as an inaugural supplier on the NAE and begin loading natural assets and make them available for trade from the first day of operations. Demand side buyers will be able to purchase Kariba REDD+ natural assets using the EARTH token.

https://earth-token.com/Yes, it is possible Tether has 2 billion dollars. That shouldnt be the main focus of this debate.

What confuses me about the people screaming FUD, is why are you not concerned about the complete lack of transparency?

Tether promised frequent audits. There hasnt even been one. There has been zero proof of solvency. Why are you blindly trusting that they are solvent?

Its not unreasonable, and it certainly isnt FUD, to be slightly suspicious of a company that promised to be transparent and then has been the complete opposite.

Why would a solvent company not release an audit after they promised they would do so frequently and in a transparent way?

We should be focusing on the complete lack of audits, not the possibility of them owning $2 billion.

Edit: Facts you dont like are not FUD. Its a fact there has been no auditI see a lot of people mixing up market capitalisation and how much cash has actually entered into a crypto (cash inflow). 

Tether is often compared to bitconnect (as they had a similar market cap before the crash) but they couldn't be more different.

If you are ensure about the difference check out this article which can explain it better than I ever could: http://jamescrypto.com/the-difference-between-inflow-and-market-cap-and-how-it-relates-to-tethers/

Venezuelas economy is in deep trouble. To dig itself out, on Tuesday the Venezuelan government unveiled its full plans for the Petro, a bespoke digital currency backed by the countrys oil resources.
https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9knegp/the-venezuelan-government-is-doing-an-ethereum-token-sale-to-support-its-new-cryptocurrency-petroThe title reveals everything,i tried to submit a link from businessinsider(Ethereum has outpaced its rival cryptocurrencies since the start of 2018) but it is not submitted.Is there any new changes in rules here?I did the 'air gapped' method of creating a new wallet and sending my portfolio there and haven't actually looked at my balance from the wallet itself while being online. LoLThe team from **DAO PlayMarket 2.0** (PMT token) is attacking a $20 billion Android market ([source](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/29/app-annie-android-to-top-ios-in-app-store-revenue-this-year)) by providing the first decentralized Android app store based on crypto including a revolutionary built-in ICO platform for developers, which no competitor offers  [(whitepaper)](https://ico.playmarket.io/#whitepaper).


With all the markets being down currently, the DAO Playmarket token (PMT) is now trading 30% to 60% below ICO price on Etherdelta: 

[https://etherdelta.com/#0xc1322d8ae3b0e2e437e0ae36388d0cfd2c02f1c9-eth](https://etherdelta.com/#0xc1322d8ae3b0e2e437e0ae36388d0cfd2c02f1c9-eth).

ICO was 0.12 to 0.2 ETH ([source](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/dao-playmarket-2-0/))



Even better, seeing that the PMT token was already **submitted for listing on Yobit, Bittrex and Bitfinex** [(twitter)](https://twitter.com/en_playmarket2), I am quite bullish even on the short term, as this will attract an even larger crowd and this project is currently not widely known at all. Long term, if the team can pull this off and cut out a slice of this massive mobile market for themselves, this is an even more interesting project, especially since there are only 3m tokens.


What are your thoughts on this project?

[https://ico.playmarket.io/](https://ico.playmarket.io/)


Cons I can see:

- Not known or established yet, major marketing campaign needed (but already planned according to whitepaper &amp; roadmap)

- Serious competing Android app stores out there (all non-crypto based though)

- Developer App listings not known yet (part of marketing campaign with major incentives for developers compared to other stores)


Pros from my perspective:

- Project is past concept stage with a fairly large team &amp; advisors

- Solid, partially accomplished roadmap and funding available

- Very attractive to app developers, which in return foster decentralized growth of the project without having to hire and pay developers (as app developers work independently and contribute to the attractiveness of the platform)

- Team with experience also in the Asian app market  where crypto is booming


As with every post  do your own research and draw your own conclusions! This is not an investment or financial advice or recommendation and I am not affiliated with this projects team. I am very excited for them and hope they will succeed, all the best to them.


Now, having shared my thoughts and what I understood from the project, I am curious to hear your thoughts on this project.

Zenoic Pty LtdCan anyone think of any possible valid reason Tether doesn't release an audit immediately? I can't think of a single one. I like to know how's your strategy for investing money into Ethereum. I want to get a basic idea of what the plans are people currently making.

* Is it a long-term investment? Or just short-term trading? If it's long-term, are you following the chart's every day, or is it just like putting money into Ethereum, holding it and never look back? Or other strategies?
* What's the scale you invested? 100, 1000, 100k? Or even more?
* Are you just mining? Are you just interested into the technology Ethereum is providing you?

I'm recently more interested in Ethereum but I haven't invested any money, so I'm very curious to hear from you. From the point of view of a programmer like me Ethereum is a very interesting technology. Since I'm not an financial expert with no investing experience I'm very curious how you deal with money regarding Ethereum.Bitcoin's small bounce ready for a break through support, Ethereum as it may decouple from Bitcoin's drops, Bitcoin Cash and Neo as they consolidate and Cardano as it moves to retest support levels.

https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@matthew-analysis/daily-crypto-analysis-31st-jan-technical-analysisHi, I'm new to cryptocurrency and I recently bought some ether, I have it in exodus and would like to send it to parity. How do I do this? where do I find my receiving address in parity? Thanks!The Tether FUD is overblown and doesn't make much sense. The entire basis of the Tether FUD comes from a random anonymous Twitter account, Bitfinexed, that seemed to have a personal vendetta on Bitfinex...
https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@kjnk/why-the-tether-fud-doesn-t-make-sense-and-we-are-getting-manipulatedAm I right in assuming that the flippening is most likely going to be caused by Bitcoin's market cap lowering and meeting Ether's somewhere in the middle rather than Ether's market cap just straight up catching and overtaking it?Front running is becoming a major cause of mistrust in the cryto community. Most of the orders placed in the exchange are manipulated and we end up paying higher fee. This needs to stop and exchanges have to be more clear with their operations.The original version works just fine and is honestly genius. Dividends are paid in ETH and are still strong and for some reason the price is the ONLY price stable coin right now. For some reason all this Tether thing did not really effect this 3 days old coin and the price is rock solid. https://powhcoin.com

Well enough shilling (had to make a clear distinction), now to the bad news. The dev made a clone that includes more fees (and has fees when you sell and not only for buying). After a few hours it had almost as much ETH as the original in the contract but now a bug in the shadow contract (not the original one!) made all ETH in this clone stuck forever. https://powhcoin.com/shadowfork.html

Let this be a lession for you guys. Smart contracts can have errors and every change to it, no matter how small, can fuck everything up.So...  I got an email saying an unrecognized device had logged in to my HitBTC account.  Nice of them to notify me, except that I never signed up for one, so this made me nervous.  First, I assumed the link was just a scam, so I didn't click it.  I hovered over it, it looked weird, so I just went directly to www.hitbtc.com and typed in my email and clicked password reset.  If I have no account, that shouldn't work, problem solved.  Well, it did work, sort of.  They sent me a password reset link, and my stomach sank a bit, thinking... fuck, my identity has been stolen.   

Next, I reset the password to a unique difficult password because I'm still skeptical.  All good.
Then when I go to sign in with that password, it says...   "THANK YOU FOR SIGNING UP" and that they had sent me a confirmation email.


So... is this how hitbtc is getting people to sign up?  I mean, they don't have anything besides my email and a bogus password, so...   what the hell just happened, any ideas?Hi there, anyone can provide a link to a tutorial for writing your own trading bot on, say, gdax for example?

Language doesn't matter,  I'm a software dev so I can pick up any language easily. What I need is basically an api tutorial, maybe even an example of how to write a simple bot and how to run it.

I'd like a tutorial that walks you through writing one from scratch, not one that makes you download a bunch of frameworks and you just tweak the bot performance. Any hints welcome!Wow!

Of course, this question is asked a trillion times before, but imma do it anyway.

You see what happened with BTC, ETH, NEO etc, some big boys who climbed the markets to high heights. Now my question is; why did these coins actualy got their value? And please dont just answer as Offer - Demand :).

My next question; what are you hodling now and what would you suggest in buyin in before it is too late! But most important, WHY are you hodling, why you think it would increase in value significantly? (Mostly looking for -$50 coins)

Thank you in advance!Announcing the SWM Airdrop.

Get to it!Hi, I have my app released in beta format. Im looking for people who would be interested in using an app that posts breaking news such as tweets, reddit info and news from other sources that can affect us crypto day traders.  

The app allows any and all users to also submit news which is immediately peer reviewed and pushed to the full audience if approved. This allows us to create a large network of well informed people we can pool information from and help everyone stay ahead of the game. 

If you're interested we need android beta testers right now, the iphone version is done and will be needing beta testers for that soon to if youd like to message me about that, but android first.

If youd like to be part of the project in other ways you can message me regarding that also.

Thanks guys.

Someone else posted this here, I thought it was appropriate to resurrect.Vitalik Buterin is 24 years old today, and even though I'm about a decade older than him, I really look up to and admire him. He has dedicating himself to a cause that is so much bigger than himself or any of us. There aren't many 24-year-olds who would do that, especially if they had the kind of money he has. He isn't in this for the money. He wants to help people and make the world a better place. I believe Ethereum is going to change the world. It will lead to a tremendous amount of economic growth and provide incredible opportunities for everyone, including the very poorest on the earth. All of us, as investors, are very fortunate to have Vitalik as a visionary/thought leader. I'm indebted to him for how this investment has changed my life. Long live Vitalik! Thank you and happy birthday!Posted this to /r/BitcoinCA as well, but figured I'd spread the word to warn ETH buyers too

You can search reddit for "Kraken CAD wire" and you'll get many threads of people with issues varying from long wait times, ignored tickets, and surprise fees when the funds finally go through

I wish I had done this search prior to sending them money. I used them over a year ago when they still had EFT as an option and I naively thought that things would be more or less the same. I am still here waiting for my funds to get to my account despite the money being taken from my bank three weeks ago. Sent a ticket and escalated it twice now, still nothing

Don't make the same mistake I didThat sounds shitty and I know, Im not even a decentralize everything in the world or libertarian  fanatic type of guy, I had a lot invested at ripple at one time and it wouldve been better for me if it mooned.

But holy Fuck the community surrounding it and downing on ethereum and talking about how its shit and all of ethtrader is fucking stupid, especially when it passed market cap. it got me really pissed. They were all flaunting around like they were a bunch of geniuses and then it tanked and Im honestly happy about it, even if it made me lose some money its a great feeling.

Sorry for the random post but really thoughIf 1 million people each invest on average $100 in crytpo that is $100 million USD flowing in. What is the real life impact on marketcaps?  Far greater than just a $100 million dollar marketcap gain spread out right?  Any economics specialists want to chime in?BTC just dropped below $10k and if you look at charts on flippening.watch you see ETH's marketcap is slowly creeping up to BTCs (62% currently but only 33% on January 1st) and the flippening might happen soon. The market cap difference in percentage has been as high as 83% in June of 2017 but then both coins were still up and coming and now BTC seems in decline. The ETH/BTC trading pair has also been mostly positive during the various dips the past few weeks. 

At what flipping point (e.g., 80%) BTC traders will become aware that the flippening is imminent and then trade their BTC for ETHs which will then further exacerbate the flippening? ETH dethroning BTC as largest crypto will likely get more people to invest in ETH and the difference in market caps will expand very quickly if a flippening happens, I assume. This is kind of a strange event that has not really happened before (BCH never overtook BTC). Its all speculation at this point but would like to hear your ideas/ opinions.Welcome to the Daily Altcoin Discussion thread of /r/EthTrader.

When will we see private transactions enabled on Ethereum? I hate knowing that my coins are being tracked by gov agencies. What's the mood out there?

BTC is at $8,800 ... ETH is not entirely immune but is holding up well.

15 days ago I said I thought we were in a bear market and got downvoted in oblivion, even though I also said ETH would be attractive to accumulate at lower levels. 

In December, I said I expected BTC to fall to $8,800 and even lower after that.

Do more people acknowledge that we are in a bear market? Or do people think this is a short-term January dip? What's the overall sentiment?

Obviously, it will be time soon to start accumulating. But if there's still bullishness in the market, that means we could still go lower. I think we need to reach outright despair before we reach bottom. Nucleus vision(Backed by Tim Draper) - An IoT-based contactless identification system is announcing an airdrop event!!

You look at the entire crypto space and you look at what other products have the liquidity and the notional size, a derivative makes sense, Chris Concannon, Cboes president and chief operating officer, said on Jan. 17 &lt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-17/don-t-expect-the-crypto-futures-revolution-to-stop-at-bitcoin&gt;. He gave a caveat: **Cboe wont introduce other crypto-derivatives until its futures exchange starts using the trading software acquired last year from Bats Global Markets. That upgrade is scheduled for Feb. 25** 

I was in their Telegram group and the team said they would be launching Q1 2018 in China. I made a simple info-graphic to compare - https://imgur.com/5dunkCl - Thoughts?A few hundred thousand people in the GTA at least just heard that message.

Here's hoping they flip the right side of the coin and dive into ETH!

I can't believe they suggested DASH... isn't it illegal to give out investment advice over the radio anyways?Has anyone had any problems during high-volume moments, being able to submit and process immediately a market order using Kraken's standard interface ( not the cryptowatch one ) ? Does it execute orders immediately using this method ?

I am leaving the cryptowatch interface aside, it is a total fail for precision trading.
I'm personally fan of GNT, BAT, REQ and FUN tokens... I'll be buying more of them now that the market  
plummeted but I would like you guys to recommend me more projects to do some research.

Thanks in Advance.A look at the dramatic events of today's market. Areas to look for in BTCUSD for a possible longer term bear market. A look at Ethereum's strength and an overview of BCH, NEO and ADA's lack of strength.

https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@matthew-analysis/daily-crypto-analysis-1st-feb-technical-analysisNo, really, I'm interested. In fact, would like to write an article about it. What are the real reasons why something as basic as protecting your KYC list is so hard? Why can't an ICO team funnel guaranteed contributions through a given time period so as to avoid gas wars and transaction congestion? Why can't the marketing people somehow get it through naive investors' thick skulls that they shouldn't click on links from emails?

In other words, why can't someone just run a token sale with a degree of competence? (And feel free to suggest those that have...)During the last month we've seen a huge market correction, yet ETH is still doing fairly well and improving it's BTC ratio. Shouldn't most ERC20 tokens see the some of the same stability? Just seems like what is good for the goose should be good for the gander.1)  Declare that you might make crypto illegal, or vaguely refer to a possibility that legislation will make it hard to use / mine / sell / profit from.

2)  Have your citizens panic sell, thus brining a huge fiat influx into your citizens' pockets, thus a) increasing your tax revenue downstream and b) increasing spending in your country as that money burns holes in peoples pockets.

3)  Profit.Hi,

I live in California (unfortunately), I was wondering if in the US, you get tax both @ Federal &amp; State level for any capital gain you've made during 2017?

IF so, I understand that Federal has bracket which depends on your income + capital gain, what about the state (especially California)?

One last thing, to pay those capital gain tax, would you rather :

* Take a loan
* Cash out your BTC/ETH

Thanks yallI bought into iexec (RLC) at .55CAD so this isnt a plea for my mortgage being gambled or anything. Im Still up but wondering if anyone else is worried that the complete lack of marketing and low volume trading is a bad sign for future growth?

Im 75 %Eth
10% RLC
10% OMG
And 5% zrx 

right now wondering if I should take my constantly dwindling profits on RLC and put them into omg. I know the fundamentals havent changed but theres so much red lolHonestly, I have had it with alll the "kill BTC-XRP-BCH" subscribers over here.
You guys just do not get the big picture.. ETH this, ETH that, kill BTC or whatever crypto except ETH.
What we need is crypto to get adopted, Be it BTC, ETH or Ripple,
Some people love a Volvo, another person loves a Nissan.
Please stop putting other Crypto than ETH down,  we do not want a community  as toxic as /r/btc or /r/bitcoin, come guys and galls , you can do better!longtime eth hodler here- just wanted to get some feedback from the community. I have access to custom minting silver bullion designs. I was curious if there'd be any interest in 1 oz silver bullion w/ the Ethereum logo stamped on its face?

Because of marginal costs, i'd unfortunately be unable to sell at spot price so what would be a reasonable premium over spot for this? Strong ETH + cheap alts = free money.  As much as I love my ETH, trading a lot of it for solid alts today (BAT nomnom).  This feels like an episode of Supermarket Sweep.

https://i.imgur.com/36YXoI7.gifThe main point is bitcoin needs to basically die so that there will be less emphasis of BTC pairings and the crypto space can flourish.

I understand the BTC pairing point, especially since my alt coins and even etherium would dip with bitcoin, but my question is, if etherium overtake bitcoin, how does that influence the market as a whole and other alt coins?

Besides more money from bitcoin going into ETH and other coins, how will that influence other people into investing into crypto when theres so much omg bitcoin going down. Bitcoin this bitcoin that Importance?

I for one want bitcoin to fall just because I hate seeing how much my alt coins would suffer because bitcoin FUD. Theres so much more to crypto than bitcoin, but it seems like outsiders dont see it that way.

Would the flippening help market cap reach previous levels of 700-800+ billion market cap?
I've withdrawn eth from Bitstamp (to coinbase) dozens of times with no problems. However, this morning I transferred a larger sum of money. Transaction confirmed quickly and bitstamp gave me a txID, but the ID is not coming up on any blockchain explorers. This was hours ago.I couldn't do it anymore, there's been too much FUD in the news about the flippening recently so I had to sell all of my stake.... In BITCOIN!! Hodling on to my ETH till we die, let's ride boys!Hello
Has others tried out this app from this big company
Looks to me like the only way to get Eth into and out of your  DeVere Crypo   wallet is by fiat currencies  you are not given a Eth send and receive blockchain address fro lodging Eth
What's the point of the app soleading title, sorry.

one would think that eth is about to pump hard. 

"stable coin OG" all alts are falling.Yes, I am that stupid person who converted ETH into BCH twice and lost 50% of the ETH. 
Not touching ETH is the mantra !!Maybe people don't want to give away their trading strategies if they are working, but any suggestions other than just HODL and wait it out?

I tried scalping based on the 1 and 5 min charts, and it's an easy way to make 1 or 2% quickly a few times a day, until the market moves against you, so I don't think that's for me.I read [the following article](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-31/bitcoin-is-the-new-gold) by Noah Smith, who is a smart guy whose analysis I generally like. 

In it he outlines three reasons to be sceptical of bitcoin as a currency, and one reason to be cautiously optimistic of it as an investment. While he is talking about bitcoin, everything he writes is more or less true of other cryptocurrencies too. To summarise, he points out bitcoin's high transaction fees, and long confirmation times, but also acknowledges those are things that can be fixed with time  if not by bitcoin then by other cryptocurrencies. He then goes to argue that cryptocurrencies will never replace fiat because if they are a good investment, they will not be useful as a currency, and vice versa  the US dollar is a terrible investment but a good currency, while Apple shares might make good investments, but you wouldn't want to be paid in them, due to volatility. He ends the piece by stipulating that even though crypto might never be used as currency, it might still hold its value, due to sheer willpower of those who believe it has value (he draws a parallel to gold, which isn't unreasonable). 

The reason I am more bullish than Noah Smith  and he is by no means a  bear  is that he seems to be missing an alternate use-case for cryptocurrencies in general, and Ether in particular. I can imagine a scenario where international bank transfers are replaced by Ether transfers. With the right technical innovations transaction fees would be lower than bank transfer fees, and the transactions could be completed faster. If I visit a friend in Hong Kong, and I want to split a bill, I can imagine a future in which I buy Ether in own currency, transfer ether, and have them sell ether to their local currency, much more easily, and cheaply, than an international bank transfer. In addition, of course,  and so far everything I've said would apply to all crypto currencies  Ether has the use case of smart contracts, and even if Web3.0 doesn't take the world by storm, there is likely enough of a use case to keep Ether's value to something reasonable.

In an attempt to prevent money laundering and other illegal activity, South Korea has placed a ban effective 30th January 2018 on all cryptocurrency trading using anonymous bank accounts. Additionally, this move is expected to also increase the transparency of cryptocurrency trading in South Korea.Lots of people are fearful that the bug will be replicated on other ER20 tokens and are getting rid of them.  The panic hurts my portfolio.I have been getting error codes when placing orders on cryptowatch recently that are not listed on their [Trading Interface Errors Page](https://trade.kraken.com/docs/trading-interface-errors#911) for the past couple of days.

The most recent error code I received was 911. 

Curious if anyone else has noticed this (especially on ETH/BTC orders)Is it necessary to make a MEW account if Im holding ETH in coinbase for a year or longer? What is the purpose of making a MEW account? Im sorry if these are really simple questions. Thanks!For more details you can check out their medium: https://medium.com/legolas-exchange

I have also received one, and would love to get a thoughtful discussion going. 

My form claims that I earned several magnitudes more than what I actually did, and I understand that's true for most others so far. 

Box 1a appears to report the gross aggregate for all USD transactions received. For instance, if I bought 1 BTC at $1000, and sold it for $1100, then Coinbase would report $1100 in box 1a. Do I have this correct? It's the only way I can make sense of the form. Otherwise it's clearly false.**ConsenSys, a global player now well established in Europe, has been selected as partner to support the EU Observatory's outreach in Europe** following a call for tenders &lt;https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-blockchain-observatory-and-forum&gt; launched last year.

I'm going to be bold: I think Ethereum will overtake Bitcoin in market cap within 72 hours. I think we're going to see a slow building and once it's within 90% or so, it'll just make a bull run and the two will switch incredibly quickly.Sp8de is a protocol for decentralized blockchain based platform with multiple features that are essential for the growing blockchain gambling industry and whose solid implementation is lacking in any of the currently existing projects in this space.

**Intro**

* Hello, 
* my name is Ozzak Jure Matich, I live in Ireland, and I joined the revolution last summer. 
Im a crypto enthusiast and firm believer that Bitcoin will change the world. When I started trading I choose Kraken to be my main exchange because of leveraged trading and because Kraken had a really good reputation and I believed Kraken is more trustworthy than other exchanges. And I stuck with Kraken even thought user experience on the site was terrible at times. What a mistake that was.

**10th** **of** **January**

* On the 10th of I had 2.14 BTC on my trading acc and I had 2 open LONG positions on EUR and USD pairs both. When the Korea FUD started (11th of Jan around 4am) I flipped my EUR position, I sold all of my BTC and I was just about to flip my USD position when the Kraken site went down with no warning what so ever.

**Down** **time** **** **11th-13th**  **of** **January**

* How unprofessionally and poorly Kraken handled the upgrade that was supposed to be 2 hours and ended up being 2 days you can see on the here: https://status.kraken.com/incidents/nswthr1lyx72  https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7qcj9u/why_kraken_is_an_unsafebad_exchange_and_why_you/  
And during this 2 days I was surprisingly calm and chilled because I believed that Kraken isnt doing an exit scam and that my funds are safe.
Even thought I had an open long position that I didnt want, and that I couldnt close.

**Back** **online** **-** **13th** **January**

* When the site came back online I was -2 000 on my USD long position and -2000 on EUR story position. I dont need to tell you I would never put myself in this situation if I could log in normally.  So I decided to wait a bit and see what the price does, before I start closing anything.

**BUG** **time** **-** **15th** **January**

* I decided to take some loss and close parts of my positions just to reduce the risk. And I went ahead to close 0.5 BTC position and I was supposed to lose about 200 on this but instead of 200 I lost 24.82 and 0.43989 BTC (about 5700 at the time), and than another 0.1 BTC = 0.53989 BTC lost to the bug.
	Trades no. TN3GFZ-MUTQZ-UUEGJT and TLAROT-6QQCT-D7K7VB, you can see the screen shots here: https://postimg.org/gallery/23wckpjj0/629bad23/
	Of course after that I did what you are supposed to do when you find a serious BUG, you contact support and wait for instructions. What a mistake that was.

**Support** **time** **-** **15th** **-30th** **January**

* I contacted Kraken support Ticket #1369001, I managed to get my ticket escalated quite fast. I was contacted by Mr. Jochen from Kraken customer support quite fast I must say.
* But here is where real problems started.
	Jochen sent me 2 emails on the 15th, Jan but he didnt answer not one question I had or gave me any useful information. He just said: We have identified the issue and hope to resolve this as soon as possible.
	My main question was: **What do I do with my open positions?**
	Theres a bug If I closed my positions I would get completely liquidated. Jochen completely ignored me and he answered my question on the 30th of January saying: The bug is resolved and you can close positions without issues. Thats 15 days to late. If I closed the positions on the 30th I would have some 0.3 BTC left on the account. 

**E-mails** **-** **15th** **Jan** **-** **1st** **of** **Feb**

* During this time I sent over 30 emails to Jochen and Robert from Kraken customer support.
Robert didnt replay not even once. And Jochen sent me 3 emails. 2 on the 15th saying that they are on top of the problem and 1 on the 30th (15 days to late) saying that I can close my position (and get liquidated).
	You can see his emails here: https://postimg.org/gallery/1u0tompss/ 
	And you can see some of my emails here: https://postimg.org/gallery/33nm6p924/ 
	My emails for the first few days were: What do I do? **Can I close my position?** and then after they were just: Can someone please answer me?
	
**Summary** **1st** **of** **Feb**

* I had  2.14 BTC before the Kraken went down
* I lost  24.82 and 0.53989 BTC directly to the BUG
* I lost another 10 436.01 and 0.1172BTC indirectly to the BUG (couldnt close for 15 days)
* And I lost some 0.3 by my own fault trying to trade without margin (has nothing to do with bug, I was panicking, and Im not expecting to get this bit back) xD
* After closing all the positions I have 1880 or 0.25BTC at current prices left on my account.

* Witch makes my **total** **losses** **to** **the** **BUG:** **~1.6BTC**

**Questions** **for** **Kraken** **staff:**

* Can I please talk to someone**actually** **talk** **back** **and** **forth** **conversation???**
	Why didnt you answer me for so long?
	When will I be reimbursed? And in which currency?
	Will I be reimbursed for indirect loses as well?
	Theres only a small number or people affected by the bug, why is this lasting for so long?
	WHERE IS MY MONEY ??
	Will I have to wait for another 15 days for your answer?
	Can someone please answer my questions finally?
	I did everything by the book, I found the BUG, I reported it and I waited for your instructions. Was I supposed to lose my funds to the BUG on purpose?

This is the latest comment by /u/kranen-tyler 

**HOW** **IS** **THIS** **FAIR** **???**Just got an [email](https://imgur.com/gallery/9s0Ta) from coinbase. All credit cards transactions are most likely considered as a cash advance.

This puts a wrinkle in my current plan of buying ether by dollar cost averaging. I usually buy eth, every two weeks using my credit card. We can't use debit card here in Canada. So Coinbase is totally useless in Canada !!!!

I don't believe there are other options in Canada where I get to buy crypto every week for amounts less than $20. 

Definitely a blow to Canadian customers. Banks fighting back I guess!!!!





EDIT1: You can use a Mastercard/Visa debit card...But that has its own additional fees too!!!The Bee Token ICO has somehow leaked everyones Emails and potentially ID's. Apart from the obvious scam, this leaves you vulnerable to identity theft, especially in regards to any funds you may be holding on exchanges!

I need to buy some right now and this is getting frustrating. Anyone else's verification ever take this damn long?The 200EMA is at 568.23USD and we only dropped to 726.43USD which means we're still overvalued according to those calculations. The SMA which doesn't weigh as much on the recent movements puts the 200DMA at 481.26USD which should be a huge bouncing point for ETH. I still believe we're going to see something between those numbers sooner or later during this bear market.

BTC dropped to -2,65x from ATH and ETH hasn't dropped lower than -1.95x. BTC should be more resistant anyways due to it being number 1 and also a honey badger so we're probably in for a bigger ETH drop than what we've seen. It's still 245USD from the 200SMA. The market doesn't care anyways.

Not trying to spread FUD, I'm trying to provide some simple Technical Analysis. Remember to always watch the benchmark (which at the moment is BTC) and that a healthy market is a better market.

Edit: This subreddit really needs to calm down. It's about trading ETH right? So input from both sides should be useful.The "price" of eth isn't changing as rapidly as many these posts seem to imply. When a large dip happens or a large rise happens very quickly, it's a result of a lack of liquidity in the market. If someone (or in reality many people), want to sell a large amount of ethereum they start to eat through the limit buy orders on the book. Once market sell orders overwhelm limit buy orders, the price starts to drop rapidly. The same thing happens in reverse. This is not "manipulation". That's not how markets work. It's a fundamental supply and demand equilibrium. It drops quickly or rises quickly due to a lack of liquidity at the current price.

The most "manipulation" that can happen is that someone sells a lot of eth quickly to drop the price., hoping that others will panic sell, and that market makers will come in at the new low price so they can rebuy. People do this, but it's extremely risky if that's your actual strategy. What if you unload 20k eth, dropping the price a lot, and some other whale comes in while you're doing this and rebuys? Then the price is suddenly a lot higher than a good chunk of your sells.

Relax. This is crypto, it's going to be volatile.[ETH chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/rJhiT8rz/)

Look at the buying volume for the 3 green candles on the huge spikes up in the last hour. Much higher volume than any in this downtrend.

It's a classic capitulation bottom and reversal.I'm starting to learn solidity, playing around in Ropsten. Now I figured I'd try to issue my own token, same as ICOs do.

Beside the official ethereum site, is there a good template, tutorial or video?

I googled around but all I got was some snippets of codesEven those of us who have been through these stomach-churning corrections a few times might be reaching for the wet towels about now - this is the worst rout since last summer.

But this too shall pass. Nothing has really changed since Christmas, or Halloween, or indeed last Spring, when this rally really got going. Blockchain is going to change the world, and Ethereum is far and away the best positioned to take advantage of the coming shift. 

Hang on tight everyone! Its tax season and mining is taxed as income tax and essentially altogether typically my income is taxed at around 30% with local/state/federal. So over the past year all the ETH mined is either going to require someone to either shell out some fiat or sell ETH to cover their taxes.
Hi fellow Etherians,  
   
Just crossposting from our main sub:  
/r/aethia/comments/7uqy5e/we_are_building_aethia_ask_us_anything/
  
Building the #1 (F2P) Blockchain based game, with actual content/story etc.  
Happy to see your feedback!Twice now in the past 24 hours, the price has been steadily decreasing, only to pop over 10% in &lt;5 minutes. The price just jumped from $730 all the way up to $840 on a single run, and now it will continue to crash slowly like it was before.

Edit: Looks like the run is lasting even longer this time. Over a 20% jump within 10 minutes.FUD ought to be defined as Foolish Unwavering Denial.

We're in an extended bear market and this thread refuses to acknowledge that.

- The last ATH for BTC was reached in December 17, followed by a series of ever lower lows.
- The last ATH for market capitalization was January 7, followed by a series of ever lower lows.

Market capitalization now stands at $356 billion ... roughly $475 billion in market cap has evaporated.

We're not in a bull market. So logically, we must be in a bear market. But people here refuse to use that word. Why? Because of Foolish Unwavering Denial.
 
Among the many rhetorical objections I've seen on this thread:

- Zoom out. Look at the gains at the gains over the past year!

I applaud those gains. But looking at the past 12 months doesn't provide any guidance as to what to expect over the next 12 months. 

- It's just volatility!

Volatility goes in both directions. A manic, parabolic run-up is followed by its opposite

- What does a bear market even mean?

It's what we're in now! It's what follows when the last ATH has been reached. 

I've stated before that we're in a bull market and HODL is the best course.
https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7qrwl8/dont_kid_yourselves_this_is_a_bear_market_and_its/

"It's too early to tell" is my favorite objection to the bear market.

If it's too early to tell whether we're in a bear market, then it's certainly too early for me to buy these dips. We haven't reached true bottom yet.  

As long as there is Foolish Unwavering Denial in the market, we still have lower to go.I'm looking for a place to buy eth. I've tried to make an account on kraken with 3 different emails but for some reason it doesn't work, gdax/ coinbase's verification process is an absolute nightmare and O want that to be simple because I'm going to buying eth through a friend in the us and tbh I'd rather buy btc through localbitcoins and convert it to eth than buy from coinbase.
My current options are Gemini, Coinmama and Cex and I'm really gravitated towards Coinmama because of the simple verification procedure. Is there any reason I should go for gemini, cex or any other exchanges?
ps. I don't mind paying fees up to 7% I'm more concerned about simple and fast (or nonexistent) verification and fast processing I know that everyone's looking at the price and probably confused and worried. The fact of the matter is, price has decoupled from fundamentals in the cryptocurrency markets a long time ago...
https://steemit.com/ethereum/@kjnk/just-a-quick-reminder-of-ethereum-s-fundamentalsLet me start by saying that this is all just hypothetical.

So most of us have heard about the bitfinex and USDT FUD, so I was thinking about that and came up with this--

What if bitfinex is, in fact insolvent, but they are buying thousands of bitcoin with their newly printed tether, all to send those bitcoin to exchanges that deal with USD and they are basically exchanging their fake tether for real USD and exiting with billions of dollars. 

On dips like today, you have to wonder who just casually has a billion dollars worth of bitcoin they are willing to dump on the market at these prices. Hello everyone

Today is my happy day I have been in coma for 23 days from a serious issue called coma-itis. It is serious and debilitating condition.

I hope you are having a good day. 

I can't wait to see how my trading portfolio is going.Seems that we are struck by the endless string of bad news and crypto-regulation changes recently. Not a single good news in-sight and I wonder, should we prepare for the worst?I don't know about most people but I get a lot of mine from youtube, but I feel like there is a massive bias towards buying or holding, no matter what the conditions. 

I get that no one wants to spread rumours that will cause more panic, and especially on youtube any pessimistic videos get disliked by viewers. 

But does anyone know any vblogger or other info source that isn't afraid to give a neutral, honest opinion?Let's say you own $2000 worth of Eth, Btc, and Bch which was all airdropped to you. 
You trade $1000 worth of Eth for ZRX.
At that point, you would pay taxes (for this sample let's just say 20%) on $1000. (-$200)
In prep for tax season and to cash out you decide to sell all of your ZRX.
ZRX is up 50% (+$500). 
You owe another 20% tax on the 50% gain. (-$100)
The ZRX was then traded for ETH (or Btc, or Bch) because it is the only way to turn it into fiat. 

According to FIFO, would you have to pay capital gains tax again on the original principal Eth? Meaning another 20% tax on the entire amount? In this example.  20% on $1500 = -$300

Tally that up and you have $1500 of value.
You owe $600. 
You end up with $900 principle which is $100 less than where you started. Is this correct?

edit: 
A more realistic scenario might be you want to purchase a different alt coin so you purchase more Eth at current market price (in order to not touch your initial Eth holdings). Would long time holders be required to automatically pay 20% tax according to FIFO rules? (i used airdrop in the example because for long time holders your initial principal might be very low so it's near zero) Noob question possibly, but I'm wondering how the price of crypto falls if people aren't seller to ask for crypto at a lower price on the markets? I have a coinbase account and use gdax but I don't see any option to make "an offer" on eth or btc for a price lower than what I see. Or am I viewing it all wrong? How else does the price of crypto fall if people don't have the option to buy lower than the market value?https://i.hizliresim.com/JQAbpQ.png

here you can see orders of 0.001. once sell orders eat buy orders the bots fill the gaps in prices with orders such as 0.00100000 then once they reach their target they can easily pump or dump the prices.


in some instances, you can spend/buy 10 bitcoins and raise the price of bitcoin around 80 dollars. Shouldnt be possible with such a big market but it is.

Check yourself from gdax and let me know what you think.

What they aim?
1- Pushing prices down as much as possible and collecting more coins at below before mooning it?
2- Some whales are bored from crpyto and are looking to invest elsewhere and are exiting while also profiting. (selling huge numbers of bitcoin to exit will crash the market and you wont be able to sell 50.000 bitcoin from the same price.)
3- Profit in short term then abandon it and leave the price to its own nature or market.Coinmarketcap uses BTC and USD. Neither of those are helpful when trying to figure out what alts have moved against ETH.

Q. Does DGD track the price of gold?

A. No. DGX is the gold-backed token, set to be released/launched in March. DGD is the token that rakes in a percentage of all transactions as well as a demurrage (storage) fee.  

&amp;nbsp;

Q. What does the DigixDAO do?

A. The DigixDAO currently holds 466,000 Ether, or roughly $440 million dollars. DGD holders will vote on how to spend the money. Its purpose is to grow the Digix platform.

&amp;nbsp;

Q. What is DGX good for?

A. DGX is a stablecoin that tracks the price of gold. It is fully audited on-chain which means that you won't have to deal with any shady shit like Tether.

&amp;nbsp;

Q. What's the difference between DGX and Dai (the MakerDAO token).

A. Dai is a stablecoin designed to track USD. It does so by creating collateralized loans. DGX will be one such collateral used to borrow Dai against. Ultimately, though, they are just different instances of stable token currencies.

&amp;nbsp;

Q. What is the supply of DGD and where can I buy it?

A. The supply is fixed at 2,000,000. All have been released. Currently, you can purchase on binance, Huobi, or OKEx.

&amp;nbsp;

Q. Where is the gold stored?

A. Somewhere in a Singaporean vault.

&amp;nbsp;

Q. Doesn't that mean it's slightly centralized?

A. Yes. That is the tradeoff for having gold actually be used as a medium of exchange. It's no more centralized than gold certificates or gold stored with some custodian somewhere. The only improvement is physical gold, but good luck using that as a meaningful medium of exchange.
Do crypto traders who don't move their money back to fiat actually report to gov tax agencies and pay taxes? I've participated in a few icos in the past years but I'm generally just a hodler because taxes sound too complicated. Just curious what people are doing since it must be a crazy headache if you were to actually report all your trades. Most everyone is excited about the price and yells HODL often, but if you are planning on staking than why does the price matter?

With mentions of PoS happening this year I am just trying to get a better understanding of the arguments for both sides. I'm assuming the majority of users here are like me and don't own 100+ ETH, would Staking still make sense?I'm not Nostradamus but I've gone trough similar shit in the past, whenever we see coins going down -20% in just a day, bullish news appear magically and market just skyrockets next days...Tomorrow all posts will be about guys complaining selling low and others who didn't buy the dip...

Same story repeats again and again and again....When will we see private transactions enabled on Ethereum? I hate knowing that my coins are being tracked by gov agencies. What's the mood out there?

BTC is at $8,800 ... ETH is not entirely immune but is holding up well.

15 days ago I said I thought we were in a bear market and got downvoted in oblivion, even though I also said ETH would be attractive to accumulate at lower levels. 

In December, I said I expected BTC to fall to $8,800 and even lower after that.

Do more people acknowledge that we are in a bear market? Or do people think this is a short-term January dip? What's the overall sentiment?

Obviously, it will be time soon to start accumulating. But if there's still bullishness in the market, that means we could still go lower. I think we need to reach outright despair before we reach bottom. Nucleus vision(Backed by Tim Draper) - An IoT-based contactless identification system is announcing an airdrop event!!

I am leaving the cryptowatch interface aside, it is a total fail for precision trading.
I'm personally fan of GNT, BAT, REQ and FUN tokens... I'll be buying more of them now that the market  
plummeted but I would like you guys to recommend me more projects to do some research.

Thanks in Advance.A look at the dramatic events of today's market. Areas to look for in BTCUSD for a possible longer term bear market. A look at Ethereum's strength and an overview of BCH, NEO and ADA's lack of strength.

https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@matthew-analysis/daily-crypto-analysis-1st-feb-technical-analysisNo, really, I'm interested. In fact, would like to write an article about it. What are the real reasons why something as basic as protecting your KYC list is so hard? Why can't an ICO team funnel guaranteed contributions through a given time period so as to avoid gas wars and transaction congestion? Why can't the marketing people somehow get it through naive investors' thick skulls that they shouldn't click on links from emails?

In other words, why can't someone just run a token sale with a degree of competence? (And feel free to suggest those that have...)During the last month we've seen a huge market correction, yet ETH is still doing fairly well and improving it's BTC ratio. Shouldn't most ERC20 tokens see the some of the same stability? Just seems like what is good for the goose should be good for the gander.1)  Declare that you might make crypto illegal, or vaguely refer to a possibility that legislation will make it hard to use / mine / sell / profit from.

2)  Have your citizens panic sell, thus brining a huge fiat influx into your citizens' pockets, thus a) increasing your tax revenue downstream and b) increasing spending in your country as that money burns holes in peoples pockets.

3)  Profit.Hi,

I live in California (unfortunately), I was wondering if in the US, you get tax both @ Federal &amp; State level for any capital gain you've made during 2017?

IF so, I understand that Federal has bracket which depends on your income + capital gain, what about the state (especially California)?

One last thing, to pay those capital gain tax, would you rather :

* Take a loan
* Cash out your BTC/ETH

Thanks yallI bought into iexec (RLC) at .55CAD so this isnt a plea for my mortgage being gambled or anything. Im Still up but wondering if anyone else is worried that the complete lack of marketing and low volume trading is a bad sign for future growth?

Im 75 %Eth
10% RLC
10% OMG
And 5% zrx 

right now wondering if I should take my constantly dwindling profits on RLC and put them into omg. I know the fundamentals havent changed but theres so much red lolHonestly, I have had it with alll the "kill BTC-XRP-BCH" subscribers over here.
You guys just do not get the big picture.. ETH this, ETH that, kill BTC or whatever crypto except ETH.
What we need is crypto to get adopted, Be it BTC, ETH or Ripple,
Some people love a Volvo, another person loves a Nissan.
Please stop putting other Crypto than ETH down,  we do not want a community  as toxic as /r/btc or /r/bitcoin, come guys and galls , you can do better!longtime eth hodler here- just wanted to get some feedback from the community. I have access to custom minting silver bullion designs. I was curious if there'd be any interest in 1 oz silver bullion w/ the Ethereum logo stamped on its face?

Because of marginal costs, i'd unfortunately be unable to sell at spot price so what would be a reasonable premium over spot for this? Strong ETH + cheap alts = free money.  As much as I love my ETH, trading a lot of it for solid alts today (BAT nomnom).  This feels like an episode of Supermarket Sweep.

https://i.imgur.com/36YXoI7.gifThe main point is bitcoin needs to basically die so that there will be less emphasis of BTC pairings and the crypto space can flourish.

I understand the BTC pairing point, especially since my alt coins and even etherium would dip with bitcoin, but my question is, if etherium overtake bitcoin, how does that influence the market as a whole and other alt coins?

Besides more money from bitcoin going into ETH and other coins, how will that influence other people into investing into crypto when theres so much omg bitcoin going down. Bitcoin this bitcoin that Importance?

I for one want bitcoin to fall just because I hate seeing how much my alt coins would suffer because bitcoin FUD. Theres so much more to crypto than bitcoin, but it seems like outsiders dont see it that way.

Would the flippening help market cap reach previous levels of 700-800+ billion market cap?
Now that Etherdelta is no more. Where can I buy/sell ERC-20 tokens like ZRX and District 0x? Thanks and HODL strong. The entire crypto market cap list ~$80 billion (according to coinmarketcap) today but... the US stock market lost $1.6 trillion (according to CNBC).

I do understand it's less of a percentage but still.. the amount of "real" money in this market is still in it's infancy.

I switched from USDT to ETH because I wanted to day trade without stress (heard USDT was trouble), and ETH worked out great for me, I was making money day trading. (far more than I had made with USDT) ETH was worth around 1175 when I switched to it. I had around $18.83 when I switched to it, it was around January 27 or so. Trading every day I hit a high of around $58 a few days ago and currently have $43.71 (and it's still going down)

If ETH had remained at 1175 instead of going down I'd have $75.90 right now. (It's under 675 now) And not just that, because it's all going down I can't day trade ETH with altcoins the way I was the past few days, they have less trading volume and their price is going down without really coming back up. So not only have I lost money (I gained money overall only because of trading, ETH's price caused me to make far less gains than I would have) but I can't even make money in the current conditions because the markets aren't behaving the same way so trading for profit is hard. And I already mentioned there are less trades going on.

If I sound like I'm whining it's because I *am*. And I know it's not dignified, but what the hell man. I thought ETH was safe of all things, I'd heard good things about it. Now I find out nothing is safe. Only USDT remains stable, and I still stay away from it because people have me spooked.

I was making such progress, I more than tripled my money in over a week but now for the past couple of days I have to just watch it slowly go down. Will it even get back up to 1100 like it was before? Will the trades start up again or am I screwed? I thought I had found a viable way to make money, my gains would have gotten higher over time due to compounding. The last couple of days have just killed my morale.CoinCapture is just the start of a much larger project!

LTC: LXSbCrFXYieywi256DTUftAaaRaDbvYdGt    December and January have been crazy months. It was such a magical moment, euphoria was absolute. However, **things should be put in perspective**. I remember when we hit $500 for the first time, it was totally crazy. It was like WHAT'S GOING ON?  As I write this message, ETH is at $685. Everything is FINE. You don't believe me about the $500 hype ? 2 months ago, a random guy has predicted that ETH will reach $500 by **March 2018** and has been mainly upvoted. Some random guys (like me) were even trolling about $1k by March 2018. Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7czdor/is_ethereum_preparing_grounds_for_a_new_ath_i/

Guys, we reached &gt;$1400. A major correction had to happen. Perhaps you bought your first ETHs at &gt;$1k. But if you bought after having done your due diligence and invested what you can afford to lose, just keep cool. Nothing has changed, the tech is still there. If you really believe in that technology, stop watching your potential losses. As long as you don't sell, this whole mess is hypothetical.

Stop watching this god damn price, HODL if you really believe in ETH (and not because this random friend or colleague made $500k in 1 year with crypto) and chill out.

I wish you all the best!To give you a clearer idea, Nucleus vision has put together this video that explains how they are aiming to capture data &amp; the layers that power the Nucleus Vision ecosystem.

website: https://www.nucleus.vision/The moment ETH/USD shows signs of reversal in the face of BTC/USD dropping the flippening will happen quickly.

Im very bullish long term from eth, this is a substantial drop though for the entire crypto community.

Whatre the chances this is the bubble bursting and we wont see 1k for another 6 months+ or is this just an over correction from the rediculous bull run?

I realize no one can answer beyond raw speculation but Id like to see some opinions and reasons why, Ill be fine either wayThe move on ethereum is taking us back to 2017. The funny thing is that was only last December. With all the upgrades coming it's like ethereum is on sale right now. I am bullish still. Wish I had cash sitting around to buy. First things first: I got into ETH in early 2017 and have bought in many times since then, but I've been avoiding selling any this entire time, partially because, duh, but also because I know that things involving capital gains taxes come into play once I do.

At the very basic core, what do I need to know for that fateful day when I do decide to sell some Ether? Things like dates/times of transactions? Prices at the time? Exchanges that I sold from, e.g. Coinbase?

Thanks in advance, and hope everyone is still breathing after today's dips. Happy HODLing!Hello, I was just wondering about this downtrend in eth and icos. (I am copying my post from NapoleonX sub where I might have limited answers as it is inactive, but also the situation holds for other icos. Lets use them for example for this thoretical question. You can find their website for reference: https://www.napoleonx.ai/ - this is not an ad nor a fud). Let's say at the start of the ico eth price was 1000$ and at the end it is around 500$, will ico investors get 1000 npx tokens at both times? (as clearly stated on the website 1eth = 1000npx) If so, given the soft cap and hard cap that are in usd (10m and 15m respectively), they would need more eth than initially accounted for, so how can the total number of tokens be a fixed amount of 50m and stay distributed as budgeted for on the website? Just curious, maybe im missing something here. Cheers!**Problem:**
  Every time when there are big fluctuations in the Coin Market Cap, most of the coins are going UP or DOWN in the same way. Be informed and act accordingly (for example, when it goes DOWN: you can move into other stable currencies or withdraw; etc.) 

&amp;nbsp;

**Recommendation:**
  I recommend you the **CMC Alert** app, as it gives you the information that you need regarding the Coin Market Cap in a user friendly way, it's simple, efficient and FREE. CMC Alert uses the official Web API from coinmarketcap.com.
Why should you use it:

+ It's a lot faster than going on coinmarketcap.com.

- It's a hidden notification, only way to see it is if you drag your notification tab down, you don't even know it's there, hack your wife would never know that you are constantly checking the cap.

* It's free and requires no permissions so it's safe.

Google Play link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.companyname.CMCAlert .

&amp;nbsp;

**Description:**
  CMC Alert is an app that pins notifications to your mobile notification bar and which displays information regarding the total market cap of crypto coins .

- The notifications are still running in background, so you can close the app and use only the controls of notification from the notification mobile bar !

- Alerts you when the price goes down or up and displays the change percentage since the last update.

- **Set Alarms** with different conditions, choose sound, vibrate, recurring or just notification option for it;

- **Aggressive Alarm mode**(optional) - perfect when you want to be awake during nights

&amp;nbsp;

It helps me everyday, why not try it yourself! It's also free. :) So I usually use Turbo Tax to do my taxes since it's quick and easy. However, this year I have over 2k trades to report. I used bitcoin.tax to get my overall gain/loss and that's fine, but I'll have to submit a report of each trade with values and buy/sell prices. 

These were easy enough to pull from coinbase/GDAX using bitcoin.tax but the problem I'm running into is that I can't upload a csv file or een a turbo tax txf to the standard or premium turbo tax app/websites. 

Any traders out there use software or methods I'm not aware of or am I going to have to actually find a tax professional who knows how to file this stuff (I live in a rural setting).https://www.banking.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/d6c0f0b6-757d-4916-80fd-a43315228060/A2A6C1D8DDBB7AD33EBE63254D80E9E3.giancarlo-testimony-2-6-18b.pdf

Source :https://twitter.com/TusharJain_/status/960614899499053056Anyone following crypto markets for a decent time easily notices all the signals of coordination:

1. Multiple regulatory agencies in different countries releasing vaguely bearish news about crackdowns on something crypto-related, releasing clarifications a few days later on how it is meaningless

2. One or two big celebrity financiers dump on crypto in public statements

3. Usual "thought-leading" publications do their best Fred Sanford impersonation "This is the big one, Ethel!"

4. All the no-coiners applaud at the new fodder to rationalize their poor past decisions to not invest/adopt crypto

It isn't a surprise that a lot of BTC hodlers would take profits at $20k, or that the market would finally mature and realize there are cryptos outside the Bitsphere that have more utility and more functionality at cheaper use costs. We know a lot of investment into BTC itself was hoping for a quick cash-in on the Ponzis like Bitconnect. And we know that external futures markets for BTC just went online, attracting every bad actor in finance to crypto manipulation. So the drop in BTC really wasn't unexpected, and there's little reason for it to effect the rest of the crypto market essentially. But for the next few days you're going to see the short sellers place as much pressure as they can on the price of cryptos with bad news and hysteria-mongering.

But watch what's happening in the rest of the economy. There is a big selloff in stocks right now and that is a lot of free cash that will be looking for a new place to invest. The current dip in crypto seems like a perfect time for people to cash out of overpriced stocks (especially of companies that crytpo makes obsolete) and move into blockchain.Stock market started crashing ...

Cryptocurrency market is crashing as well ...

Is this the begining of the recession that we were hearing about for a while ?

What pushes the big banks to not allow their clients to buy cryptocurrencies with credit cards but not their debit cards ? Too many defaulted payments from people who lost their money during January's drop ?

Let's discuss ...

I see a lot of people panic selling these days, you are getting a piece of shit in exchange for real gold xD, never sell your ether... For real, you will be let with nothing but regret, I can tell you that as an experienced holder...

Also, don't panic looking at the sell orders on any exchange, you think everybody is selling? Just about the 3% of the total ether is being traded globally, and just that small amount is determining the price of all the network, also don't fall for marketcap, marketcap is not correlated to the real valuation of any token... When you are selling or buying, you think you are fighting against other people matching lower prices, but all you are doing is fighting with bots, LOL, sell wisely...

Since the first time I buy I decided my ethereum was worth at least 5k each, how much is yours valued? It's up to you, but after I've used the ethereum network mine got valuated at that price with current tech...Just a little fact, people is getting 100+ Millions in ICOS with just buying your cheap ether and deploying a contract...Isn't ETH the reward for providing computing power to the network? So isn't the point to provide gas, claim the reward, and pay off the energy bills and reap some profit off your contribution? Like does ETH have to go up if more dapps are added? The people running them would have to have revenue. They couldn't just contribute time and energy forever without withdrawing to Fiat or a true currency. 

Don't be mad, be informative. I am a small time hodler, but not well versed in the technical stuff. With this crazy drop in Bitcoin some other coins were hit a lot harder even. The **DAO PlayMarket 2.0** ended its ICO (**PMT token**) end of December selling one PMT for 0.2 ETH. The entire ICO phase ranged from 0.12 ETH per PMT token up to 0.2 ETH per PMT token ([source](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/dao-playmarket-2-0/)). In the last days with this current market **PMT is listed now 60% to 80% below its initial ICO**, which was with $5 million quite successful.

  

Here is my research on PMT:

  

**First, the basics  what is it anyway:**

- Providing the first decentralized Android app store based on crypto

- Including an unrivaled, built-in ICO platform for app developers

- Active development team with regular updates via Facebook, Twitter, Videos as well as coding on Github

- Roadmap available  with over one year of already accomplished development topics

  

**Second, from an ICO / token perspective:**

- ERC20 token with very limited supply of only 3 million token

- ICO from 0.12 ETH to 0.2 ETH ended successfully ($5 million reached)

- 75% were offered in crowdsale, which is a large percentage compared to other coins. The project teams tokens are frozen for 24 month.

- **Listing on Yobit, Bittrex and Bitfinex  [(twitter)](https://twitter.com/en_playmarket2) have been requested**, making it accessible to a much larger audience shortly

  

**Third, from an investor perspective:**

- **Dividends payment**: Holders of PMT tokens automatically become co-owners of the platform-based DAO PlayMarket Foundation, which takes a 5% cut from developers releasing their own token (ICO) on the platform. From this, dividends will be paid out on pro-rata basis (to PMT token holders)

- Potential app market: **Entering an Android app market of $20 billion**. This is just the expected 3rd party appstore market (meaning the market share of the current top providers, like like googles app store, are not even included in this)  [source](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/29/app-annie-android-to-top-ios-in-app-store-revenue-this-year)

- Project was able to convince initial investors and partners (e.g. BitBaza) and received 350k investment capital

- Like in other app stores, developers do not receive a salary by the platform provider, but are selling their own developed app through the platform. Hence the platform gets a free growth and the store can scale freely through its network of developers. For developers a 1% commission is very attractive (compared to 30% in other stores)

  

For early investors you will need to go the EtherDelta route, or wait for listing on the other exchanges mentioned above: 

[https://etherdelta.com/#0xc1322d8ae3b0e2e437e0ae36388d0cfd2c02f1c9-eth](https://etherdelta.com/#0xc1322d8ae3b0e2e437e0ae36388d0cfd2c02f1c9-eth).

Or, if you are familiar, ForkDelta also lists it:

[https://forkdelta.github.io/#!/trade/0xc1322d8ae3b0e2e437e0ae36388d0cfd2c02f1c9-ETH]( https://forkdelta.github.io/#!/trade/0xc1322d8ae3b0e2e437e0ae36388d0cfd2c02f1c9-ETH)

  

Further information on the DAO Playmarket 2.0 you can also find on their official site:

Let me know your thoughts on this project
Is there a good website that will show me the historical price of an ALT vs. ETH on a given day?

Pretty much what coinmarketcap does for an ALT vs BTC. 

ThanksThinking it is a dip and it will recover, where do you set the lowest price? idk, for instance, 300? Any opinion? Any reason?As the title suggests, i'm curious as to where I can safely sell ETH. I've been recommended Kraken, although i've heard a good mix of a lot of love and hate towards them.. so as a precaution, I figured i'd ask here to see what others think, if I could get a better place to sell my ETH at besides Kraken, etc.

Anyone here they could help me regarding those questions?

Thanks to those who try to!Just a reminder that this is not the first time we've seen losses of 50% or more. Pulling data from coinmarketcap.com:

* Bitcoin hit a high of $147.49 on 4/29/13 and a low of $65.53 on 7/5/13, for a total drop of **-56%**.
* Bitcoin hit a high of $1156.12 on 12/4/13, and a low of $171.51 on 1/14/15, for a total drop of **-85%**.
* Ether hit a hit of $3.54 on 8/7/15, and a low of $0.42 on 10/22/15, for a total drop of **-88%**.
* Ether hit a high of $15.79 on 6/22/16, and a low of $5.98 on 12/6/16, for a total drop of **-62%**.
* Ether hit a high of $414.76 on 6/12/17, and a low of $133.72 on 7/16/17, for a total drop of **-68%**.

How does that compare to our current market?

Bitcoin hit a high of $20,089 on 12/17/17 and is currently at $6,756.03, for a drop of **-66%**.

Ether hit a high of $1417.38 on 1/10/18 and is currently at $657.12, for a drop of **-54%**.

This is not the end of the world. We'll make it through this. 

Hodl strong my friends."I used to be [a Bitcoin maximalist]. I'm not any longer."

"With Bitcoin you buy it or you don't. It goes up or it doesn't. But in Ethereum ... your play is on the success of all the projects on top of it. "

"There aren't really any projects that use Bitcoin as a substrate ... If you care about eco system plays, a substrate which you can layer other stuff and if that other stuff succeeds the other thing becomes valuable, Ethereum has that. If cryptokitties takes off, Ethereum is going to go up in value. If one of the one hundred or two hundred projects in Ethereum takes off, Ethereum is going to go up in value. "

Because we're tied to BTC's price, we're all doomed. This has to stop. FIAT pairs for all cryptocoins would be more fair! Why can't we organize a serious petition? I'm frustrated and I know many here are tooHello everyone, it's u/dmorasch16 here with Ethereum News Network's financial report. We have great news coming in today from the markets, as the price of Ether has dropped 20% AGAIN over the last 24 hours, making Ether even CHEAPER! Since the most expensive price of over 1400 US dollars, Ether has become over 50% more affordable, giving any investor with the correct mindset an excellent opportunity to get in cheap on this amazing technology. I personally have been putting every spare dollar towards buying ether, as there's no telling how long these prices could last. Some analysts are even more optimistic than I, predicting the price could drop as low as $500 in the next week or two. Let's hope they're right, as it would be excellent news for any would-be investors. And now, over to Matt with the weather.I'm looking for an exchange in the UK that will let me buy 10 worth as a test. The value is low now so I can sell later when ethereum recovers.Upcoming Feb 6 meeting between SEC and CFTC to discuss crypto and how gov should deal with it moving forward. Many seem scared about what might come out of this meeting, although there could be good to come from it. We just have to wait and see what happens.

The bitconnect ponzi and ensuing lawsuit which specifically names youtube shillers. This trial is going to be messy, as under US tax law, anyone who made any money from a ponzi has to pay that money back to be pooled for distribution among the entire group. Still too fresh in people's minds.

Banks blocking purchases with credit cards. Removed a millions of dollars worth of instant liquidity for buyers and this took a ton of money off the table for buys. Although in the long run, this should strengthen the market.Just tried to buy Eth on Coinbase, and both my cards blocked the transaction after an initial success message. Citi and Chase Bank.

Is there a list of cards that do and don't still work? Anyone have success with a CC? Anyone have a debit card blocked?Is there any information about how non-fiat exchanges are realizing profits from fees and how they are switching this to fiat, for example to pay costs, employees etc? ? For example bittrex or poloniex? They are earning nice amounts of btc, eth, usdt and alts each day. They just convert this to BTC or ETH and sells on kraken, gdax, gemini?  
Is Janet Yellen running this meeting?! ..this feels like the day before a Fed minutes release .. people holding their breath to see which way the wind will blow.  The SEC/CFTC's 'oversight role' will hopefully result in minimal common sense regulation.This is what crypto is all about. Welcome folks. HUGE raises, unbelievable. But then, PAINFUL drops. 

This is why we cheer so much when a bull run happens, but brace together when the sky is dark. Some of us don't last long, but those who do become more strong. 

At times like this we ALL wonder, was this the last bull run? Is it over for sure? Was it too big this time? But then it just happens all over again, and after the rain comes the sun. 

T0ny
I just bought some eth on coinbase and after receiving the confirmation that it was successful, received an email saying it was cancelled by the bank.  Not a lack of funds issue.

Anyone know if wells is joining the crypto ban? I tried ACH and CC.
You are falling for the same divide/conquer strategy and belittling strategy the big banks/media complex uses

Time to come together for decentralized crypto as an asset class. China news to me is a welcome CHERRY on TOP to signal to me to increase my bullishness, yes, bullishness, not bearishness on the blue chip coins

BUY LOW and HOLD.  If you want to puke up your porfolio so the banks and institutions can buy it, feel free, but you ain't a friend to the cause. This whole month of fud was about removing the marginal moon buyers who came in since December so they could get back in for the year. 

PLAY the LONG GAME, I implore you. This is more than about trading.

BTC is actually developing and will become the large amount transfer instrument globally

ETH is the UNICORN that can do so much and is CANI: constant and never ending improvement as TR would say

BCH will get into colored coins and do very well eventually

LTC  is a steal here

So many positives, i know, you can't talk bullishness in months like this!!!

Please unite, we are fighting forces entrenched to fuck you and your family infinitely. A recent ZH article showed how the big banks didnt pass on 1 fucking interest rate increase to savers in their bank accounts. You are buying their rigged dollar and system everytime you shit on crypto after the crash. The trolls walking around with glee, some even gold/conservative bugs, makes ME SICK


Edit: almost all the replies except 1 were positive. Pretty sick guys. All Chinese exchanges are registered in Hong Kong where their operations are fully approved. All their clients outside of HK use vpn.

Waltonchain  An Odyssey: Brutal Tales of FOMO &amp; FUD from the Digital Tip of the American Dream, where entire mortgages are gambled on ephemeral Chinese tech and huge swathes of sweaty-palmed maniacs congregate in chatrooms like slime around stagnant water, each screaming incomprehensible gibberish into the darkened moonless sky above, praying to The Great Lono that Walton rises mid-to-late October and their collective bills can be paid, if not on time, then in high-interest instalments leveraged against the very Soul of their youngest child.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I am, strangely, a naturally optimistic man. Despite years of academia and indoctrination into the bowels of a respectable professional career; married life and mortgage payments of sizable sums, of life insurance policies and the death of my dog the day before my 15th birthday; I still find myself charged with a degree of positivity that belittles the actuality of the situation around us, where never-ending Global War reigns supreme and civil liberties are eroded, insidiously, by fuckpigs and their salaried speech writers. In spite of these daily frictions; these undercurrents of heavy doom and harbingers of cultural malaise; I retain a buoyant optimism in these dark seas of cultural maelstrom where white caps billow and smash down hard on all those caught beneath the breaking waves of modern progress. I preserve a steady confidence by bearing in mind the One True Wisdom of Olde: that no cunt, nowhere, knows whats going on.
 
&amp;nbsp;

What has become quite clear to me over the last few months is the absolute necessity to disregard the thoughts, musings, innuendo, derisory howls and colourfully-annotated technical analyses of Other People. Apparently necessitated by the lack of knowledge inherent to this infant technology  a deep void of echoes where nothing dwells but guesswork and prediction  parroted clichs are myriad in the world of cryptocurrency. From a Warren Buffet quote concerning greed and fear, which is eagerly strung out by all-and-sundry like glistening ropes of semen along the facial contours of naive young bukakke-starlets; to Baron Rothschilds blood in the streets. People are seemingly fixated, almost erotically so, on throwing empty frivolities across chaotic chatroom airspace in the hope that someone, somewhere, will take note.
 
&amp;nbsp;

We are at the precipice of the future, a bleeding-edge where technology and economics meet; a collision of binary code, global awareness and enough money to buy platinum dildos for all the whores in Old Saigon.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I can only, at this juncture, reiterate: no cunt, nowhere, knows whats going on.
 
&amp;nbsp;

The unravelling chaos of crypto brings to mind an un-qualified myth I saw messily scrawled on the inside facing of a toilet cubicle door in a New Orleans jazz club, directly below a crayon etching of LeRoi Jones: The term cool, in its original context, meant a specific reaction to the world; a specific relationship to ones environment. It defined an attitude which actually existed. To be cool was, in its most accessible meaning, to be calm, even unimpressed, by what horror the world might daily propose.
 
&amp;nbsp;

As things stand, there is no definitive point to this semi-coherent digressive on the quaint nuances of digital currency and the weird, clueless, malevolent, beautiful, ordinary people who inhabit slack channels, reddit threads and WeChat-based-PnD-Groups the world over.
 
&amp;nbsp;

We collectively find ourselves here via innumerable mountainous routes, hellfire passes and hidden gates behind overgrown vacant lots; but the reason were all here is quite simple: money. We aim to make money, not for moneys sake, but for the sake of Ultimate Escape. To unchain ourselves from the machinery of the world and let loose, unbridled, like a fantastic North Korean firework; glowing plutonium green and exploding over the Sea of Japan to widespread political condemnation.
 
&amp;nbsp;

It would be easy, though unfair, to suggest that the Nine-to-Five grind does nothing to enhance my passage through this life. It does, after all, finance my iron-rich diet of creative technologies and shamanic medicines; without which I would surely wither and die. This being the case, one must always endeavour to strike a fine balance between Work and Life; only bending over and quietly accepting the blue-veined meat-package when utterly essential to the overall plan; when the last distress flare has been fired high into the midnight sky, all telephone lines severed, and the radio smashed to pieces by marauding corporate brutes.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I feel strongly that Real Work can never be achieved in the workplace, and Nine-to-Five, Monday through Friday, is my penance for the hunting of Dreams. An unsightly filler. The annoying background noise during another late-night recital by my choir of Personal Angels. A necessary evil; maligned, resented, but tolerated as a temporary contractual obligation. A saddening fact of life is that without Serious Cash, we will never be able to escape the deadening clutches of Paid Work.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Crypto, for this generation, provides a chance to do so. A sliver of hope for unparalleled riches. The vast majority of investors are in exactly the same boat. A global collection of Dreamers, Traders, Gamblers and Digital Vagrants; tipping our hats to the karmic gods of Fate and Fortune.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Above all else, when reddit pages and slack channels are abruptly swollen with rampant crazies, maniacal deviants and hideous trolls with nothing to add but fear and uncertainty; one should remain grounded, solidly, in the knowledge that the words of Others arent worth the faecal matter theyre hastily scrawled in; that no cunt, nowhere, knows whats going on.
 
&amp;nbsp;

In crypto, as in life; be cool and unimpressed with what horror the world might daily propose.

&amp;nbsp;

In Walton We Trust.

Especially when taking into consideration the latest news coming out of China re: banning foreign exchanges and going after miners. Porting mining over to POS will bring about the great decoupling as Eths fortunes will truly no longer be beholden to miners using cheap Chinese electricity and the whims of the Chinese government. Big believer over herebullish. I understand the market is currently having a flash crash, but as Bitcoin falls. shouldnt ETH and LTC be "a safe haven" for people who no longer believe in the outdated tech of Bitcoin? Can anyone ELI5 why ETH and LTC seems to be pegged to Bitcoin when you can buy ETH and LTC with fiat? Hence it makes no sense that prices of ETH and LTC should drop along side with Bitcoin.

3.A stunning and exceptionally rare Cartier Mystery / Prism clock. In sterling silver with a quartz movement and circa 1980s. This particular model, circa 10cm / 4 in high, is based on the much smaller Art Deco manual movement version. A fascinating item which when viewed head on seems empty, and then by the use of mirrors the clock face is revealed when looked at it from slightly above. This item has a retail value of 14,000 / $19,600

9.Winners will have to take part in a video interview following their win which MyOddz.bet will be free to use in any way we see fit.These mods are even circlejerks and only want positive price related news...... what a joke. 
Even more reason for teh price to go down, it just takes longer for teh news to filter down....Every time we run into a bearish market, the sub is flooded with drama talk, FUD, HODL strong etc. I love this sub, I love the daily thread, I love memes and cuecumbers but it's time to sober up. 

The last months were full of FOMO and fresh money that has entered this fairly young market full of projects with a lot of potential. But the emphasis is mainly still on the word "potential". Now it's the time for all those projects to deliver some results. The ETH foundation needs to make the biggest challenge of all happen: scaling. If this challenge is mastered, then the real potential is unleashed. And only then the whole speculation might turn into a solid ground for moon talk.

Other projects need to deliver too. I strongly believe in projects, who have more than only a whitepaper and fancy website, but a solid team, existing connections to the real world economy or even a physical product. These projects will obviously have better chances to succeed than many of those vaporware products. And yes in the end it's our decision to rate and decide (and of course gamble a bit) which of these projects might succeed.

Good luck and god bless the blockchain! :D


 Check  out the Flippening website. Google searches for Bitcoin dwarf Ethereum. 

The whole market is linked to Bitcoins reputation, and we are going to dip while it falls away. The next rise will be based on our legitimate value, rather than their beautiful but fundamentally flawed visionI think its a concern. The sugar jar is being emptied out from the inside. Investors are withdrawing money and there is not enough capital to refill the market. Winter could be comingWhere can I find the list of exchanges which support EUR pairs, what are the most popular options? 

I've used Kraken before, but not keen on continuing since it had huge problems with orders getting cancelled most of the time I tried to post anything, for unexplained technical reasons. And they also removed all advanced orders options so there is that too.

Just checked GDAX and I can't use it because my country isn't in the supported list.I am new to trading. Can I sell eth when the value is high and then buy it with the same money when the value drops, then keep doing it? Will this strategy make a profit?I need to find an ethereum exchange in the UK that I can buy eth with pounds and exchange back into pounds that pays the transfer fees. The only time I've ever traded was when I bought bitcoin for 20 from CoinCorner and I lost a lot in the transfer fees.Will ICO this month.
