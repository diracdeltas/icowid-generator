          White Paper 2017 | Ver 1.0
The purpose of this paper is to describe the concept of an in- ternational blockchain* lottery, its principles and the business rules which support its techni- cal implementation, as well the prize fund constitution, the mar- keting plan including the refer- ral program, and the Token sale.It will address all relevant aspects related to the development, pro- motion and operation of the sys- tem in the international market. * — A blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records called blocks. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modi cation of the data — once recorded, the data in a block cannot be altered retroactively. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain© 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 2

 Summary           True Flip is a blockchain lottery platform. We have already developed a bitcoin-based and fair-proof lottery 6/49 (Powerball*) and plan to make at least 3 more lottery games. It is the  rst stage of the development and we have done half the work already.In order to ful ll our mission in the best possible way we are making the whole lottery fully transparent: every ticket sold, every win, all the token holder rewards distributed and  nancial results will be published on the blockchain.The second goal is to make True Flip platform as decentralized as virtually possible. We also intend to use decentralized hosting and multiple data centers so that discontinuation of one of them would have no effect on the platform in general.The third, probably the most ambitious goal is to create a platform which could be used by private companies, charitable foundations and even governments to set up any kind of lotteries. Further details are set forth in this Whitepaper.As the  rst step, we plan to create True Flip tokens which will grant their holders an access to daily rewards and entitle them to vote on the lottery’s future development. We will also launch a Token Sale in order to distribute 70% of all True Flip tokens within the community. The team will own 20% of the tokens to remain motivated to keep on developing the project. The remaining 10% will be used to pay for advisers, escrow and bounty services. All unsold tokens will be burned.There will be 21`000`000 of the TFL Tokens issued at the rate of 0.0005 BTC per 1 Token. During the ICO 14`700`000 Tokens will be put on sale. 10 to 15% of the ticket sales revenues will be proportionally distributed between all the TFL Token holders.True Flip Group SRL is incorporated in Costa Rica, which of cially allows online gambling.Trueflip.io website contains Terms & conditions, Public offer, Privacy Policy and Referral System Agreement.© 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 4
 1. Introduction           Gambling market overviewAccording to H2 Gambling Capital (www.h2gc.com), the casino business was a major revenue contributor to the offline gambling market in 2016. In money equivalent, it accounted for $132.8 billion with a 37% market share. The lottery segment occupied 30.9% (or $111 billion), followed by slot machines with 19.3% (or $69.4 billion).Income structure of global offline gambling business in 2016 (bln US Dollars and %)    3 37311019 Bingo $9.6 / 3% Betting $36.5 / 10%  Slot machines $69.4 / 19% Lottery $111.0 / 31% Casino $132.8 / 37%    When it comes to the online gambling market, there were certain differences. The leader was Betting, with a 48.7% market share ($21.4 billion). It was followed by casino business and lotteries. Each with 26.8% ($11.8 billion) and 8.8% ($3.85 billion), respectively.As online lottery has an added value and low market share in comparison to offline lottery, it seems that this segment has strong market potential in the future.© 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 5

As can be seen from the graph below, both offline and online markets are gradually grow- ing. It is notable that online gambling is increasing with a higher growth rate in comparison with offline one.According to the H2 Gambling Capital forecast, the offline gambling industry will occupy only 11.5% of the overall market revenue, whereas online one will keep increasing in the future. It is expected that revenues from the online gambling market will exceed $60 billion by 2020, at a compound annual growth rate of around 10%.© 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 6

Until recently, only several resources accepted Bitcoins, but today its integration into payment systems has become ubiquitous.Many participants of the online gambling market believe that the cryptocurrencies will continue to occupy this industry. This mostly happens due to its lower regulators control relative to  at money for both players and online operators. Other advantages include:- no need to identify users;- no restrictions on the amount of transactions; - acceleration of payments;- lowering the minimum payment threshold.It looks like cryptocurrencies are turning into the most reliable, transparent and pro table medium of circu- lation for the online gambling industry. Soon the online casinos on blockchain will become as familiar as the Internet.With the advent of blockchain technology, which gives transparency and cross-border dimension to the whole industry, it became possible to make an honest international lottery. Moreover, thanks to the new trend of smart contracts for Ethereum, this lottery can belong to the community and not to a handful of stakeholders.© 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 7
 1. Introduction           So, when we talk about a lottery based on blockchain technology, we are talking about linking the wide lottery participation in the whole gambling market to the constant and signi cant growth of Bitcoin’s* share in the global  nancial market.    Fifth of population Bitcoin market capitalization partake in lotteries is $21.1 bln. 150% growth in2016$12.5 Million bitcoin wallets registered on Blockhain.info$218 bln. spent on lotteries throughout the world in 2016                Combined, those trends bring about brand new opportunities for online gambling, especially considering the increasing number of networked devices and the number of users who prefer to play online and anonymously.Despite the turnover and the prevalence of lotteries as one of the most important games in the world, there are numerous problems concerning fair play due to the issues surrounding the raffles and the awards.As was mentioned above, presently a large number of issues involving prize distribution and fairness of raffles are observed, which becomes even worse when associated with the dif culty of receiving the prize and the high fees and taxes involved.However, with the massive use of blockchain technology, we  nally have the opportunity to solve these old problems, bringing about the complete and total transparency of all the operations involving the True Flip plat- form as the main change and the most important advantage.On True Flip platform, all lottery issues such as ticket purchase, random number generation for betting and draws, prize fund composition, prize tickets veri cation, prize distribution and other operations are 100% im- plemented using blockchain technology and open source code available on GitHub**. TrueFlip token (TFL) holders are entitled to enforce any changes suggested for the platform.* — Bitcoin is both a cryptocurrency and an electronic payment system invented by an unidenti ed programmer, or group of programmers, under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was introduced on 31 October 2008 to a cryptog- raphy mailing list, and released as open-source software in 2009. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin** — https://github.com/TrueFlip/prizecounter/blob/master/algorithm.py © 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 8
 1. Introduction           MissionLotteries give a chance to dramatically change one’s life for the better. This chance has always drawn the attention of millions of people around the world for the past 500 years, giving them hope to improve their  nancial condition.True Flip’s goal is to become the most popular and transparent blockchain lottery that belongs to international community and offers the biggest Jackpot in the world.Most of currently existing lotteries are totally centralized or even held by governments and are hardly trans- parent. Our mission is to build True Flip as a provably fair and decentralized lottery platform that neither any nation state, nor a single authority, nor members of our team could control.We also take into account the following points on the way to our goal:- Online gambling is recognized as the fastest-growing sector in the industry;- The synergy of the cryptocurrencies and gambling market opens up new opportunities for projects in this industry;- The size of the lottery market in the offline sector is about € 100 billion, while in the online sector it is only about € 3.5 billion;- By combining the advantages of Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies (as a means of payment), we will be able to seize the market share from classic lotteries by turning their disadvantages into our possibili- ties.© 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 9
 2. Operating scheme           True Flip is the international anonymous lottery based on the blockchain technology with instant payouts and the source code of the winning combination is publicly available.Our game looks the same as any ordinary lottery (for example Powerball): you guess  ve numbers between 1 and 49 and one number between 1 and 26. We decided to signi cantly increase the probability of winning by reducing the total quantity of numbers from 75 to 49, which makes the chance of winning 1.3 times higher than in Powerball. After that, our system randomly draws six numbered balls and the whole process is totally transparent.However, these are all similarities to classic lotteries. Our advantage comes from the fact that our lottery is fully based on Bitcoin blockchain. Everything concerning draw process must be transparent to every user and exclude any possibility of meddling with results. We applied those advanced IT technologies to completely overhaul the rules of the game that had not seen any major changes for almost 500 years. Our goal is to make it more convenient, open, fair, and valuable.How does the draw take place and why is it transparent?The Trueflip.io lottery system works by taking the  rst block in blockchain which  ts in the technical require- ments that appears after 8:00 p.m. UTC (which is impossible to know in advance, because last ticket for the draw cannot be purchased after 7:30 p.m. UTC) and plugs it into the algorithm, which can be found on Github, to generate the six numbers for the upcoming drawing. This process repeats for every draw at 8:00 p.m. every day. The full explanation about the process can be watched on Youtube* or read in an article in Trueflip’s of-  cial Medium Blog**.Because it is a lottery based on blockchain, it is possible to obtain several advantages, applying advanced technologies to completely transform the way the game is processed:- Any person from any place in the world should be able to sign in to our lottery without providing any private information;- The draw process is operated by open-source software. This excludes any possibility of the project’s team of interfering with the draw process.;- Prize payouts are executed instantly, no third parties involved. All payments are shown in the open blockchain ledger and any player may make sure that we’ve given all prizes in full concordance with lottery rules.- All transactions are reflected in the open registry (blockchain) and any user can monitor payment pro- cessing all the time.With that, one needs no ID, licence, or registration to work with Bitcoin - it’s enough just to create a wallet (on Blockchain.info, for example). In fact, the Bitcoin network is accessible to everybody connected to the Inter- net. This monetary system, as well as our lottery which is Bitcoin-based and works pursuant to the same rules, is one of the most friendly and open technologies today.* — https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUeULQ7BxXI** — https://medium.com/@trueflip/verifying-trueflip-winning-combinations-cc28a3e0e176 © 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 10
 2. Operating scheme           All those features enable us to provide quality entertainment to any user that wants to test their luck on a daily basis by playing in the lottery, as well as make Trueflip the number one blockchain lottery in the Bitcoin community.Distribution of the prize fundThe system automatically converts every payment to bitcoin and transfers funds to the prize fund of the lot- tery. The platform prize fund is transparent and always open for viewing due to blockchain technology, and accounts for 60% of the ticket cost. (for more information about the distribution of the ticket sales revenue, see the Business model section).A bet wins when numbers of the ticket match the numbers of the winning set according to the table below. MATCH PRIZE PROBABILITYJackpot30% *20% *1 BTC ($2528.86) 0,5 BTC ($1264.43) 0,5 BTC ($1264.44) 0.025 BTC ($63.22) 0.005 BTC ($12.64) 0.003 BTC ($7.59) 0.001 BTC ($2.53)1 : 49 504 950 1 : 1 984 127 1 : 225 225 1 : 9 0141 : 5 2411 : 3741 : 2101 : 731 : 462 : 49                                                                 Winnings in these categories are determined after calculation of winnings with  xed prizes. The payout fund is the difference between the amount of the prize fund of the run and amount payable for  xed-prize winnings.The Jackpot is initially formed at the ICO stage and is re lled by the lottery tickets being sold.For more information about the lottery process and winnings distribution see section 9 (Lottery features).© 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 11
 3. Business model           TrueFlip offers a transparent business model for TFL Token holders. Every sold ticket, winnings, withdrawals, bonuses and operational expenses will be open for every TFL token holder and recorded onto the blockchain, so it will not change.The main service that generates TrueFlip’s pro ts is ticket sales. The structure below shows how cash flow is assigned to main areas of expenditures. Ticket structureInvestors 10-15%* Operations* — Proof of community. All decisions will be made by token holders votings.Marketing strategy 15 000 sold tickets per day   15-20%*Marketing BudgetReferral Program   5-10%*Tickets Fixed price 0.001 BTC60%2%* JACKPOTThe ticket price comprises 0.001 BTC or its Ethereum or Litecoins equivalent. Our basic forecast suggests 15`000 sold tickets per day. This number accounts for only 0.4% of the global online-gambling market in cur- rent prices. After the launch of three new lotteries, the daily turnover in our model might reach 50`000 sold tickets (1.3% of the world market).After a player buys a ticket, the funds will be distributed as follows: 1. 60%goesstraighttotheJackpot2. 15-20%* for marketing3. 5-10%* for operations4. 2% - referral awards5. 10-15%* to the token holders* This spread depends on policy, that will be agreed with all TFL token holders via voting on said issues.© 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 12
 4. Marketing strategy           Since May 10, 2017, when our marketing strategy started, we have achieved some stats: daily traf c is more than 35,000 visitors*, more than 18`000+ tickets played daily, and overall winning of 12.3 BTC. In order to stim- ulate the steady growth of the platform, users can participate in one or more speci c promotion campaigns accordingly with their user pro le and the desired extent of their involvement.Marketing plan+++Referral program Partnership networks World’s best bloggers Offline partners 450M + views every month1. All players can spread the word about this innovative lottery platform and invite friends and other players using their personal referral link. After your referred friends sign up on TrueFlip, both you and them get a free ticket to start playing. Users will receive 2% of their referred players’ winnings on an ongoing basis (including the Jackpot!). This feature is also implemented without human involvement and is part of the marketing strategy called “Friends’ Winnings”. Thus, True Flip users continuously remain interested in invit- ing other players to the platform, because each guest ends up increasing the chances of winning in each new draw.2. Another deep marketing strategy consists in joining a partnership network, which is a technological plat- form connecting advertisers and partners, ensuring  nancial and informational interaction between them. Any kind of business organizations get an opportunity of holding advertising campaigns online. On the other hand, media partners get instruments for selection and deployment of advertising offers. We are also developing a widget for quick lottery tickets purchase on the websites of our partners.3. Giventheimportanceofawell-de nedmarketingplan,itisimpossibletoignoretheincreaseinthenumber of Internet users around the world and the effect that blogs and specialised sites have on those users. De- spite the huge number of pages on the most varied platforms, the list of most influential pages practically does not change, varying only the local classi cation between them. This characteristic allows us to easily identify the most effective media to run public campaigns. We will also use the power of social networks and their tools in our marketing strategy.4. In addition, we intend to conduct various media advertising, PR-campaigns, off-line activities in different regions and non-standard advertising through the attraction of off-line partners.Concerning the marketing budget, it is expensive but effective to achieve 250,000+ users per day. However, this detailed plan is sup- ported by  nancial resources previously set forth in the platform’s fund-sharing strategy. All reports will be fully transparent for the Token holders.* — http://imgur.com/a/cXFiT         © 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 13

 6. Token Sale           First of all, what differs True Flip’s Token sale from other ICO’s and Token sales is that we have already made the product, as opposed to others who just promise to develop something in the future.Why do we still need to sell Tokens?Here are the main issues:1. Jackpot. A lottery is interesting only if there is a BIG Jackpot. For a powerful launch we are planning to raise 1`960 BTC for Jackpot via Token Sale campaign. This value is achieved by multiplying: 40% * Total- SaleGoal * 80%, where 40% - is a share of funds assigned for Jackpot, TotalSaleGoal – amount of money raised during the Token Sale and 80% - is the  rst part of the Jackpot. The Jackpot will be secured on cold wallets with use of multisignature escrow involving three community stakeholders, while the development team won’t have any access to this money. So when someone lucky wins the Jackpot, it will be transferred manually.2. Second Jackpot. We understand that the probability of winning the Jackpot is 1:49`504`950. But the risk still exists, and we must ensure that we do everything we can to maximize the pro tability of our inves- tors. Therefore, we will have a second Jackpot, the size of 490 BTC, which corresponds to 20% of the funds assigned for the Jackpot. The calculation is as follows: 40% * TotalSaleGoal * 20%. It will also be stored on a cold wallet and use multisignature escrow involving three community stakeholders, but will only be used if the  rst Jackpot is won. Thus, we minimize the risk of losing interest to our lottery if during one of the  rst drawings the Jackpot will be won.3. Transparency. We want to prove to the blockchain community that our game is fair. At this very mo- ment True Flip is not 100% decentralized. Our team knows about this and has a plan on how to make True Flip as much decentralized as virtually possible. Our next goal is to make the lottery independent of any third-party (including the team).4. Development. We plan to develop 3 (three) more lotteries based on smart contracts (more info in 16 paragraph of Whitepaper).5. Marketing and PR. We understand that a project can hardly attract millions of customers without a marketing budget. So selling TFL tokens will assemble a budget for a global marketing campaign.ICO detailsWe have successfully completed the pre-ICO, in which 1`050`000 TFL tokens were sold (5% of the total amount). The raised funds will be used to  nance operations and to increase the jackpot.Expected Token Sale commencement date: June 20th, 2017. Issuance of TFL Tokens: 21`000`000 TFL tokens  © 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 15

 6. Token Sale           Raised funds distribution:We also need to implement a maximum transparency in the system by moving True Flip to a decentralized platform and make it independent from any third parties - this task will also be  nanced from the funds raised during the ICO. Crowdsale campain0.0005 BTC   DevelopmentOperations80%23%20%Marketing BudgetLegal 12%Tocken40%5%   JACKPOT 1000 BTC+   JACKPOT 1JACKPOT 2 20%20% of the Tokens assigned for the development team, remain under escrow and will be released in 3 stages:1. 20% will be available after Token sale;2. 40% will be on hold until reaching the KPI (launch of 3 new lotteries);3. 40% will be on hold for 1 year.At the initial stage Tokens will be distributed between the managing team as a reward for their efforts to bring True Flip platform to existence. In the future these Tokens can be negotiated among other partners interested in development and growth of the project/platform.All unsold tokens will be burned.© 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 17
 6. Token Sale           Escrow of the Token Sale fundsOur escrows are:• Richard Kestelein - CEO (www.cryptoassets.io, Blockchain News, www.the-blockchain.com and www. blockchain-partners.com).• George Basiladze - Founder of Cryptopay, UK bitcoin payment gateway (www.cryptopay.me)• Nikita Parhomenko - Co-Founder and COO of True Flip (www.trueflip.io).Public addresses will be published right after the start of the ICO.The raised funds will be (in a con rmation or two) transferred to a 2/3 multi-signature address, with twoof the keys held by trusted third-party individuals (Escrow). This way the funds are protected in an escrow account that will be released in de ned cases, described below. The raised funds can only be accessed with the consent of at least two of the three signees and when all the conditions are met.• Bitcoin collecting address;• Ethereum collecting address;• Litecoin collecting address.Responsibilities of the crowdfunding escrow are as follows:• Veri cation of the amount and the source of funds not observable on public blockchains through docu- mentation provided by True Flip;• Determining the conditions for a successful or unsuccessful crowdfund in regard to this information; Acting in accordance with this condition to either transfer or refund wallets under partial control of an arbitrator;• Recording the time and the type of arbitrator work hours (via Google doc, viewing and commenting pub- licly).Decidedly not responsible for:• Verifying the functioning of smart contracts or technical infrastructure;• Conforming to or being held liable for the lawful compliance of the investment structure.Liability:• Preserving wallets to the best of the arbitrator’s knowledge and skills (minimum are one set of redun- dant paper wallets and one copy of wallets offline);• In case of negligence to any degree, the maximum liability is the sum of those values and fees that would otherwise be generated, through reimbursement.© 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 18
7. Token investment attractivenessOnce the ICO is completed, the TFL Token will be available for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges. At the moment, we negotiate the details with several exchanges and will announce the results as soon as the agree- ments are reached.TFL Token is the main investment asset of the True Flip platform. It guarantees the Token holders a daily bonus in BTC: 10-15% from each sold ticket will be distributed among all Token holders as dividends:• dividends are accrued daily after each draw;• dividends are paid 4 times a year according to the results of each quarter;• the amount of dividend (within 10-15% of income) is determined by the Token holders voting;• the owners of the Tokens are noti ed in advance of the date of payment;• to receive a dividend, the holders must park their Tokens on the lottery server;• dividends will be calculated only on the parked Tokens in proportion:The scheme of paying dividends and determining the list of persons entitled to receive it is similar to the mechanism used in traditional corporate practice. Therefore, we assume that the dynamics of the TFL quotes will be affected by the calendar features in the same way as traditional stock assets - for example, there will be dividend gap in the shares. From our point of view, this will help to increase the speculative attractiveness of the TFL Token.             Histogram of the TFL Token dividend yield, depending on the market share: 1,1460%1 1, 24 0 % %11,010%0 , 890% %0,670%0,450%0 , 220% %        0,00%0% 0.35% 2.09% 3.82% 5.56% 7.30% 9.04% 10.78% 12.51% 14.25%TFL Token dividend yield, in BTC15.99% © 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0)19MARKETSHARE
7. Token investment attractivenessAccording to the basic forecast, at the initial stage True Flip can seize up to 0.4% of the global online lotteries market (or 0.03% of the world online gambling market), which corresponds to a daily turnover within the sys- tem at 15 BTC. In this case, the annual dividend yield of the TFL token will be approximately at 5.2-7.8% in BTC, depending on the share of the ticket sales revenue assigned for dividend payments.According to the optimistic forecast, at the initial stage True Flip can seize up to 1.1% of the global online lotteries market, which corresponds to a daily turnover within the system at 50 BTC. In this case, the annual dividend yield of the TFL token will be approximately at 17.4-26.1% in BTC, depending on the share of the ticket sales revenue assigned for dividend payments.From our point of view, both calculations are very conservative and do not take into account the growth poten- tial of the whole market in general, and the potential of the True Flip platform for further expansion.Analysis of the sensitivity of True Flip dividends to the average number of tickets sold and the share of income assigned for dividends:Average annual number of tickets sold per day               10,000 30,000 50,000  100,000  200,000 10%   3,5%  10,4%  17,4%   34,8%   69,5%   11% 3,8%11,5%  19,1% 38,2% 76,5% 12%   4,2%  12,5%  20,9%   41,7%   83,4%   13% 4,5%13,6%  22,6% 45,2% 90,4% 14%   4,9%  14,6%  24,3%   48,7%   97,3%   15%  5,2% 15,6%   26,1%  52,1%  104,3%  © 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 20Share of the ticket sales revenue allocated for

 8. Token technical aspects           The True Flip platform implements various feedback types according to the result of an operation performed by the system. No human involvement is required. The purchase of betting tickets is the most frequent oper- ation in the system and any  nancial movement in the platform is executed in Bitcoin regardless of the form of payment initially used. However, you can not confuse the  nancial system with the token implemented on the platform.The token allows its owner to become a partner of the world’s largest blockchain-based lottery.TrueFlip Token (ERC-20 — compatible) TrueFlip Team  1.

Following this standard means that tokens will be easily transferable between users using existing Ethereum wallets as well as allow exchanges smoothly integrate this token into their trading platform.TFL token will be used to distribute rewards from ticket sales among TFL Token holders. In order to stop exchanges from getting TFL holder’s rewards, token functionality is extended.The locking feature: every user with TFL tokens will have an option to lock their tokens for a speci c amount of time. Locked tokens will be the ones participating in rewards payout. But once tokens are locked, it will not be possible to transfer them to other users until the locking period has  nished.© 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 222. Votes
 8. Token technical aspects           Token sale technical aspectsTrueFlip token sale will use Ethereum blockchain. The structure of the sale is presented on the picture. During the crowdsale there will be two ways to buy TFL tokens:  rst one is sending Ether directly to the ICO contract. If people want to invest using other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin or Waves to participate in the crowd- sale, they would need to send their money to the founders in the dashboard, and TrueFlip backend will create a transaction to issue new tokens.After that, in both scenarios, ICO contract will make a ‘contract call’ to the TFL Token Contract to mint new to- kens and allocate them to a public address of an ICO investor. ICO contract is the only entity that will be able to mint tokens. After the end date of the token sale or once all the tokens are sold, TrueFlip founders will issue a transaction that will  nalize the ICO. This will trigger minting the tokens for the team and prevent future tokens from minting on the TFL Token Contract.  ICO Investor    1.Buy Tokens in ETHICO ContractTFL Token Contract During ICO     After ICO  nishes            Rewards payouts10-15% (the exact amount will be decided by voting) of revenue from each ticket sold will be distributed among TFL Token holders based on the number of tokens they hold as outlined in the picture. Only “locked” balances will be participating in reward payouts. As tickets are sold in Bitcoin, conversion to Ether will happen, and bo- nuses will be paid directly to the addresses of Token holders.© 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 232.Buy Tokens in BTC/LTC/Waves  Transfer ETHTransactions to issue tokens TrueFlip founders  TrueFlip multisigMint tokenMint Founders tokenFinalize ICO 
 8. Token technical aspects           Voting with tokensOur team understands that investors of the TrueFlip project receive not only a share in the project, but also all inherent business risks. Therefore, in order to reduce the risks for our investors and for optimal further devel- opment of the TrueFlip project, we have developed a voting system on key issues that will arise as the project develops. Any owner of the TFL Tokens will be able to send their offer to the TrueFlip team using a special form on the website.The basic voting rules with TFL tokens:- voting is considered to be held if there is a quorum;- one TFL token equals to one vote;- only the parked tokens can participate in voting;- only two options will be available for voting: YES or NO;- for each issue on the voting agenda, a time frame for the beginning and the end of the voting period will be provided;- a decision on each item on the voting agenda is made by a simple majority of votes.Voting of the Token owners is considered to be eligible (i.e. has necessary quorum) only if the number of the TFL Tokens that took part in the process is more than 50% of the issued TFL tokens. If there was no quorum, new terms for re-voting on the same issues will be announced. At the same time, on the second vote of the Tokens owners, it will be considered eligible (that is, has the necessary quorum) if the number of the TFL To- kens that took part in the process is more than 30% of the issued TFL tokens. Proposals with text descriptions will be created as separate contracts on Ethereum blockchain. In the dashboard, Token holders will be able to associate their address with their decision on a particular proposal. Once the voting deadline has passed, the contract will calculate the sum of tokens on addresses for decision as well as a number of tokens against this proposal. Once all the votes are considered, the contract will save the results of the voting process, and it will stay forever on the Ethereum blockchain.Lottery transparencyThe lottery happens every day. The winning ticket is picked based on the hash of the  rst block on the bitcoin blockchain after 20:00 UTC. It will not be possible to buy a ticket after 19:30 UTC each day. To verify that there were no ticket purchases after that time all ticket sales will be logged in the Lottery Ethereum contract. Logging every single purchase separately will be quite expensive. Therefore, to save on the transaction costs, TrueFlip backend will calculate the hash of each sold ticket and then compute a root hash in a Merkle tree for all transactions (similar to the way it is done for transactions in bitcoin blocks). This root hash will be pub- lished on the Ethereum blockchain along with other information about the current lottery. Each separate trans- action will still be available through the TrueFlip platform: information about each transaction should have the tx_hash, ticket numbers. After the winning numbers are calculated, TrueFlip backend server will log them to the same contract. Everyone can verify the numbers, as well as all payouts on the Ethereum blockchain and make sure there is no cheating on the platform.© 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 24
 9. Lottery features           Test periodDuring the  rst 3 months after the ICO the jackpot will be limited to 200 BTC in order to test all the algorithms in the system and prevent potential loss of the whole funds due to fraudulent actions. As soon as the platform is audited to be safe, the remainder of the sum will be added.Jackpot: increase and releaseThere are two jackpots in the True Flip lottery. Initially, they are created at the expense of funds raised during the ICO: 40% of the total funds is allocated to the jackpot, 80% of which is assigned to the jackpot No. 1, and the remaining 20% to the jackpot No. 2.Jackpot number 2 is a reserve in case of winning the jackpot number 1. It is not re lled by revenue from the sale of lottery tickets.Jackpot number 1 - the main, it is played daily and is increased by selling lottery tickets.If the jackpot is not raffled in the current draw, then the funds from the current jackpot are going to increase the next. Thus, the Jackpot is growing constantly until the moment when someone wins it.The platform keeps an archive of draws with the whole history and jackpot amounts for each raffle.In case of winning jackpot 1, jackpot number 2 becomes the main one. At the same time, a new reserve jackpot is created. Revenues from the lottery tickets sales are distributed in a ratio of 80:20 to the main and reserve jackpot correspondingly.CalculationThe mathematics of the lottery was developed by Felix Sidokhin.The process of determination of the winning set has 3 stages:• Ticket sale for the current run ends 60 minutes before 8:00 p.m. (UTC);• At 8:00 p.m. (UTC), the  rst hash of transactions accessible for everybody on blockchain.info is taken and this hash cannot be previously predicted;• This hash is incorporated into the algorithm that forms 6 numbers based on the arithmetic action. The source code of the algorithm is open , and anybody can check and repeat calculations.True Flip platform algorithm is clear and very comprehensible, and it is possible to understand how a winning combination is generated following the simple steps below:- Step 1: After the draw closes, the system waits for the next hash in the blockchain - Step 2: Suppose this is the hash received by the system:0000000000000000005867634c363284caf01ce5dd2d6e2a6c2ab26030f33493 © 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 25
 9. Lottery features           - Step 3: This hash is then broken into sequences of 4 (four) characters, starting from the tail, and trans- formed into a number using NHEX base 16:0000 0000 0000 0000 0058 6763 4c36 3284 caf0 1ce5 dd2d 6e2a 6c2a b260 30f3 3493 (3493)16 = (13459)10- Step 4: The found number (13459) is then divided by module of 49 (or 26 in the last iteration) and the re- mainder is taken as one of the balls:13459 mod 49 = 274 * 49 + 33 (hence the  rst ball is 33)- Step 5: The system repeats this iteration 5 times and discards numbers which are already in the set (for the golden ball we simply use mod 26 instead of mod 49)In case of doubts or just out of curiosity, the algorithm can be tested on TrueFlip website athttp://trueflip.io/check-honesty?lang=en.Methods of depositingTrue Flip platform also incorporates multiple payment methods, so every user has a chance to play the game.As True Flip wants to be an international company and its founders realize that not every person has Bitcoins, they decided to add multiple payment processors to the payment method in the hopes to increase the num- ber of people playing. Aside from bitcoin, these payment methods include Ether, Litecoins, Waves and other cryptocurrencies.Since True Flip just entered its beta-testing phase, the number of available currencies is limited. However, TrueFlip’s dedicated development team is working on an in-house exchange to work with a wide range of trad- able cryptocurrencies (altcoins), like Ethereum and Litecoins.Payouts of winningBene ting from the Bitcoin network features, when a ticket wins, the amount is instantly transferred to the users wallets under their accounts. Further, users may:• send Bitcoins to their personal wallets in any other system and convert Bitcoins to any currency of their choosing;• send Bitcoins directly to the exchange services and then convert to any currency;• use True Flip account for any Bitcoin expenses (the address of your True Flip wallet is the sameas in any other system).    © 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0) 26
