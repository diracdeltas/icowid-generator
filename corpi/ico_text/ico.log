Introduction
ACT is a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) addressing social accountability by
aggregating micro payments from citizens to fund grass roots proposals that drive change.

Social Accountability â âthe extent and capability of citizens to hold the state accountable
and make it responsive to their needs.â
It is comprised of two parts:
1.
2.

ACT, where citizens purchase votes, and apply them to proposals; and,
The ACT curation engine (ACE) where ACT Token govern curator rewards.

ACE is the main focus of this technical white paper, because it contains the functionality that
rewards those that hold ACTâs tokens, which are called ACT and ACTION.

Background
The original ACT Concept Note should be consulted for a more in-depth analysis about the
ACT impact model, its main social principles, as well as the theory of change that underpins
it.

How does ACT work?
To use ACT, citizens first download the mobile App to their mobile device, which initially
invites them to choose cause types they wish to address through social accountability
interventions, and then purchase votes which are used to support proposals. The pooled
funds raised through vote purchases are used to fund successful proposals. Browsers such as
Toshi or Status could also be used with an ACT bot.
The vision for ACT is that vote holders â citizens all over the world â receive push notifications
via the ACT mobile App alerting them about important proposals, and allowing them to vote
âyesâ, ânoâ, or âabstainâ. Their actions drive change because if a quorum is reached a smart
contract is triggered and the proposal is funded instantly.
At this point, some readers might surmise; âIs this crowd funding?â But, please maintain an
open mind in order to capture the new innovation that ACT aims to be.
By way of illustration, mobile phone users with âtop-upâ or âpay as you goâ accounts do not
top-up each time that they wish to send an SMS. Rather, they keep their accounts topped up
so that they can send an SMS or respond to an SMS from a friend when they need to. So it is
with ACT â people will keep their votes topped up so that they can react to proposals
continuously.

ACT is designed to become the de facto global platform that drives social accountability
through funding proposals. As such, citizens would use it in a way that is consistent with this
purpose â they should desire to maintain a balance of votes relating to the areas that they
care about so that they can respond to proposals in real time.
This is not to say that ACTâs community might not grow when, as a direct result of any given
cause receiving significant media coverage, citizens set up accounts in response, but ACT is
different than crowdfunding, fundamentally.

ACTâs design

Two central goals with this DAO design were:
1. Vote price accessibility - to maintain a price for âvotesâ that is accessible for everyone
in the world regardless of their personal economic context; and,
2. Proposal quality and validity - to ensure that DOACT voters only receive proposals
through the App that are high potential, valid, non-spam, legal and legitimate.

Vote price accessibility
The challenge of vote price is resolved relatively easily by denominating the cost of one vote
in dollars rather than ETH. The initial nominal cost will be 10 centsâ  (USD) with a limit of
number of votes that an ACT user can apply to any given proposal of 100 dollarsâ worthâ  (1000
votes).
However, where millions of voters might be amongst the poorest people in the world (living
on less than $1 per day) this is not enough because there is a risk that wealthier groups could
capitalise on votes. A mechanism will therefore be designed to mitigate this risk, such as
further limits on the number of votes that a user can apply to a given proposal.

Proposal quality and validity

The second challenge is the main topic of this âtechnical white paper.â
The ACT curation engine (ACE) is a decentralised platform for vetting proposals. It rewards its
curators through an algorithm derived to score individual contributions that most community
members will consider to be a fair assessment of the subjective value of each contribution.
15%â  of all ETH received from ACT users who purchase votes is allocated to reward curators.
ACT is hard wired to distributed this to the curation community in accordance with rewards
evaluated by algorithmâ .

Security
ACTâs ETH pools are stored in the ethereum blockchain, not a new blockchain built and
maintained by its development team. In this way, the potentially millions of dollars donated
by users globally to obtain votes will be stored with proven and tested security.

Smart contracts will trigger payments to curators and proposal makers in line with the ACT
code, immutably.
In order to reduce the risk of funds flowing to fraudulent proposals, âFirst timerâ proposal
amounts could be cappedâ  but, in any event, the average âticket sizeâ of typical proposals
will be hundreds or thousands of dollars rather than millions, so the risks are not unwieldy.

ICO Design
ACT is the token that is the unit of account in the ACE. 10 billionâ  ACT will be issued during
the âICOâ, and allocated by the smart contract as follows:
â˘
â˘
â˘
â˘
â˘

ACT Donation Campaigns - 82.5% (including pre-ICO)
ACT Contributors - 8.0%
ACT Team - 5.0% (paid as ACTION vesting tokens)
Daoact Ltd - 3.0%
ACT Bounties - 1.5%

The ACT Curation Engine (ACE) process
The basic ACE process follows this path:

(1) Proposal submission > (2) Curation > (3) ACTIVATION > (4) Voting
1. Proposal submission
Proposal submission requires a small paymentâ  of ETH, and proposal value could be
constrained depending on the platformâs capitalisation. The proposal is just as public as any
post on Steemit or Medium, or campaign on Kickstarter or GoFundMe. Proposals may also be
shelved if they receive a high volume of downticksâ  early in the curation period.

2. Curation
Many institutions responsible for allocating public money are obliged to operate in a
transparent way. The dialogue can, in fact, be conducted in the public domain, or,
alternatively, the information can be obtained by any citizen through freedom of information
regulation. Similarly, in the ACT model transparency is fundamental, and we do not see why
any discussions relating to the validity of a proposal should not be completely open.
Letâs consider some examples.
Example 1: The rights of Maria Dzubaâs disabled daughter
The ACT white paper, website and explainer video all use the hypothetical example of
Maria Dzuba from Minsk, Belarus to help explain the what and why of ACT.
In summary, Mariaâs 8 year old daughter Lera is disabled and local government
refused to repair the elevator in her building for budget reasons. Belarusian law allows

â  Tunable value

contact@daoact.org

for a petition to be raised to create a âpublic letterâ which can be considered. Maria
asks the ACT community for $200 to fund her campaign.
The question we are asking here is; âHow can curators ensure that Maria is a
legitimate cause and an honest proposalâ? Curators could publicly ask Maria in the
actual thread of the proposal (like a post to Steemit) to post a picture or video of her
and Lera within the thread and holding a page stating âHello ACT.â For a consideration
of $200 this might be deemed enough for some curators to âsign offâ on the proposal.
Others might ask for correspondence with the local government to be posted, and
others could translate this from Russian into English. Similar to Steemit, each action in
itself can be upâd by the community to signal its value, which the ACT algorithm will
use to assign reward.
Example 2: A journalist detained and in need of legal support
Sometimes when civic mobilization occurs within a hostile political system, the
independent media that seeks to cover the story can get into hot water. For example,
a cameraman could have his/her equipment confiscated and he/she could be
detained by the police. In this instance, the person urgently needs the best legal
support. ACT could support such an intervention, and even fund replacement
equipment!
The parent media organisation could post the proposal and seek support, but curators
might interpret this as exposing the ACT community to directly funding some
organisation or individual that a sovereign state has an issue with. Alternatively, a legal
firm retained by the media organisation could demonstrate that it will receive the
funds directly and for the express purpose of representing the detained journalist. In
this way, ACT funds remain more non-partisan and independent which the community
might prefer. The curators might invite the proposed legal representatives to post a
link on their corporate website as proof that the request originates from them, as well
as other assurances that the funding will go directly to the law firm.
Example 3: Communities fighting coal mining expansion in the United Kingdom
Reclaim the Power is a growing network in the UK that supports local communities
fighting open cast coal mining that is harmful to their health and the wellbeing of their
children. The expansion plans also threaten to drive other existing and new employers
from the area who do not want to be located where scientists confirm that they will
suffer dire health consequences as a result of these egregious activities.
In one action during 2016 the operations of a major coal mine in Wales were halted
by public protestors. Some groups protested peacefully at the gates of the coal plant,
while others entered the property and chained themselves to the mining machinery.
This was part of a global movement that included actions from Australia to Indonesia
to Germany seeking to stem the tide of destructive fossil fuel use globally.

In Wales, the police eventually told the community leaders that in order to avoid being
arrested the Reclaim the Power supporters would have to remove themselves from
the machinery without further persuasion. The community decided that it wanted the
protests (which were successful) to end without arrest and that is what happened.
Such movements inevitably end up weighing heavily financially on communities that
initiate them. Consequently, they can ill afford to maintain them let alone expand
them in line with the potential for real impact and change. Put simply, as the
movement grows so do its costs. Within a traditional approach, a non-profit
organisation could be established with seven or more high-profile and reputable
directors. It would then recruit staff and solicit people and grant makers for donations.
But this too costs money (such as for the assistance of professional service providers
like lawyers and accountants), and takes a great deal of time. Ultimately, what
emerges is a legal entity with significant overheads, and which, in fact, can be halted
through court injunction, and whose staff and directors are influenced by reputational
risk, internal politics, and certain other types of liability.
In order to succeed on the ACT platform, the Welsh community group (or an
organisation like Reclaim the Power) could propose that ACT finances very specific
costs relating to growing their campaign. These could include, for example, the cost
of marquees to host the members of the public who turn out in support, or a PR firm
to help maximise media exposure.
Such a proposal could easily satisfy the need for curators to push only safe and vetted
proposals to ACT by publishing the actual written quotation for marquees or PR from
their respective suppliers, and even go as far as offer wallet details controlled by a
third party that agrees (again publicly) to use the proceeds for these purposes alone.
This also helps to allay fears that the ACT community could have about the legality of
what is being funded (also a requirement that curators must consider). Case in point,
funding locks and chains that are to be used to disable privately owned equipment
will not pass the curatorâs rigour, but there is nothing illegal about using the funds to
rent a marque that will be erected on permissioned land, nor a PR firm to conduct
promotion.
Additionally, if the action is a great success and real momentum is gained and traction
achieved in the media, the community might want to act again quickly, and instead of
a lengthy process of raising more funds in the traditional way, it could submit a new
proposal leveraging its now established reputation on ACT, and raising more funds in
a matter of days to fuel more civil mobilization and citizen action.
Actually, ACT could potentially fund civic movements at any rate at which they grow, even
exponentially.

3. ACTIVATION
The ACTIVATION algorithmâ  will push proposals to ACT users locally and globally (whose
profile settings selected the theme and geography of the proposal) once the underlying
conditions and criteria are satisfied.

4. Votes
Once ACTIVATION occurs, ACT users are notified by the App on their mobile device. They can
open the proposal read it together with the entire dialogue with curators and decide to vote
yes, no or abstain. If a quorum of 60%â  is reached then the proposal is funded.
ACT users could also have an option to âassignâ their votes to another member who exhibits
recognised expertise in the topic under proposal, or whose reputation otherwise encourages
the user to assign his or her vote to this person. Reputation could be evaluated by success
rateâ  of proposal voted for, or success rate as a curator (presumably many curators will also
be active participants on ACT). This feature would also ensure that voting power is limited so
as to prevent capture by any particular interest group.

ACT Curator Rewards
As described above, the ACEâs design empowers the curation community to unambiguously
act as guardian of proposal quality on behalf of the global ACT community. The curatorsâ role
is fundamental to the success of the platform and the mission of ACT, and, as such, deserves
significant reward.
Anyone can access the curation engine by creating an account, but unless the user owns ACT
tokens he/she will not earn rewards. However, their wallet will display virtual rewards i.e.
those that they would have earned if they indeed owned ACT tokens. This will support
liquidity by encouraging these curators to buy ACT tokens and participate in the community
rewards programme.
How will the rewards be allocated?
An initial algorithm is proposed as follows:
ActionPct = The percentage of tokens held by a curator from the total amount of ACTION
tokens held by all curators who took part in the curation of this specific proposal.
CurationPct = The percentage of curation work that has been done by a curator from the total
curation work done for this specific proposal.
InterimReward = = CurationPct / 10 * (-0,0005 * ( ActionPct - 100)^2 + 10)
Reward = đźđđĄđđđđđđđ¤đđđ â

Other factors such as timeliness of curation effort, and curator reputation could also factor.

ACT and ACTION Token
The cryptocurrency arena is characterised by speculators switching from one cryptocurrency
to another depending mainly on which one they expect to have short-term growth. This
behaviour risks undermining smooth growth and development of a new global initiative such
as ACT. Steemit addressed this problem by having a distinct âinfluence tokenâ called Steem
Power the value of which is derived from the platformâs unit of account (Steem tokens).
Holders of Steem Power are rewarded with the lion share of newly issued steem but can only
âvestâ their position over a two-year period.
In theory, long term commitment of stakeholders causes them to vote for long-term growth
rather than short-term pumps. We want a curation engine that rewards those with a longterm perspective and interest in the platform. It must be imperative to only ACTIVATE the
best quality proposals, which are safe and appropriate recipients for ACT users donated funds.
In the case of ACT, this commitment is encouraged because when proposals are not successful
after being ACTIVATED and sent to the ACT voting community, then only those curators who
flagged or downticked (proposals can be marked â+â or â-â by curators) a proposal are
rewarded, but the problem of altcoin volatility due to speculation remains at odds with the
long-term health of ACT and ACT tokens.
The solution is a second token, called ACTION which is not an influence token as in the case
of Steemit (we do not want those with buying power to exert more influence) but it does
weight the rewards via an algorithmâ  depending on how much ACTION the account has, and
how much the account contributed to successful curation outcomes. Like Steem Power,
ACTION can only be converted back (vesting) to ACT over time. In the case of ACTION a 1â 
year period via 12â  equal monthly payments.
ACTION is therefore a ârewards tokenâ for both long termism and curation effort. It is nontransferrable and can be acquired on the platform with ACT, which means that it cannot be
easily traded on cryptocurrency exchanges.
Unapologetically, the ACT model cherry picks some of the best innovations pioneered by
Steemit, WINGS and other first movers. This approach is both efficient and prudent. For
instance, as Steemit succeeds globally (perhaps becoming a ubiquitous global social network)
people will become familiar with an interface and token exchange set up that is very similar
to ACT.
It is hoped that ACT will become a ubiquitous platform for social accountability!
In the future, as those in the crypto space know, people in the mainstream will seamlessly
exchange cryptocurrencies as easily as they send SMS messages today. Their self-sovereign,
blockchain secured identities will empower every aspect of daily life, from banking, to social
media, to energy, to, we hope, improved social accountability.

Making changes to the smart contract and tunable values
There are a number of established models for changing a DAOâs mechanics. WINGS suggest a
liquid governance approach to accepting DAO modification or upgrade suggestions for smart
contracts. Steemit has repeatedly forked its platform to implement structural changes which
derive from community sentiment and the actions and opinions of its 19 independently
chosen witnesses.
In common with these innovative platforms, ACT will also benefit from a well-funded core
team of developers, marketing specialists, UX developers and strategic advisors that will
absorb community sentiment, and interpret trends and behaviours (both good and bad) that
require responses in ACT in order to improve its chances of achieving what it sets out to do.
To support platform sustainability, ACTâs smart contract will pay 1-2.5% of revenues to Daoact
Ltd, and 1-2.5% of revenues to the Daoact Foundation, depending on the amount of funds
raised during donation campaigns.

Concluding remarks
This white paper deliberately highlights each of the tunable values that dictate how the
curation engine will operate in the hope that the focus of discussion around this white paper
will be on how to make ACT Beta as fit for purpose as possible.
The crypto community â those that will make up the bulk of supporters during ICO â comprise
specialists from diverse fields including behavioural economics, advanced mathematics, game
theory, coding languages, and complex algorithms. The ethos of this community is one of
collaboration and participation. The donation campaigns are an opportunity to debate and
contribute to the design of the DAO and its constituent parts. Such ideas are foreign in the
world of traditional centralised corporation and venture capital but we believe that an ICO is
as much about design as it is funding activities that will make the decentralised vision of the
project reality.
Thank you, and welcome to ACT.

Abstract
In this white paper, we discuss the phased rollout of Adel's ecosystem.
The first phase includes the launch of Adel through an initial coin offering
(ICO). Phases two and three will focus on building and managing the
community.

Creating the Foundation
Adel is a new cryptocurrency system and global community that is selfsustaining and operates within its own macroeconomic ecosystem. This
ecosystem will maintain its fiat independence through the use of
Adelphoi1. It will also have the ability to trade with other economies.

The Adel ecosystem will consist of three phases. Phase one will build the
community portion of the ecosystem by creating the Account Module of
the community portal and includes the first initial coin offering (ICO)
round. Phase two will begin after the first ICO round and will focus on
developing the community portal: Forum, Voting, Project Dashboard, and
Trading Modules. Phase three will focus on operating and managing the
projects and converting them into successful solutions that will benefit
the entire community.

ICO Process
Adel will have three rounds of ICOs to ensure a controlled deployment of
funds as various projects are introduced to the community. This ensures a
focus on planning rather than pure capital collection. Adel also wants to
further ensure that no single person or small group will be able to
dominate the community. A diverse set of stakeholders will guarantee a
more democratic outcome as voting will be distributed amongst a greater
number of stakeholders. Moreover, this will create confidence in early ICO
participants who will be supportive of the values established by Adel.
There will be a total of 100 million non-mineable Adelphoi (ADL) coins
available in the Adel ecosystem:
▲ 85 million ADL will be distributed through 3 rounds of an Initial Coin
Offering (ICO).
▲ 15 million ADL will be distributed amongst Adel Ecosystem Ltd.
From this amount, 5 million Adelphoi will be released at each round
of the ICO. This will ensure transparency and long-term
commitment from Adel Ecosystem Ltd.
During the first ICO round, funds in BTC will be immediately placed into
Adel’s escrow storage – an offline repository residing in a BitGo2 account.
ShapeShift and Changelly will be actively supported for ICO collection as
they are the market leaders in instant digital currency conversion. Both
ShapeShift and Changelly are used to easily convert cryptocurrencies
from one to another. Any participant of the ICO will have to identify
themselves to meet minimum Anti-Money Laundering (AML), CounterTerrorism Financing (CTF) and Know your Customer (KYC) requirements.

Phase 1 ▲ Community
Initial Coin Offering ▲ 1st Round ▲ 33,333,333 ADL
Adel will build the foundation of the community during this phase. This
phase includes activities up to, and including, the first ICO round. This
includes the website, key marketing materials, white papers, corporate
branding guidelines, and a showcase of the unique features of the Adel
ecosystem. Phase one establishes the structure of the Adel Board, as well
as the senior management team and staff members who will be

instrumental in building Adel’s foundation. This consists of marketing
specialists, blockchain developers, and cryptocurrency experts.
The first ICO round will be open for one month. A minimum contribution
is required to become an stakeholder in this round (refer to the Adel ICO
Round 1 announcement for this minimum). The ICO will be open to most
of the available cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrencies collected will be
automatically exchanged for Bitcoin via ShapeShift or Changelly. Tokens
not accepted by these exchanges will not be accepted in the ICO. After
the first ICO round, the total amount will be proportionally calculated and
exchanged for 28,333,333 units of Adelphoi and distributed to each Adel
stakeholder. An additional five million Adelphoi will then be allocated to
Adel Ecosystem Ltd.
There will be five stages for stakeholders to earn different bonus
percentages for their BTC and tokens converted by ShapeShift or
Changelly. This bonus refers to the amount of Adelphoi the stakeholder
will receive, and will be directly proportional to their voting power in the
community:
▲ 20% bonus in ADL ▲First 3 days ▲12:00 noon UTC on May 1st till
23:59 UTC on May 3rd
▲ 15% bonus in ADL ▲ Next seven days ▲ 00:00 UTC on May 4th
till 23:59 UTC on May 10th)
▲ 10% bonus in ADL ▲ Next seven days ▲ 00:00 UTC on May 11th
till 23:59 UTC on May 17th)
▲ 5% bonus in ADL ▲ Next seven days ▲ 00:00 UTC on May 18th
till 23:59 UTC on May 24th)
▲ 0% bonus ▲ Last seven days ▲ 00:00 UTC on May 25th till 23:59
UTC on May 31st)
▲ 15% bonus in ADL ▲ Special bonus for contributions of over 20
BTC ▲ Stakeholders who exceed this minimum will receive an
automatic bonus of 15% no matter when they submitted their first
contribution.
Stakeholders will be able to keep their bonus should they decide to
increase their contribution within the following weeks of the ICO. For
example, in the following infographic, if a stakeholder contributes during
the second stage, then they will continue to receive a 15% bonus even if
they increased their contribution during the fourth stage of the ICO.

Prior to the ICO Adel will establish a total minimum amount of funds
received by contributors of the ICO (refer to Adel’s FAQ at
www.adelphoi.io). In the event that this minimum contribution is not
reached, there will be a vote conducted amongst the community
members as to whether Adel will continue.
The following materials and applications will be released during this
phase:
▲ The homepage, which will introduce Adel to the cryptocurrency
community and the world at large. It will also outline Adel's core
values. Our home page will showcase the initial round of green-lit
projects, showing a top-level overview, along with their unique
technical and business solutions. A series of white papers, including
this one, will describe our unique approach to community-based
projects. Other white papers will describe our policies, procedures,
and underlying technologies and philosophies that fuel our
ecosystem.
▲ The Adel Community Portal will be an extranet portal used to view
all of the community's confidential activities. It will include detailed
guidelines for project submissions, as well as a landing page.
▲ The status of each community member’s contributions will be
displayed in real time in the Account Module. Each community
member will be able to see the status of any payments they receive
in this module.

Phase 2 ▲ Projects
Initial Coin Offering ▲ 2nd Round ▲ 33,333,333 ADL
Adel’s second phase will begin as soon as the first ICO window has
closed and will run until the 2nd ICO.
The following materials and applications will be released shortly after the
first ICO:
▲ The Collaboration Module will be the social media platform using
third-party services where community members can discuss
projects and direct their questions to the project managers and the
Project Review Committee.
▲ The Voting Module will be created for community members to vote
on projects and other key decisions.
▲ Adel will nominate the members of the Project Review Committee
who will evaluate ideas, and develop business plans, before they
are submitted to the community vote, as well as participate on
forums to discuss ongoing projects with the community.
▲ The Transaction Module will only be available to Adel Board
members. This module will be used to pay project capital costs and
other required expenses. It will also have dashboard visibility and
oversight of all payments executed (pending approval), as well as
all associated management summaries necessary to effectively
manage the community and its projects.
▲ The initial deployment of the Trading Module will allow community
members to easily trade their Adelphoi with other community
members. Future versions of the Trading Module will connect to
available external payment gateways, fiat monetary platforms, and
other cryptocurrency exchanges for community members. This will
further ensure that each community member has sufficient freedom
which will be represented by the liquidity of their resources.
▲ The Project Module will also be released during this phase and will
contain detailed information on the operations of each project.
Postings and overall content will be owned by the project
managers. Adel will redistribute success back to community
members.
▲ A Market Module will be used to post job descriptions, and for
members to submit their resume to any available position. This
module will also list products and services that are available from
any project, with favorable conditions for community members.

This phase will further establish the foundation for Adel project
submission, approval, marketing, and ongoing operations. Projects
involving technological innovation can have either a global or regional
reach. They may participate in, but would not be limited to, Business to
Business (B2B), Business to Consumer (B2C), or even Business to
Government (B2G) environments. Projects will be funded with the funds
raised through three rounds of ICO, as well as from future project profits
or exits.
A new licensed legal entity called Adel Ltd. plans to be established as the
vehicle for pooled community investments into community-owned
projects. This entity will issue equity shares called Adelshares (ADS).
These will be tokenized on the blockchain as the Adelshare (ADS).
Adelshares will be purchased only with the Adelphoi coin. When Adel Ltd.
is registered, participants will be offered the opportunity to purchase ADS
with their ADL, to establish equity ownership in Adel Ltd. and its portfolio
of community-approved projects. Ownership of ADS allows its holder a
respective share of dividends on the basis of one unit per ADS. Any
dividend payment will be paid out to shareholders in ADL.3
First round ICO participants will be offered preferred conditions when
purchasing Adelphoi in subsequent rounds. Each ICO round will be
associated with innovative projects that will be funded by capital raised
by their respective ICO.

Phase 3 ▲ Execution
Initial Coin Offering ▲ 3rd Round ▲ 33,333,333 ADL
Adel will focus on expansion and other improvements that are in line with
Adel’s core values during this phase. Thus, Adel will evaluate the opening
of offices in new regions around the globe with due diligence and a
justified business case. Adel will select the most qualified representatives
and management from its community members for regional offices and
projects in those regions.

Bitcoin Repository
Adel will utilize a BitGo account to collect funds for Adel Ecosystem Ltd.
ICO funds will be collected in escrow and will require five out of six
signatories to approve the release of funds. These signatories comprise of
three Adel Board members and three external and independent parties,
well-known in the crypto community. The funds will be released in a
phased manner as follows:
▲ 30% of the BTC escrow funds will be released shortly after the ICO
(1st of June 2017) to continue paying developers, legal services,
support costs. These funds will be used for building the community
portal and its modules, and launching the second phase of Adel
Accelerator Ltd, and its Adelshare (ADS) token.
▲ Once the ICO is closed, then ADL coins will be distributed to ICO
participants, and their balance will be visible in the community’s
account module. Participants contributing over 1 BTC during the
ICO will be invited to become a community member, and depending
on their ADL balance additional identification details will be
collected in order to meet Anti-Money Laundering (AML), CounterTerrorism Financing (CTF) and Know your Customer (KYC)
requirements.
▲ Selected external exchanges will be contacted prior to the end of
the ICO for members to trade their ADL afterwards.
▲ 70% of the BTC escrow funds will be released to Adel Ecosystem
Ltd. after the fund license is granted, and Adel Ltd. is established
as a legal entity.
Bitcoin used for funding projects will be held in two repositories:
▲ Cold storage ▲ This is an offline repository where the bulk of the
funds will reside. Funds from the cold storage will be transferred to
the hot wallet following the approval of three Adel Signatories. The
cold storage will reside in a BitGo account.
▲ Hot wallet ▲ This will be the account where bitcoins will be used
for funding the initial launch of projects (e.g. capital and initial
operating costs). The hot wallet will be also the active account
where salaries, expenses and operating costs of Adel will be paid.
This repository will consist of a designated maximum transaction
amount of BTC for security reasons, dependent on the operational
activities of Adel projects and how they weigh against security
risks.

ICO Example

Legend
▲ ADL = Adelphoi
▲ BTC = Bitcoins
▲ Stkhldr = Stakeholder = any participant holding any amount of

Interpretation
▲ In this example, 33,333,333 ADL coins will trade based on a
starting value of 0.890 US$ per Adelphoi (ADL).
▲ Stakeholder A.2 (in the example above) with 40 bitcoins
contributed receives a 15% voting influence bonus, equal to an
“effective” bonus of 6 BTC which translates to 15% increase in
ADL.
▲ At the end of the 1st ICO, A.2 participant (in the example above)
stakeholder’s voting influence is calculated at 0.149%
▲ Stakeholder A.2's ICO round one amount of ADL in their account
will be 42,279.116 ADL.

Notes
▲ The Adelphoi value will be established at the end of the first ICO
round.
▲ 28,333,333 tokens will be issued to stakeholders. 5,000,000 will be
reserved for Adel Ecosystem Ltd.
▲ Those who have contributed a minimum of 1 BTC equivalent in
Adelphoi will be invited to the community. After the ICO this
minimum will be increased to 2 BTC (equivalent in ADL). This is to
mitigate the creation of multiple accounts, as well as to provide a
clearer voice for those who have a significant stake in the
ecosystem.

Abstract. This whitepaper addresses existing problems with conventional non-machine readable contracts. Such conventional contracts (CC)
are complicated to set up, disconnected from ICT-systems and when conflicts occur, tracking their execution is restrictively slow and in addition,
CCs are challenging to enforce. On the other hand, so called self-aware
contracts (SAC) that are similar to CCs with respect to legal enforceability, are machine readable and supportable by blockchain-technology.
SACs do not require qualitative trust between contracting parties because blockchains establish instead a quantitative notion of trust as
SAC-related events are immutably stored. However, currently existing
machine-readable contract solutions, i.e., smart contracts, lack suitable
obligation constructs for execution and enforcement. Additionally, current systems do not comprehend the dynamics of legal relationships. It
is important to mask legal obligations with daily human conduct. This
whitepaper address the gap by specifying a so-called Agrello-framework
that enables blockchain-driven self-aware agents-assisted contracts for a
decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) economy.
Key words: self aware, multi agent, blockchain, smart contract, decentralized, per-to-peer, e-governance, human readable

1 Introduction
The traditional understanding of a conventional contract (CC) is an exchange
of commitments by identified parties that are enforceable by law. An important
prerequisite for a contract that most commonly exists as a written document as
evidence, is that the parties involved voluntarily engage to establish a consensus
[19]. In most business cases, CCs are documents [44] that identify the contracting
parties uniquely and state explicitly the commitments of the latter. When those
commitments are performed, their status changes over time. Another problem

2

Alex Norta

with the traditional form of setting up and managing CCs is that they are
often underspecified and the ability to manually track their status is restricted.
As there is no concrete overview of the CC-status, the contractual relationship
between parties is prone to conflict. The resulting costly conflict resolutions may
even collapse an entire contractual relationship. Also the enforcement of CCs [29]
proves to be either too complicated, time consuming, or impossible, certainly in
international circumstances.
The authors in [20] recognize that shared blockchain technology enables business collaborations that require high-reliability and shared, trusted, privacypreserving, immutable data repositories for smart contracts. So-called business
artifacts for adopting data-aware processes provide a basis on shared blockchains
that enable business-collaboration languages such a Solidity [25] of Ethereum.
In [52], the authors map a running case of a collaborative process onto a smartcontract scripting language. That approach addresses the trust-issue in collaborative processes in that no single third-party entity must monitor events. Instead,
the blockchain enables trustless process collaboration because of no single entity
being in control. The mapping from collaborative processes to blockchains enables the monitoring of process enactment and an auditing of related events. In
[21], different smart-contract language choices are compared. While procedural
languages are currently the norm[25], also logic-based languages are alternatives.
The state of the art above shows that partial smart-contract approaches exist
for blockchain technology. However, there is a lack of a framework moving smarttowards self-aware contracts (SAC) where the latter have the ability to gather
information about their internal and external-contextual state and progress to
reason about their behavior while being an artifact of law. Furthermore, the
state of the art above also does not recognize that such SACs must cater for
having humans in the contract loop. This paper fills the gap by posing the
question how to make self-aware human-readable contracts legally viable? To
reduce complexity and establish a separation of concerns, we deduce three further
sub-questions as follows. What enables contracts to be self aware? What enables
SACs to be human manageable? What ensures contract immutability for legal
viability?
The remainder of this whitepaper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents
a running case for SAC management along with related literature that prepares for subsequent sections. Section 3 focuses on the important relationship
in SACs between essential content and the mapping to business processes that
require monitoring. Section 4 discusses the meaningful integration of humans in
the SAC lifecycle. Section 5 explores which pre-existing blockchain-technology
solutions can be combined in a suitable way for achieving a trustable management of contract elements. Section 6 evaluates the results against the running
case, employing a proof-of-concept prototype. Finally, Section 7 concludes the
whitepaper and also comprises plans for future work.

2 Background Literature and Running Case
In section 2.1 we present related literature that prepares the reader for subsequent sections. Section 2.2 contains a running contract case that stems from
real-life apartment-renting contracts. Note that we use the terms beneficiary for
creditor and obligor for debtor.
2.1 Related Work
Scholarly literature about SACs exists. In [2], the core elements of legislation are
addressed, including duties and obligations that share intersecting properties.
The characteristic of a duty is the absence of a benefiting party (beneficiary),
while the performance of an obligation serves a beneficial result for a determined
beneficiary. The focus of the whitepaper is on obligations the properties of which
Figure 1 informally depicts.

Fig. 1. Informal properties of an obligation.

The properties in Figure 1 show a micro-process for obligations development
using the business-process modeling notation BPMN [28]. The small green-lined
circle denotes the start of the process and the red-lined circle the end. Rectangles
in Figure 1 are tasks and x-labeled diamonds denote an exclusive-choice split
and -join respectively. Directed arcs connect the nodes along a control flow from
start to end. Figure 1 shows that obligations exist to either do something or to
refrain from something. Further details about these so-called smart obligations
are presented in Section 3.

In contract law, rights and obligations are related so that if one party to
the contract decides to use his right, there is a corresponding obligation on the
other party. Rights that stem from the contract are reflected in obligations of
the other party. Figure 2 depicts a micro-lifecycle of rights specifications. After
determining the beneficiary of a right, there can either be a right to claim, or a
right to do something that pertains to an action type and object. Finally, the
obligors must be determined who enable a right. For example, the lessee has a
payment obligation in a rental contract. In case of a late payment, the lessor has
the right to claim late-payment charges. After invoking that right, the lessee has
an obligation to pay.
Orchestration and choreography protocols that facilitate, verify and enact
agreements between consenting parties are termed smart contracts [23, 40, 45].
The latter initially find application in diverse domains such as financial technology [10], Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications [42] and digital-signing solutions [14]. An essential aspect of smart contracts is a decentralized validation of
transactions, initially by means of so-called proof-of-work (PoW) [51]. The core
technology that enables smart contracts is a public distributed ledger termed
the blockchain that records transaction events without requiring a trusted central authority. Blockchain technology spreads in popularity with the inception
of Bitcoin [31], a peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency and payment system that
comprises a limited set of operations on the protocol layer. Bitcoins use PoW
for transaction validation that is computationally expensive and electricity intensive.
Most proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains can source their heritage back to PeerCoin1 that is based on an earlier version of Bitcoin Core. There are different PoW
algorithms such as Scrypt2 , X113 , Groestl4 , Equihash [6], etc. The purpose of
launching a new algorithm is to prevent the accumulation of computing power
by one entity and ensure that Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC)
can not be introduced into the economy.
There are ongoing discussions about consensus and which platform meets
the needs of respective project requirements. The consensus topics most widely
discussed are: PoW [50], PoS [5], Dynamic PoS5 , and Byzantine Fault Tolerance
[12] as discussed by HyperLedger. The nature of consensus is about achieving
data consistency with distributed algorithms. Available options are, e.g., the
Fischer Lynch and Paterson theorem [7] that states consensus cannot be reached
without 100% agreement amongst nodes.
In the UTXO model, transactions use as input unspent Bitcoins that are
destroyed and as transaction outputs, new UTXOs are created. Unspent transaction outputs are created as change and returned to the spender [1]. In this way,
a certain volume of Bitcoins is transferred among different private key owners

and new UTXOs are spent and created in the transaction chain. The UTXO of a
Bitcoin transaction is unlocked by the private key that is used to sign a modified
version of a transaction. In the Bitcoin network, miners generate Bitcoins with a
process called a coinbase transaction, which does not contain any inputs. Bitcoin
uses a scripting language for transactions with a limited set of operations6 . In
the Bitcoin network, the scripting system processes data by stacks (Main Stack
and Alt Stack), which is an abstract data type following the LIFO principle of
Last-In, First-Out.
In [39], the authors define an ontology that allows for a rapid validation of
the concepts and properties existing contracting languages comprise7 . A stateof-the-art formalization means of ontologies is to use the web ontology language
OWL [27]. The latter organizes class hierarchies and allows practitioners to find
a common semantical understanding about a problem domain. Note that ontologies represent constantly evolving information on the Internet originating from
heterogeneous data sources.
The obligation ontology for this paper we design with the Protégé tool [30]
that is a free, open source ontology editor for systematic knowledge acquisition.
Protégé comprises a graphic user interface with plugins for varying ontology visualizations and correctness checks. We employ the HermiT reasoner [18] to check
the ontology consistency, identify subsumption relationships between classes, and
so on.
Since the obligation ontology is static, we employ Coloured Petri Nets (CPN)
[22] as a graphical oriented language for covering the dynamic aspects of obligation processing using CPNTools8 . Informally, the CPN-notation comprises
states, denoted as circles, transitions, denoted as rectangles, arcs that connect
states and transitions but never states with other states or transitions with other
transitions, and tokens with color, i.e., attributes with values. Arcs carry inscriptions in CPN-ML expressions that evaluate to a multiset or a single element.
Modules in CPN are non-atomic place-holder nodes for hierarchic refinements
that correspond to respective services in a system-implementation.
The holistic lifecycle management of SACs is relevant and has been ignored
so far by industry practitioners. Consequently, in [34], the startup phase commences with choosing from a library a contract template where the latter is
configured with service types and roles. Concrete service offers from tentative
eCommunity partners populate the service offers and roles before a negotiation
phase either results in a terminating dissent of only one party, or a counteroffer
that requires a restart of the negotiation, or a consent that establishes a contract. The next phase of the lifecycle [35] involves creating local contract copies
for each eCommunity partner. The local contract copies are the means for deducing respective sets of business policies, network monitors, monitoring agents
and communication endpoints of concrete technical services for the enactment
phase. The latter [41] is carried out in a distributed way and when a violation

of a business policy occurs, the non-violating eCommunity parties must vote on
the perceived severity. The outcome options are either calming for the ongoing contract enactment, or disruptive. The former maintain the enactment and
comprises voting outcomes, such as ignoring a violation, or replacements of a
business rules, service offers, an eCommunity party with a new one, and so on.
Calming reactions require to varying degrees a destruction of flowing business
semantics for rolling back the remaining subset to earlier contract-lifecycle stages
in a targeted way. A disruptive voting outcome leads to a sudden termination of
an ongoing enactment as the business-rule violation is perceived as too severe.
The rollback results in a new negotiation for starting another contract, unless
the business case seizes to exist.
The potential conflicts that occur between decentralized autonomous agents
(DAO), require specific modeling, management and resolution [32]. The management works as such that first, a conflict is detected by analyzing the exceptions
reported during execution. Second,the conflict type, origin and impact of an exception must be uncovered. Finally, depending on the nature of an exception, the
appropriate conflict negotiation and resolution strategy among the participating entities is implemented. An ontology enables modeling conflict types along
with related exceptions, negotiation and resolution strategies, thereby enabling
conflict management and resolution.
Ongoing contract enactments may also evolve [16] in an orderly way. In that
case, the assumption is that a collaborating party modifies an internal technical
process that matches with an externally exposed service offer. The latter is a
subset of the internal process so that business secrets remain private. Based on
a set of rules, such internal process changes may trigger varying changes of a
process view that may cross over into the domain of collaborating parties to the
degree of affecting other eCommunity-party internal processes. The objective is
to assure that a collaboration configuration remains sound in that the enactment
of a contract reaches the desired terminal state.
Finally, there is a clear need to bring different solutions from different technology and application domains together for a holistic design of cyberpysical systems
(CPS) [43]. CPS integrates computational and physical capabilities that allow
for interaction with humans through diverse means [3]. Such novel interaction
ways expand the capabilities of humans in correlation with the physical world
through computation, communication, and control as a key attraction feature of
CPS. For example, in domains in the design and development of next-generation
avionics and vehicles, smart cities, Industry 4.0, and so on. The flexible and
scalable governance of CPS raises the need for employing SACs where smart
contracts are combined with smart objects such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI)
agents [8].

2.2 Running case
A user story depicted in Figure 3 describes a process of making a rental agreement based on activities of a lessor and a lessee. Lessor is a person who is a
property owner or a person who represents a property owner and has a right
to make a rental agreement on behalf of an owner. We call him John. Property
in this use case scenario is what in legal terms is called an immovable, i.e., a
plot of land and anything permanently attached to the plot of land, such as a
house, an apartment, a condo or some other type of premises such as a garage,
a parking lot, a shed, i.e., it is a space that can be rented out. Property can also
be movable in legal terms such as, e.g., a trailer, or a tool. Lessee is a person
who is looking for property to rent for a long or a short period of time. We call
her Mary.

Fig. 3. The informal exchange protocol for (a) the contract initiation and (b) for
contract expiry and -termination. For (a), the lessee pays a deposit to the lessor and
next both sign a rent contract (act 1). The apartment keys are handed over to the
lessee for moving into the apartment, for which the lessee pays monthly rent. For (b),
a possession-retrieval act (act 2) is signed that may state the apartment is in the same
condition as for (a), the apartment keys are handed back to the lessor, the lessee moves
out and finally, the lessor pays back the deposit.

The lifecycle of a rental contract is divided into the following stages/phases:
a) preparatory, b) negotiations, c) contract execution e) rollback and e) a contract expiry stage. Following Figure 3, the preparation phase of a rental contract
is triggered upon a request from Mary who is looking, for example, for a suitable
apartment for the period of 12 months. At this stage, certain standard requirements of the contract have to be determined before John and Mary can proceed
to negotiate terms of the contract. Mary needs information about the owner of
the property and the apartment as John needs information about Mary. John’s
and Mary’s names, personal identification codes, addresses (data of the parties)

8

Alex Norta

must be included in the contract. The apartment has to be specified so that
its condition and status becomes colloquially apparent and formally defined for
John and Mary. The object of the contract is defined by characteristics of the
apartment such as location (address), size (square meters), intended purpose,
e.g., for living, storing, work and for instance whether a parking space or a
storage room outside this apartment is included.
Traditionally, Mary looks for information about apartments for rent from the
Internet, or she employs a real estate agent to negotiate terms of the contract
with John. This means she must spend time to look for information, make calls
and visits to find a suitable apartment to rent. A real estate agent would charge
a fee for his services.
The Agrello system provides an innovative approach. During the negotiation
phase, John has predefined essential terms of the contract (characteristics of the
rental object, time, price and rating of the lessee) and based on this information
he looks for the best match of a rental request. In the Agrello system, contract
conclusion between John and Mary is possible when a match occurs. If Mary
declines the offer, she indicates which factors she does consent with. Based on
this information John modifies the search criteria for a better match with the
modified requirements. The conclusion of the contract means that both parties
to the contract have expressed their will to conclude it, i.e., all parties have
signed it. This cannot be altered by any third party.
The contract execution phase begins with the documentation of the condition of the apartment. Traditionally, this refers to a possession transfer act that
includes information about the condition of the apartment, the recorded state of
utilities (water, electricity, heating) and the number of keys given to the lessee.
John must hand over the keys and Mary must pay the deposit for the apartment. After that, Mary is obliged to pay the monthly rent on time and to keep
the apartment in a good condition. If Mary fails to perform her monthly rent
payment then John has the right to claim a late payment charge. A rollback
situation occurs if, e.g., John can not provide the apartment any more, then
John must return the rent that Mary has payed up front.
The contract terminates if the expiry date of the contract arrives, or if the
contract is prematurely terminated. Consequently, the apartment is transferred
back to John. During the contract expiry phase, John expects that the condition
of the apartment is the same upon return as at the point of initial transferral to
Mary. The property-transfer procedure is similar to the description above and
the status of utilities must be recorded.

3 Self-Awareness of Contracts
The current smart-contract lingua franca is Solidity. It embodies a programming
language that industry practitioners without IT-skills do not comprehend, e.g.
lawyers. Therefore, it is not possible to defend such contracts in front of an
independent arbitrator due to a lack of suitability, utility and expressiveness in

Self-Aware Contracts

9

a legal context. For example, Solidity does not comprise language constructs that
resemble obligations and rights pertaining to the parties of a contract.
The purpose of CCs is to establish relationships and to govern the behavior
of contracting people, which requires sound constructs of obligations and rights.
With the emergence of CPS, smart contracts require the capability of reasoning
about rights and obligations, which the involvement of BDI-agents enables. Thus
we yield thereby SACs with scalable socio-technical application scenarios where
humans use technology for solving problems collaboratively. In CCs, a lawyer has
to look at a contract to check if a deadline was missed, or an obligation breached.
Self-awareness in this sense means that both entities, the CC and lawyer, merge
into one artifact being a software agent that comprises contract logics in the
form of machine-readable obligations. More precisely, the agent can deduce, e.g.,
missed deadlines from the obligations, and since we perceive the agent with the
obligations as a smart contract, we conclude a smart contract reasons about
itself.
The remainder is structured as follows. Section 3.1 discusses the ontological
concepts and properties of contractual obligations. Section 3.2 shows in a formal
way the processing of obligations by agents. Next, Section 3.3 explains the use
of BDI-agents in managing the contracts.
3.1 Contract Content
A SAC must comprise important elements of contracts to provide metadata
during the contract execution. This metadata can then be used in various ways
by informatics systems, but most importantly agents, which assist, automate and
manage contract execution. As mentioned above, rights and obligations must
be optimized for machine readability. We explain rights and obligations with
the running case of Section 2.2. Next, we show machine-readability for rights
and obligations while maintaining the capability for non-technical persons to
comprehend the smart rights and obligations based SAC.
Figure 4 depicts the class diagram of the Agrello-framework ontology10 . Several sub-class relationships exist to capture all essential contractual elements. For
example, we refine an obligation by adding as subclasses Monetary Obligation
and NonMonetary Obligation to express certain remedies are only available for
non-monetary obligations that can be a repair, or a replacement, while some are
monetary, e.g., late-payment charges. There exist also person subclasses such
as an Obligor who must perform an obligation, a Beneficiary who is benefiting
from the performance of an obligation and optionally, a Third Party as a beneficiary from the performance of an obligation, e.g., a utilities provider in a rental
contract.
The purpose of the Remedy subclasses in Figure 4 is to eliminate negative
consequences that result from a breach of the contract. Additionally, by invoking
remedies, a beneficiary achieves a situation if the obligation had been performed
10

correctly. For example, if the rental payment is delayed, the lessor can claim
late-payment Interest.
The Right subclasses are important as they reflect what a Beneficiary can
claim. For example, if a lessee destroys furniture in an apartment, the lessor has
the right to Claim Repair, or Claim Replacement. Finally, the State subclasses
in Figure 4 reflect the status of an Obligation performance in a contract lifecycle.

Fig. 5. Obligation-ontology graph.

With respect to class-references, we focus on obligations and rights. In Figure
5 the depicted graph shows the main ontological relationships for the Obligation

Self-Aware Contracts

11

class. In accordance with Figure 1, the depiction shows components that are
integrated with the ontology. More concretely, Figure 5 comprises an Obligor,
Beneficiary, Precondition, Action and a Deadline. Furthermore, a Remedy is
based on an Obligation and a Third Party fulfills an Obligation. A Claim, or
a Right may create and Obligation and finally, the latter follows lifecycle State
stages.
In Figure 5, a Precondition is an expression that must be fulfilled in order
for an Obligation to be enabled. An Action is the task an obliger must carry
out for the Beneficiary, e.g. pay the rent. An Action has two properties, namely
Action Type such as pay and the Action Object such as rent. The Deadline
states when an Obligation has to be performed.

Fig. 6. Right-ontology graph.

The next ontology graph of Figure 6 shows the static relationship of classes
related to Right. Related to Figure 2, the difference is that a Beneficiary has
Rights prescribed in a contract and a right to several Remedy instances if a
contract is breached. For example if the apartment is not returned by the lessee
in the condition it was in at the beginning of the contract, the lessor has the right
to claim repair, or replacement. Damages can always be claimed, irrespective of
the aforementioned rights. This can be the case if the lessor can not fulfill an
agreement with a subsequent lessee due to delays caused by necessary repairs.
3.2 Obligation Processing
During a contract lifecycle, obligations move through stages of processing. According to the ontology classes of Figure 4, those stages are inactive, active, performed, delayed, defective and terminated. Additionally, there exist the stages

12

Alex Norta

revised and unfulfillable, which is out of focus for the automation of obligation
processing. More precisely, we discuss the respective stages below:
– inactive: When an agent has not taken an obligation into consideration, i.e.,
the precondition of an obligation has not been met.
– active: An agent takes an obligation into consideration, i.e., the precondition
of an obligation is met. That infers an obligor has to perform the related action
before the deadline passes.
– performed: The action has been carried out by the obligor.
– delayed: The obligor has not carried out the action before the agreed deadline.
Delayed state presumes that the amount of the action object in the obligation
is not delivered to the beneficiary, or is not delivered in the sufficient amount.
– defective: The action object of an obligation is defective.
– terminated: The obligation can be terminated by a fundamental breach, or by
mutual agreement. No further consideration of the obligation will take place.
Following the CPN model in Figure 7, when an obligation is in the stages
delayed, or defective, a contractual agent starts reasoning about breaches to
notify a collaborating party about the rights to remedy breaches, or other options
for conflict resolution. In the delayed stage, the action object of the obligation
is not delivered before the deadline passes, or is not delivered in the sufficient
amount. For example the rent is not paid, or is paid less than required.
A defective distinction in Figure 7 shows monetary and non-monetary obligations. A monetary obligation includes a monetary action, while non-monetary
obligation includes an action with a non-monetary action object. For example, the obligation to pay rent is a monetary obligation and the obligation to
transfer the possession of an apartment is a non-monetary obligation. Only a
non-monetary obligation can enter into a defective obligation stage. The latter
requires the action object to lack the expected quality compared to agreement.
For example when the lessee returns the possession of the apartment to the
lessor without the apartment being in the agreed condition. In contrary to that,
an obligation to pay rent cannot have qualitative deficiencies, because rent as
the action object of the obligation has only quantitative features and does not
have any qualitative ones. Although being in the state performed, the obligation
can go to the state defective if defects are discovered in the aftermath.
The obligation stages delayed and defective in Figure 7 initiate rights to the
beneficiary of an obligation to claim remedies. The delayed stage can initiate
rights to claim performance, late-payment charges for monetary obligations and
a contractual fine for non-monetary obligations. The defective stage can only
be reached by non-monitory obligations and it allows the beneficiary to claim
repair, or replacement while also being able to claim damages.
When the remedies in Figure 7 do not enable the beneficiary to achieve the
purpose of the obligation performance, the obligation is fundamentally breached,
resulting in the obligation reaching the stage of terminated. This can initiate the
right for the beneficiary to cancel the contract. The obligation can also be put
into the stage terminated at any time by the mutual agreement of the parties.

3.3 Interacting Contract Agents
The running case of Section 2 for renting out apartments is further refined by
developing UML sequence diagrams, [46] depicting the interaction protocols of
agents. The first sequence diagram of Figure 8 is the refinement for Figure 3(a)
about the initiation of a rental contract while the second sequence diagram of
Figure 9 pertains to Figure 3(b) about the rental contract termination.
In Figure 8, we assign a fictitious public key number that comprises four
characters for readability. The three entities to the left represent a contractual
agent and two personal agents for the lessor and lessee respectively. The fourth
entity denotes the blockchain into which events are registered. Furthermore, we
assume a smart-home scenario where the apartment has four agents assigned,
one for the smart lock and three for the gas-, water- and electricity-smart meters
respectively.

14

Alex Norta

Fig. 8. Initiation protocol of contractual agents.

The sequence diagram in Figure 8 commences with the contract agent sending a message to the lessee agent about the obligation ob(dep) being active,
meaning that the deposit must be paid. Consequently, the lessee agent performs
the payment by invoking tx(dep, 7a30) to the blockchain, i.e., the deposit is held
by the contract agent. Note that usually a deposit is paid to a lessor’s account,
which is problematic as the lessor has the exclusive control over funds that he is
not entitled to unless there is damage done to the apartment. At times, the deposit is never paid back to the lessee, even when the apartment is in undamaged
condition. Still, in the case of a contract-agent wallet, the parties are forced to
find a consensus about the deposit.
The next message in Figure 8 is from the contract agent to the blockchain for
checking the unspent transaction output U T XO(7a30) to assure the deposit is
transferred to the contract-agent wallet onto the blockchain. The latter responds
with a confirmation – result(-B0.3) – indicating the payment to the contractagent’s public-key address on the blockchain.
For the formation of the transfer-act act1 in Figure 3, several types of information must be collected. First, the contract agent sends an active obligation
message ob(pt) to the lessor agent for requesting pictures of the apartment condition. The lessor agent responds by delivering those pictures. Next, value-query
messages qu(value) are sent by the contract agent to the gas-, water- and electricity agents respectively, who respond with sending back the current smart-meter

Self-Aware Contracts

15

counts in result(value)-messages. The latter are used by the contract agent in
combination with the pictures to generate act1 that is subsequently recorded in
the blockchain.
Next, the contract agent sends an active obligation message ob(key) to the
lessor agent who subsequently sends another message order(transfer,31x7) to the
smart-key agent, i.e., the smart key to the apartment is now usable by the lessee.
Note that by using the blockchain for smart-key assignment, it is possible to perform an assignment to multiple persons and the lessor is aware of their identity.
Finally, the contract agent sends an active obligation message ob(rentpay) to
the lessee agent, after which the latter sends a transaction tx(rent,03m6) to the
blockchain, i.e., the recipient of the first monthly rent payment is the lessor.

Fig. 9. Termination protocol of contractual agents.

The termination protocol for the apartment rental contract in Figure 9 commences with the contract agent sending an active obligation message ob(pic)
to the lessee agent who returns a set of pictures about the apartment conditions. Next, the smart-meter values are requested with qu(value)-messages from
the gas-, water- and electricity agents respectively. The latter respond with result(value)-messages from the respective smart meters. Assuming the delivered
pictures about the apartment condition are accepted by the lessor, the contract
agent invokes the command act2(pic,value1,value2,value3). The generated act2
is recorder into the blockchain and the contract agent sends an active obliga-

16

Alex Norta

tion message ob(key) to the lessee agent, indicating the apartment smart key
must be returned to the lessor. Consequently, the lessee agent sends a message
order(transfer,03m6) to the smart-key agent.
The contract agent informs the lessor agent with the message right(damage
claim) that there should be a final confirming check for possible damage compensation. We assume in Figure 9 that no damage compensation occurs and
subsequently, the contract agent sends an active obligation message ob(dep) to
the lessor for indicating the deposit must be paid back to the lessee. For that, the
lessor agent sends a transaction message tx(dep,31x7) to the blockchain. Finally,
the contract agent sends a check command UTXO(7a30) to the blockchain, after which the latter responds with the message result(-B0.3), i.e., the deposit has
successfully been returned to the lessee.

4 Manageability of Self-Aware Contracts
The aim of the Agrello-framework is to increase the productivity of informationand value logistics. Important is an understanding of the lifecycle that must
be in place for creating, enacting, rolling back and orderly terminating SACs.
Consequently, Section 4.1 describes the SAC lifecycle, followed by Section 4.2
that focuses on the involvement of BDI-agents in the lifecycle. Finally, Section
4.3 discusses human-interaction means with the SAC lifecycle.
4.1 Lifecycle of Self-Aware Contracts
For the lifecycle in Figure 10, we use again BPMN notation. The lifecycle commences with the need to establish a peer-to-peer (P2P) contract collaboration
between several parties. The first sub-process is for preparing [34] a contract
template that is equipped with service types and affiliated agent roles. Thus,
we assume a library exists of third-party generated rental contract templates
where predefined parameters are inserted, such as for the upper- and the lower
bound of rent that an apartment should be offered for. Next, the service types
are populated by concrete service-offers from agents that fill specific roles. For
the running case of this paper, the roles are lessor and lessee, a blockchain, the
smart key, and the utility agents for gas, water and electricity.
Using a SAC approach has advantages over the traditional renting situation as follows. In the latter case, the lessor usually determines who the utility providers are and the lessee is on the receiving end paying to the lessor.
In the case of SACs, it is possible to avail specific roles and service types for
competing potential providers. For example, if a lessee is conscious about the
environment and disagrees with a preset gas agent, there can be provisions
to have environmentally friendly alternative providers compete for being gasservice providers. Consequently, fine-tuned free-market competition during the
rental-contract preparation phase increases the likelihood of finding an optimal
service-provider quorum.

Self-Aware Contracts

17

Fig. 10. The Agrello-lifecycle of SACs.

The negotiation sub-process in Figure 10 allows the agents to set concrete
prices within the predefined ranges. After assembling a proto-contract, each
agent receives a copy for deciding on a negotiation outcome. There are three
decision options that may occur during the negotiation. First, the lessee agent
may disagree with a set monthly rent rate and proposes a different number in a
counteroffer. This implies that new copies must be assigned to each agent for a
new negotiation round. Second, an agent considers the proto-contract disagreeable and collapses the negotiation. In this case, the lifeycle reaches the lifecycle
end. Third, all agents agree and create a SAC agent.
The initiation phase [35] in Figure 10 commences when the contract agent
exists but the establishment of a decentralized governance infrastructure (DGI)
is required for the subsequent enactment as well. Note that the initiation phase
matches with the sequence-diagram protocol of Figure 8. The DGI-establishment
involves the distribution of obligation sets that are derived from the contract
agent to the respective agents. Additionally, monitors are assigned together with
contract-monitoring agents (CMA) that observe if obligations are adhered to. In
cases of obligation breaches, a CMA reports to the contract agent and rollback
steps commence that we explain below. Finally, preparing for rental-contract
enactment means that private processes for each collaborating agent are set up
on a technical level and communication endpoints are established where clarity
exists on the meaning of exchanged heterogeneous data sets.
During the enactment phase in Figure 10, the lessee pays monthly apartment
rent to the blockchain. The earlier established CMAs monitor if the lessee agent
adheres to the deadlines of obligations. In case of an obligation violation [24, 35],
a voting procedure commences to establish if the obligation breach is fundamental, or if merely an obligation revision is required. For the running case, a breach
occurs when the lessee pays rent late or not at all. Assuming the rent payment

18

Alex Norta

includes also the payment of monthly utility costs, the voting involves the lessor
agent and the utility agents for gas, water and electricity. We assume the voting
power is determined by the proportional amount of payment that are part of the
monthly rent payment of the lessee.
In case the lessee refuses to pay, the voting outcome is a fundamental breach.
Consequently, the contract is renegotiated to hopefully clarify issues that result
in not paying rent. Note that a renegotiation involves a partial termination of the
flowing business semantics and a targeted rollback of the remaining subset into
the negotiation component. Still, the existing contract remains intact during the
renegotiation phase. If a renegotiation fails, the ongoing rental-contract businesssemantics flow is fully terminated and the involved agents are equally terminated.
If the lessee is late with the monthly rental payment to the blockchain, the
vote outcome is likely to demand payment on the one hand, and interest in
addition on the other hand. We assume revision of the obligation takes place
to see if it possibly does not match the rental context any longer, e.g., the
lessee receives salary later and consequently, can only pay monthly rent later
too. In that case, the obligation adjustment is inserted during a rollback to
the initiation phase and the ongoing contract continues. Finally, the full rentalcontract termination phase involves a takedown of the DGI and follows the
protocol of Figure 9. Thus, all agents are released from the collaboration and
equally terminated.
4.2 BDI-Agent Involvement
The agents shown in Figure 10 fulfill specific roles for the self-aware rental contract. The contract agent (CA) operates on behalf of the housing agency and
coordinates the remaining agents after its creation at the end of the preparation
stage when the other agents of Figure 8 consent on a rental-contract establishment. The responsibilities are to allow for deducing a DGI so that the lessorand the lessee agents comprise local sets of obligations. The CA also coordinates
the CMAs that observe locally on behalf of the CA if the local obligation sets
are adhered to. Furthermore, the CA has responsibilities during the initiation
phase of Figure 10 that follow the sequence diagram of Figure 8. During the
execution phase, the CA listens to the CMA and if the rent payment is not performed in an orderly way, the responsibility of the former is to trigger a voting
procedure that leads to earlier explained rollback results. Finally, the CA also
captures the termination request for the rental contract of the lessor, or lessee
and triggers the overall DGI-dismantling. Essential CA-constraints are that the
roles of the contract template must all be populated in the preparation stage
with corresponding agents. The latter must reach a consensus so that a CA is
instantiated for a DGI-setup. Important is also that the data for act1 creation is
delivered as requested, i.e., pictures and gas-, water- and electricity values from
the utility agents. Another constraint is that all votes are cast as required during
the rollback phase.
The lessor- and lessee agents both have the responsibilities to populate a corresponding role with an affiliated service type in a contract template during the

Self-Aware Contracts

19

preparation phase. Next, both agents must participate in the negotiation phase
and provide counteroffers, disagreements, or agreements for consensus formation.
Both, lessor- and lessee agents, have the responsibility to cooperate for facts
collecting that leads to the establishment of act1 and act2 in accordance with
Figure 8 and Figure 9 respectively during the initiation phase. The lessor agent
has the responsibility to transfer the smart key to the lessee. During the execution phase, it is the responsibility of the lessee agent to pay monthly rent onto
the blockchain. When the latter obligation is not adhered to, the lessee agent is
obliged to cooperate with the rollback procedure and must either agree with a
new obligation to continue in the rental contract, or pay damage and compensation if a fundamental breach occurs. The lessor agent has the responsibility
to cooperate in the rollback voting procedure if the CA detects a breach that a
CMA reports.
The constraint of the lessee agent is the ability to pay the deposit during
the initiation phase, the rent during the execution phase, possible damages and
compensations during the rollback phase. For the termination, the constraint for
the lessee agent is that the delivered photos display an apartment condition that
is similar to when the lessee moved in and if the condition is lower, the lessee
agent must pay compensation to the blockchain address of the lessor agent. The
constraint of the lessor agent during the initiation phase is delivering pictures to
the CA that document the apartment condition and fails to transfer the smart
key to the lessee within an acceptable time limit. During the termination phase,
the lessor agent must detect damages in the apartment within an acceptable
time limit.
The utility agents for gas-, water- and electricity have the responsibility to fill
their respective roles in the contract template during the preparation phases and
must report current meter values during the initiation phase. In case the lessee
agent fails to pay the rent where we assume the utility expenses are a part of
it, the utility agents must participate in the rollback voting procedure. Finally,
during the termination phase, the utility agents must again deliver meter values
for the finalization of act2 (Figure 9). The constraints are, that utility agents
fail to adhere to their responsibilities within given time limits.
The smart-key agent has the responsibility to accept being assigned to lesses
during the initiation phase and being transferred back to the lessor during the
termination phase. Otherwise, the smart-key agent does not have any additional
responsibilities during the SAC lifecycle of Figure 10. The only constraint for the
smart-key agent is to immediately respond to user-change commands. Finally,
the blockchain is not an agent but merely an immutable event record-ledger for
the rental contract lifecycle.
4.3 Means of Human Interaction
The organization model of Figure 11 shows human involvement in the collaboration for the running-case rental contract. An organization model is part of
the agent-oriented modeling notation [49] and denotes the relationships between
human- and BDI-agents. The arcs between the agents specify the relationship

20

Alex Norta

types. In Figure 11 we use Controls to show a subordinate relationship between
agents, IsPeerTo to define equal roles and IsBenevolentTo as a relationshp between self-interested agent roles. Additionally in Figure 11, we specify that a
utility agent can be either a gas-, water-, or electricity agent.

Fig. 11. The organizational model for the rental contract.

The human involvement as specified in Figure 11 takes place via dedicated
assisting BDI-agents. For example, the lessee agent engages in the rental contract
on behalf of the lessor, who is a human individual. The gas agent acts in the rental
contract on behalf of a utility company that provides gas to the apartment. The
respective assisting BDI-agents that act for human agents are under coordinating
control of the contract agent that are in turn under the control of a housing
company. Finally, the smart-key agent is under alternating control of the lessor-,
or the lessee agent with respect to shifting the human-agent ownership.

5 Trusting Contract Elements
Contract immutability and legal viability are related to several problems. Immutability not only implies to store the machine-readable and agent-executable
contract with its obligations so that it cannot be changed. It is also necessary to
store the events, e.g., payments that affect contract-execution immutably. With
conventional contracts, these events are for example receipts, emails, or phone
calls, e.g., from lessor to lessee. Immutability of these events prevents situations

Self-Aware Contracts

21

where two parties claim the opposite about whether a payment is performed, or
not. It is also a prerequisite to allow for an agent-aided review of the contract
execution. A separate contract agent is fed with the contract in question and
connected to the event-storing repository. The agent commences in the past,
consumes relevant events and processes the obligations of the contract to the
present. Besides immutability of value, this entails that events are immutably
timestamped.
The remainder is structured as follow. Section 5.1 comprises essential elements for the setup of SACs. Section 5.2 gives technical details about executing
contracts. Section 5.3 describes additional trusted events for contract execution
and finally, Section 5.4 explains the contextual trustworthiness for contract integration.
5.1 Elements of Trust
In order to support the execution of self-aware smart-contracts with blockchain
technology, various elements are necessary. First of all, the contract has to be
signed by the contract parties. Essential elements for enacting blockchain enhanced self-aware smart-contracts are:
Identity: the contract parties must be unambiguously identifiable. Especially
the lessor in a rent contract wants assurance that the flat is used by the
person who (or who’s agent) reacts to the lessor’s offer. Assuming that one
person with a positive credit rating reacts to a flat offer while the identity
used for contract signing cannot be verified, the intended lessee could instead
let another person with insufficient credit rating move into the flat, e.g., a
friend, or family member.
Signature: conventional contracts require a hand written signature. To achieve
comparable, or better legal commitment, digital and cryptographically secure
signatures are necessary.
Events: as stated above, access to external events related to the contract obligations is essential for automated execution. In case the contract agent is to
sense that a rent happens for a specific month, it either has to be externally
informed about such an event with a push message, or must be able to query
a blockchain that stores such events as a pull message. Alternatively, an agent
with blockchain connection to the blockchain relays the information transitively. The different types of events are not necessarily stored on the same
blockchain as, e.g., sensor data from smart meters, or access permissions for
the smart lock may require a different blockchain.
Timestamp: the SAC together with agents and obligations considers external
events to process obligations, e.g., payments. To reason about delays and
deadlines, events consumed by the contract agent need to be time stamped.
Contract source code: the source code of the contract contains its obligation in a
formal and machine-readable notation. To guarantee immutability, the contract source code and the corresponding hash must reside on the blockchain.
In case a contract party claims defective contract execution by the agent

22

Alex Norta

because of manipulated source code, an original copy must exist to resolve
such conflicts. Storing the hash on the blockchain is only sufficient if at least
one contract party provides source code with the same hash value. An edge
case occurs when both parties can not provide a copy of the contract.
5.2 Contract Execution
Regarding legal viability, it has to be considered where the execution of the
contract takes place. Examples for related issues are, the number of independent
nodes running the contract and the problem of on- versus off-chain execution.
Unlike Etherum smart contracts, SACs do not require external events, or
the progress of obligation executions to be stored on a blockchain. It is legally
sufficient to merely store transactions between contract parties on a blockchain.
Still, the current state of SAC execution can always be derived from blockchainstored information.
Processing the rent-payment obligation of Listing 1 requires handling logics
of deadlines. Thus, the obligation (l.1-4 ) states that the lessee (obligor) has to
pay monthly rent to the lessor (beneficiary). The time token (l.6 ) is stored in the
agents belief base to trigger the processing of the recurring o6 obligation. In an
agent-orient approach, the respective code is provided as a library, or module for
which Listing 2 provides an excerpt. In l.1-9: the plan handles the instantiation
of the rent payment obligation each first day of a month. In l.12-17:, to acquire
the date for the following month, this plan is used. The plan in l.20-30: is invoked
by lines 1-9 with the purpose to create an event inside the agent that triggers
the creation of a concrete obligation at the beginning of the following month.
Thus, the event triggers plan l.1-9 again. If the event occurs, a term such as in
Listing 1, l.6 is added to the belief base.

The logic of this micro lifecycle described in Listing 1 is based on the declarative and logic programming facilities the Jason agent framework11 comprises.
Integrating the agent with the blockchain leads to a trade-off raising the question
of whether to run the contract agent on-, or off-chain.
Off-chain: running the SAC off-chain requires storage on a server for the execution by the agent framework. This entails, that the agent framework provides
means for communicating with the blockchain. The Jason framework with its

More precisely: AgentSpeak is a logic- and declarative programming language. Jason
agents are written in AgentSpeak and running them means that the source code is
interpreted by the Jason framework.

Self-Aware Contracts

reasoning cycle is implemented in Java and allows for extending it with handwritten code, i.e., using a library for interfacing with the blockchain. For this
to work, the blockchain has to provide an up-to-date API that also introduces
a dependency on it for the agent, not to speak of Java being involved. The offchain approach does not require any adaption, or change of the used blockchain,
but only the API.

On-chain: comparable to Ethereum smart contracts. For obligation driven
contracts, it is not necessary to write any state information to the blockchain.
The contract execution is driven by events such as payments that need to be
stored on the blockchain. Executing the contract requires keeping the execution
state in the memory of the machine/hardware for execution. The higher degree of abstraction that a logic- and declarative programming language such as
AgentSpeak yields, introduces the necessity for a reasoning cycle, e.g., reacting
to percepts, and a reasoner for unifying terms. To run a SAC on-chain, these
components have to be implemented in the virtual machine of the blockchain
that requires developing a new language 12 . This eliminates the need for API
integration into an agent. Another advantage is the encapsulation and hiding of
the hand-written code that comprises the mirco-lifecycle for general obligation
processing as in excerpt in Listing 2.
12

Another way to tackle this problem is introducing an intermediate language based
on π-calculus.

24

Alex Norta

An open issue is the relation between declarative and imperative programming in smart contracts. The SAC language we aim for is based on obligations and a more static and declarative approach. This leaves open the question
whether logics like voting protocols/algorithms can also be covert this way.
The question arises which parties run the contract agent. On the one hand,
contract details may not be accessible to the public while on the other hand, the
idea of blockchain is to distribute information for tampering protection and traceability. One solution is that each contract party runs a light node for contractcode enactment that only stores those transactions related to the contract and
its parties.
5.3 Trusted Events
When a SAC is executed, not only events like payments are involved. The agent,
reasoning about obligations, also needs to keep track of fine grained information
bits. If a recurring obligation must be processed such as for a monthly rental
payment, the agent must create a concrete obligation13 each first of a month,
containing the according date (Listing 2 line 3).
The agent senses its environment checking the current date and recognizes
that the recurring obligation has to be instantiated since the date is the first of
the month. This creates additional information the contract agent requires to
appropriately process the obligations. In contrast to payment events and given
signatures, or value transfers, this information does not require storage in the
blockchain and can be restored by restarting the contract agent, e.g., starting a
second instance to review contract execution.
5.4 Contextual Trustworthiness
Self-aware contracts can be integrated with their context to different degrees.
For a rental contract, an especially high degree of integration is computing the
monthly utilities by reading the consumption of electricity and water from smart
meters. This raises difficulties on several levels.
Security: IoT devices have repeatedly been subject to serious security vulnerabilities14 . Paying utilities automatically may cause inconveniences for a lessee
13

We clarify the terminology of recurring and concrete obligations. In a rental contract,
there is only one obligation for paying the rent monthly. However, for processing,
this obligation must be split into parts (instances) simplifying the task for the agent.

of a flat. The logics for recognizing and handling faulty sensor data must be
introduced to the contract agent. A privacy concern is the secure transfer of
sensitive measurement data.
Interoperability: when integrating technologies from different technical domains15 such as software agents, blockchains, smart devices/IoT, a considerable challenge is data exchange. This not only relates to syntactic interoperability so that exchanged data can be parsed by the counter-party with
correct data formats. The semantic interoperability for data exchange must
also be clarified, e.g., a temperature measured in ◦ C is mistakenly interpreted as ◦ F ?). Sound data exchange also involves architectural aspects.
The question arises if the contract agent receives the sensor data from another software agent that acts as a proxy for the IoT devices and provides
a uniform interface, or is accessing the smart meters hard coded into the
agent.
Our notion of SACs is based on obligations and we refer to the P2P economy
throughout the white paper. Nevertheless, the idea of obligations stems from
contract law that not only covers P2P scenarios such as for the rental-contract
case. Obligations are also applicable for business-to-business scenarios. We anticipate a framework that is scalable for business-to-business (B2B) cases without
considerable changes to the core concepts, e.g., sale of goods, or services.

6 Feasibility Evaluation
We map the running rent-contracting case of Section 2 into an evaluation that
comprises three parts. First, Section 6.1 gives an architecture of the Agrello
framework. Next, Section 6.2 shows code of the Agrello language for several aspects of the SAC, which includes examples for obligations and rights. Section 6.3
shows a conceptual Agrello graphical user-interface prototype that is currently
under development.
6.1 System Architecture
The Agrello-system architecture in Figure 12 we derive from from [37] where
the so-called eSourcing Reference Architecture (eSRA) is introduced for crossorganizational process-aware collaboration. We use a simplified form of a UMLcomponent diagram model [4] for the architecture depiction. Briefly, eSourcing
establish outsourcing relationships by supporting matchmaking between offered
and requested process views [17] that allows for a stepwise collaboration evolution if contextual changes require it. Furthermore, in [32] we show how software
agents enable communication for conflict resolution in P2P- and process-aware
collaborations. These agents act autonomously on behalf of collaborating organizations a SAC orchestrates with the assurance that information used for

conflict resolution is trustworthy. Note that business processes can be mapped
onto Solidity [52] for blockchain-based enactment.

Fig. 12. Agrello-system architecture in a simplified bi-lateral cross-organizational collaboration scenario.

The architecture in Figure 12 shows a set of components that are organized
with a layered architecture. We assume to the left and right are two respective
collaborating parties. However, the eSourcing approach scales so that Agrello
supports the P2P multi-party running case [15, 16] from Section 2. In the middle of Figure 12 is a component that comprises Agrello contract templates in a
repository hub [38]. The hub allows for finding contract templates that a GUI
displays in human-readable language during the preparation of a contract template in correspondence to Figure 10. A user parameterizes the template and
a mapping creates a representation into an XML-based based equivalent based
on the eSourcing Markup Language (eSML) [39] that we extend with obligations and rights into AgrelloLanguage in accordance with Section 3. Note that
for the population and negotiation phases in accordance with Figure 10, the
collaboration components are employed.
The layers in Figure 12 are as follows. The external layer comprises a respectively replicated collaboration component that synchronizes via a contained
coordination interface with the equal component of counter-parties. The collaboration component also serves as a security-ensuring gateway for P2P data
exchange. Furthermore, embedded are additional components to negotiate SACs
specified in AgrelloLanguage with affiliated obligations and rights. For that, functionalities are necessary to perform reputation-, identity-, and action management related to SAC involvement. The collaboration component also contains
BDI-agents that act on behalf of a concrete collaborating party, as we explain
above. A coordinator component assures during the enactment phase that SACs
align the execution on obligations, rights and the the process aspect.
The contract-template hub comprises several embedded components too.
Identity-management- and reputation management functionalities complement
the collaboration components of respective collaborating counter-parties. Bid-

ding services receive auctioning- and tendering input from the collaboration management. To quickly deploy contracts, libraries for SAC templates, obligations
and rights exist. Important is also that the templates must be validated with
tool support for soundness, i.e., syntactic and semantic deficiencies elimination.
The conceptual layer is internal to collaborating parties and shielded by the
external layer from information exchange with counter-parties. The contained
SAC setup support comprises libraries with smart-contract parts, obligations
and rights that modeling tools can use for rapidly creating SACs. The composed
SAC is simulated and verified internally for soundness, i.e., for eliminating design errors. Note that simulation is inferior to verification as most likely not
all execution paths of a SAC are tested. In contrast, verification employs formal methods and sophisticated tool support for a complete correctness check
of SACs. The setup support also comprises development tools for issuing BDIagents that externally represent a collaborating party. The translator component
relays between the external- and internal layer that we explain below.
As [37] shows in detail, the translator must reconcile different standards and
formats that are used in terms of modeling notations and information types.
While the external- and conceptual layers are provided by the Agrello framework,
the internal layer comprises concrete smart contract systems, e.g., Ethereum [53],
Lisk16 , Hyperledger [12], Qtum17 , and so on. Thus, we assume a blockchain agnostic position and must map to a heterogeneous set of smart-contract languages,
mostly slight variations of Solidity [13].
6.2 Agrello Language
We show the high-level structure of the business-collaboration language we call
AgrelloLanguage that is derived from the research-driven and pre-existing eSourcing Markup Language (eSML) [39] schema as a foundation. AgrelloLanguage
is given in Extensible Markup Language (XML) [9] to facilitate the building of
distributed applications in Clouds [11].
Figure 13 shows the structure of AgrelloLanguage as a SAC between collaborating parties, structuring the AgrelloLanguage content into the conceptual
blocks Who, Where, and What. Briefly, the Who block comprises constructs
for the resource definition and the data definition. Mapped onto the running
apartment-renting case, parts of the resource definition are the housing company, the utility smart meters, and related information. Note that BDI-agents
count as resources and are therefore defined with an unique identifier and universal resource identifier (URI) [26].
The Where block defines the business context in terms of used business, legal, and geographical aspects are of importance for the contractual relations of
collaborating parties. In the context of the renting case, we assume Estonian jurisdiction holds. More concretely, the business-context provisions comprise obligations and rights that are assigned to concrete process tasks we explain below.

Fig. 13. AgrelloLanguage structure for SAC formulation.

The legal context provisions allow for setting general terms and conditions for a
contract.
In the What block, the current adoption of a formal process-specification
language permits the use of control-flow patterns for business-process definitions that have semantic clarity [36]. Note that the process definitions comprises
constructs for linking to the resource- and data-definition sections of AgrelloLanguage that are both based on respective pattern collections [48, 47]. Furthermore,
life-cycle definitions [33] are for the business processes and contained tasks.
Since the Agrello framework is blockchain agnostic, the mapping assures
that heterogeneous organizational-internal smart-contract platforms can be integrated cross-organizationally. Thus, the life-cycle-mapping establishes semantic
equivalence between the life-cycles of the cross-organizationally harmonized business processes and of tasks from the opposing domains. Different labels of tasks
belonging to processes of opposing domains may be semantically equal. To establish a semantic equality, the second part of the mapping block focuses on
the mapping of task labels. The monitoring construct of Figure 13 specifies how
much of the enactment phase the service consumer perceives. We refer the reader
to [33] for further details.
For the running rental case, we give brief AgrelloLanguage code examples
for obligations and rights. Listing 3 shows an example for the obligation to pay
monthly rent. We assume the obligation has a name and unique ID, can not be
changed throughout the enactment of a SAC and involves monetary units for
the execution.
The state of the obligation in Listing 3 is enabled, i.e., the SAC enactment
is at a lifecycle stage where the obligation is active. Next, the parties of the
obligations define as a beneficiary the lessor. Note, we use the shrunk public key

Self-Aware Contracts

29

number of the lessor wallet from Figure 8. The same holds for the lessee who is
defined as the obligor and must pay the monthly rent. There is no third party
involved in this obligation. Following Figure 1, the obligation type is todo in that
the lessee has to act by concretely paying the rent.
Listing 3. Obligation example for paying monthly rent.

25
< remedy >
26
late_payment_interest ( amount ,03 m6 ,31 x7 )
27
</ remedy >
28 </ obligation_rule >

As a precondition for the obligation in Listing 3, the act1 must be signed
by the lessor and lessee while the latter must have access to the smart key for
being able to move into the apartment. The action type is the payment from the
wallet of the lessee to the lessor that constitutes the type rent. Additionally, and
conforming to Figure 1, the action object is defined as the rent with the qualifiers
it must be serviced monthly for a specific amount. The rule condition is that the
rent payment must occur on the last day of a month. Finally, a reference is
inserted in the obligation that a remedy for late rent payment exists where the
lessee must transfer a defined monetary amount to the lessor.
The right in Listing 4 comprises intersecting specification elements with an
obligation. As pointed out in Section 2, the main difference with an obligation is
the the beneficiary may waive a right. We assume in the right example of Listing
4 the hypothetical case the lessee has broken a television for which the lessor is
the owner.
The right is again defined by a corresponding name and ID. As the lessor
has the right to waive the right e.g., in case the lessee convinces the lessor the
television damage is not her fault even when no evidence exists, the right can
be changed on the fly and the compensation is set to f alse as the expectation
is a full replacement of the object. The right is in the lifecycle state enabled for
immediate enactment and the parties are similarly defined as in Listing 3.

30

Alex Norta

Corresponding to Figure 2, the type of the right is set to claim pertaining to
the lessor over the lessee for a replacement of the broken television. The assumed
precondition is again that act1 is signed and the smart-key handover to the lessee
took place. The action type is a replacement of the television that is defined as
an object by brand,type and serial number.

We assume that the replace() command must be confirmed via mobile phone
by the lessee with a photo showing the television being delivered to the mobile
phone of the lessor. The obligation in Listing 4 also has a certain date set as a
deadline for the television replacement. Otherwise, the lessee must again service
a remedy payment of a certain amount to the wallet of the lessor.
6.3 Agrello User Interface
The objective of the Agrello-framework is to allow for an intuitive development of SACs that are mapped to technical lower-level representations in AgrelloLanguage that is further mapped onto, e.g., Solidity to operate directly on a
blockchain. In the conceptual interface depiction of Figure 14, a template builder
shows to the left SAC-blocks to drag and drop into a contract window at the
bottom right. At the top right of Figure 14, a window for parameterizing the
blocks shows, e.g., the amount parameter is set to $1.750 as monthly rent.
The bottom left of Figure 14 depicts functions that represent actions in a contract a respective party must carry out. For example, the variables and functions
are used in the contract template at the bottom right comprising the function

rent involving specified variables lessor and lessee over a variable apartment.
More concretely, the contract window shows an assembled obligation in which
the defined lessor agrees to rent the apartment to the lessee during the specified
period for the amount of $1.750 per month.

7 Conclusions
This whitepaper presents a novel cross-organizational blockchain-agnostic framework for peer-to-peer collaboration that is based on ca. 15 years of academic
research stemming from the first author. With the emergence of cyber-physical
systems, a potential arises to reduce costs and time spent on information- and
value-transfer logistics that so far humans have managed. Novel blockchain technology enabled smart contracts, combined with intelligent multi-agent systems
and internet-of-things devices, yield so-called self-aware contracts that allow for
a high degree of automation for such peer-to-peer collaborations. We demonstrate the approach in a running case for renting an apartment that is first presented with traditional protocols for initiating and terminating a rental contract.
Since existing blockchain-based solutions lack essential constructs for specifying
legally binding, machine-readable contracts, we pragmatically formalize obligations and rights with an ontology. The running case is next mapped onto an
automated protocol where belief-desire-intention agents act on behalf of humans
who can consequently focus on decision making via mobile devices. For processing obligations and rights, a high-level state-transition automata in Colored Petri
Nets shows the processing semantics involving a blockchain that assures event

32

Alex Norta

traceability. Next, AgentSpeak code-samples indicate the way how belief-desireintention agents act on behalf of humans to facilitate information- and valuetransfer logistics. Important is that the AgrelloLanguage constitutes a high-level,
cross-organizational, declarative way of formulating self-aware contracts that are
human readable and comprise specifications of obligations and rights, which are
mapped onto organization-internal smart-contract transaction-processing platforms using, e.g., Solidity.
We discover that the combination of belief-desire-intention agents together
with the declarative AgrelloLanguage yields self-aware contracts where the former assure as a combined set trusted information is channelled into contractbased collaborations. That way, the agents create a composed oracle governed
by a lifecycle-management layer. The latter comprises the stages for preparing
a self-aware contract template, initiating the setup phase of a collaboration, enacting a contract, managing rollbacks that are caused by e.g., a breach of an
obligation, or the deliverance of faulty information by an agent, and an orderly
termination of a self-aware contract collaboration.
In addition to employing agents that provide a degree of artificial intelligence in a collaboration, human manageability of the Agrello framework we
achieve by providing a declarative smart-contract language that specifies crossorganizational contract-collaborations. This AgrelloLanguage is based on a preexisting language that results from an EU-project for initially automating crossorganizational production processes. The AgrelloLanguage provides extensions
by adopting human-readable specifications for obligations and rights, which are
core concepts for lawyers to establish traditional contracts for legal viability. Additionally, an intuitive user interface allows for assembling self-aware contracts
with building blocks for subsequent parameterization.
Immutability for legal viability the Agrello framework achieves by employing blockchain capability. Contracting parties must be signed digitally after the
parties’ identities are authenticated. Furthermore, relevant external events are
stored on the blockchain together with their respective timestamps that are critical for assuring legal traceability. Also the actual contract code itself we store
on the blockchain to guarantee immutability. We recognize that by involving
agents, it is possible to process events off-chain and on-chain. That way, we
achieve a fine-tuned load balancing where only important events are stored in
the blockchain for non-repudiable traceability.
As future work we aim to develop a mapping from AgrelloLanguage obligations and rights to lower-level so-called smart contract languages such as Soldity that operate directly on blockchain platforms. Furthermore, we investigate
a scalable agent-based solution for solving the Oracle problem pertaining to
blockchains where a scalable approach assures trusted information is channeled
into a self-aware contract collaboration. Important is that the Oracle must be
self-healing in that on the fly modifications of its constituents are possible in
cases of malevolent agent behavior, or contextual changes. Relevant for user
adoption is also the design of intuitive graphical user interfaces that allow for

laymen such as lawyers, business people, and so on, the development of specific
contracts based on human readable templates.

Development Plan

Introduction
Aragon is everything you need to run organizations (companies, NGOs, foundations, open
source projects...) on the Ethereum blockchain. It implements features like a cap table,
token transfers, voting, roles, fundraising and accounting. Aragon organizations are easily
customizable, and they are also extensible by installing third party modules.
Aragon organizations will be able to opt-in into the Aragon Network, which will provide
services like upgradeability and a decentralized court arbitration system for Aragon
organizations.
For more information, please refer to our website our dapp white paper and our Network
whitepaper.
This document describes how Aragon Dev plans to develop the Aragon dapp, the Aragon
Network and how Aragon Dev is positioned in the larger context of the Aragon project.

History & Vision

Luis and Jorge have been dreaming of a decentralized world for years. They met via Twitter
when they were only 15 years old, and immediately started building products together.
At the age of 17, they prototyped a fully decentralized Internet replacement by using mesh
networks, blockchain technology and protocols like Bluetooth LE and WiFi Direct.
Stampery—Luis’ latest company—made blockchain timestamping accessible, and has
worked with institutions like the Estonian government, Microsoft and Telefonica. It
participated in TechCrunch Disrupt and was backed by billionaire Tim Draper.
Luis has also been recognized as a 30 Under 30 by Forbes and Innovator Under 35 by the
MIT.
Before building Aragon, Luis and Jorge were in Silicon Valley working on solving the problem
of patent trolls with Unpatent. After figuring out how broken the underlying infrastructure of
innovation is—patent trolls thriving, Donald Trump winning the elections, bureaucracy
eating entrepreneurship—they decided to focus all of their time in building the
infrastructure that new companies and organizations will run on top of.

When talking about Aragon, taking a step back and thinking about the why of organizational
structures like companies is a sane move.
Firms or companies exist in order to create value by using resources to create products or
provide services.
However, intermediaries and third parties such as governments decrease the output of
those organizations by imposing restrictions and creating complex regulatory frameworks.
Aragon was born to disintermediate the creation and maintenance of companies and other
organizational structures.
Luis and Jorge were very inspired by Nobel prize Ronald Coase and his amazing paper The
Nature of the Firm and Yochai Benkler's Linux and the Nature of the Firm. Both explore the
concept of company.
At Aragon Dev, we believe that the blockchain and the Internet are changing the incentives
for companies to exist, and we are building tools for the next generation of companies that
will take advantage of these changes.
However, for decentralized organizations to be widespread, we need to make sure that they
are easy to use, upgradeable/durable and able to resolve human disputes.
We want to solve—either us or partnering with others—those points in order to make
decentralized organizations widespread.
And, thanks to the Aragon dapp and the Aragon Network, we can solve those points.

the Aragon Network is fully operational, from where the full governance of the Network will
be transferred to the ANT holders.
Aragon Dev, a for-profit corporation that will be founded after the token sale is finished, and
will serve the Foundation and employ a team that will work on the Aragon platform. It will
also serve as a service provider for the Aragon Network.
Funding Priorities It is intended that the Foundation will deploy the revenue from the token
sale as depicted in the Intended Use of Revenue document, but it reserves the right to make
changes if it deems them necessary.

Development Milestones
We will divide development milestones in the form of releases.
Each release may have multiple deployment stages, from being in alpha stage—running on
the test network—to begin in the production stage—running on the main network—going
through multiple testing, security and QA stages.

0.1 — The Initial Release

This the first release on macOS after months of work and weeks of privately-conducted
community testing. Featured all the basic functionality that an organization needs to
operate. It was not made public.

Release Calendar
• Private Alpha: February 2017

aragon.one

0.3 — The Governance Release

This version added the Bring your own token functionality, that allows using Aragon with any
ERC20 token as a governance token—ERC20 is a token standard allows everyone to
interface with a variety of tokens in a common way. It also added two new bylaws, specific
address only and ask oracle contract for confirmation—stepping stone for more dynamic
bylaws.
It introduced delegate voting and creation of custom, complex stock classes.
It featured new iconography, notable startup time improvements and web browser support
for using it with Ethereum browsers/clients like Mist, Parity, MetaMask, Status etc.

Release Calendar
• Alpha: April 2017

0.4 — The Money Release
This release will focus on adding:
Economic abstraction
Companies will be able to hold and interact with any standard value-holding token

Improved budgeting and accounting
Organizations will be in itself the organization's bank account.

Dividends
Dividend sharing with shareholders, if desired.

Fundraising tokens
Company will be able to raise funds in the form of tokens, not necessarily ether. More
flexible founding routes.

Funds vault
Final funds vault API, the only part of the company that is not expected to change. This will
make upgradeability easier, being able to redeploy significant parts of the organization while
maintaining its access to the funds.

Release Calendar
• Alpha: June 2017
• Bug bounty (mainnet): From July to September 2017
• Private Beta (mainnet): October 2017
This will be the first release that gets deployed to the mainnet.

0.5 — The Modular Release

Blockchain projects that have already manifested interest

This release will focus on adding:
Organization-wide encrypted datastores
Using a connector for IPFS/Swarm, we will provide a second layer that will give storage
capabilities to the dapp. This way, new features and UX sugar will be able to be added to the
organizations. Example: setting a company’s logo, or implementing an organization-wide
identity system, instead of public ones.

Front-end modules API
This will let developers build modules for Aragon that extend its functionality.

Core modules API
The API will let the developer trigger actions inside the organization itself, and access more
low-level capabilities.

Module developer incentives plan
We will provide a module store and incorporate an incentives system for developers to be
rewarded.

Release Calendar
• Alpha: September 2017
• Private Beta (mainnet): December 2017

0.6 — The Upgradeable Release

This release will focus on adding:
Full upgradeability
Organizations that will be able to run as long as the Ethereum blockchain runs. No matter if
big chunks of functionality are swapped.

Different upgrade tracks
We will provide different upgrade options. This is what we are targeting:

• Automatic upgrades: The network will automatically upgrade the organization.
• Delegated upgrades: A representative appointed by the org will upgrade it.
• Upgrades by voting: A majority of voting power will approve upgrades.

0.9 — The Unknown Release

This is a wildcard release. The ecosystem is evolving very quickly and we don't know what
interesting features we may want to add that will make the 1.0 release more appealing.
Some ideas of what we might work on here:
Privacy-focused companies
zkSnarks could provide companies with way more privacy. Private voting and ownership are
very interesting concepts we are researching about.

Different governance mechanisms
Until now Aragon companies and the Network will be simple liquid democracy based
entities.
We are closely following research and experimentation on other governance mechanisms
such as Futarchy.

Unstoppable organizations

Our vision is to make decentralized
organizations widespread
Our first step was to develop an extremely easy to use product on
top of the Ethereum blockchain that lets everyone run decentralized organizations. Now we have validated the concept, the
market interest and most importantly, the main hurdles to realize
our vision. And we are introducing the Aragon Network to overcome them.

ANT sale starts:

Founding Team

Why the Aragon Network
We have figured out the two main hurdles to make decentralized
organizations widespread: upgradeability and decentralized arbitration. Making organizations upgradeable is key, so they can last
as long as the Ethereum chain is up. Secondly, providing a way to
resolve human disputes that smart contracts donât cover nor
understand is a must.
Our answer to those problems, and many other future problems
that require network scale and cannot be solved in an individual
manner, is the Aragon Network.

What it does
The Aragon Network (AN) will be the first DAO whose goal is to act
as a digital jurisdiction that makes it extremely easy and friendly
for organizations, entrepreneurs and investors to operate.
The Aragon Network will let organizations opt-in to it and use the
services it'll provide. Moreover, it'll provide a built-in governance
system so the organizations using it will decide which services are
provided, their cost, and other parameters.
The first services we want to provide are automatic contract
upgrades and a decentralized court service.

Abstract

The Aragon Network is a token-governed digital jurisdiction that focuses on creating the
best conditions for true global indiscriminatory economic growth. Essentially, the
Aragon Network is an ecosystem where organizations, entrepreneurs, and investors can
eﬃciently and securely transact without risk of technical bugs or malicious parties.

Aragon Network organizations will be built using Aragon Core, a Solidity DAO framework and web-based decentralized app (dApp). Initially, Aragon Core will specialize in
capitalist companies but is modular enough to accommodate other types of organizations.

This paper first discusses the principles of an organization and the functions of Aragon
Core. Next, Aragon Network’s token model and network governance will be explained.
Finally, it defines the two principal services the Aragon Network should implement to
ensure its success; a decentralized court solution and an upgrade mechanism. The decentralized court solution will serve to arbitrate human conflict beyond what can be reasonably written in a smart contract. The upgrade mechanism for Aragon Core organizations
will facilitate useful upgrades needed to drive mainstream adoption by non-technical
users.

1. Introduction
1.1. About Aragon Core
Aragon is a dApp that lets anyone create and manage any kind of organization (companies, open source projects, NGOs, foundations, hedge funds...) on the Ethereum
blockchain.

Aragon implements basic features of an organization like a cap table, token transfers,
voting, role assignments, fundraising, and accounting. The behavior of an Aragon organization is easily customized by changing the bylaws. In addition, Aragon organizations
are extensible through third party modules that interact with the organizations' contracts.

1.2. Current limitations
The properties of the Ethereum blockchain present unique opportunities for the creation
and management of decentralized organizations, including immutability of records,
transparency, and fast transactions. But in order to satisfy multiple requirements that
human beings need in order to transact and create value, a layer on top of it needs to be
created to align the incentives of everyone participating in the system.

When designing Aragon Core, multiple issues were addressed that would deter most
people from creating, running, or interacting with a decentralized organization. These
include:

Some of those issues are:

- Subjective breaches: Smart contracts can encode most of the possible
breaches of contract, but there is always subjectivity in human relationships. A unbiased

Aragon Network

https://aragon.network

arbitration system is needed for cases where conflict is not explicitly resolved in the
smart contract code.
- Software bugs: The error is always between the chair and the keyboard. Code
can contain bugs so the software needs to be easily upgradeable, and a sound bug bounty mechanism must exist to incentivize potential attackers to claim a bounty, rather
than attack.
- Reward systems: Monetization around certain protocols and systems is unclear at this point. Some players will be key to making organization possible, so a simple
reward mechanism is needed.

2. Aragon Core organizations
2.1. Organization specs
An organization has multiple needs, the main ones being:

- Identity: This is the very first pillar since we need to establish each entity's identity
before operating with them.
- Ownership: Shares are a way to reward founders, investors, advisors, partners and
employees and can determine the ownership and direction of the company.
- Voting: The company's shareholders should be able to have a word over its actions.
We will directly link this to ownership.
- Capital: Since a venture can be risky and may need to acquire certain goods in order
to operate or grow, capital in the form of investment/loans is needed.
- People: In the end, it's human beings who build the organizations. Easy ways to onboard them (identity) and reward (payroll) them are needed.
- Outreach: A company needs to target their audience in order for them to buy the
company's product. In the Internet era, having a domain name is enough.
- Payment processor: Organizations need to be paid. There needs to exist a way for
them to capture payments easily.
- Accounting: In order to manage expenses, burn rate and make business decisions,
there is a need to maintain book-keeping.
- Insurance: A company is usually risky and may need to buy insurance in case something unexpected goes wrong.

Some of these create this dependency graph, which ends up being circular:

Aragon Network

7

https://aragon.network

- Identity: No dependencies
- Ownership: Depends on identity since you need to make sure you're interacting with
the right entity
- Voting: Depends on ownership since ownership implies control
- Capital: Depends on voting since implies issuing shares
- People: Depends on capital since you need it to hire people

2.2. Implementation
A. dApp runner
A major advantage of the Ethereum development framework is the multiple ways of
running dApps. When considering the default dApp runner for Aragon, we considered
the pros and cons of multiple options (see figure 2.1.3 A for considerations).

https://aragon.network

Even though Aragon Core currently runs on all the above configurations as a pure
dApp, we have ultimately implemented the native Aragon app with an Electron wrapper
for its intuitive installation and familiar user interface, and injected MetaMask because
it provides the greatest control of the user experience.

We will be pushing it as the default Aragon experience, and we think it will be friendly
for people who have never heard of Ethereum to be introduced to it and be managing an
Aragon Core organization in less than 15 minutes.

Figure 2.1.3 B: Native Aragon app 0.3 alpha release.

B. Identity
When issuing new tokens or paying an employee, the organization needs to know that
the assets are sent to the correct person. To address this requirement, we’re initially inAragon Network

9

https://aragon.network

tegrating Keybase to assign identities to cryptographic entities. We are currently investigating other identity providers to integrate with Aragon, including uPort.
We have published our thinking on managing identity in dApps in the Aragon blog [4].

C. Permissions
Identity drives us to permissions. Example of some permissions could be:

- Shareholder: Has the right to receive dividends, when emitted, and transfer the shares
to another party if it doesn't go above a threshold set by the voting power.
- Executive: Has more permissions, can do some tasks without needing approval by voting.

However, decentralized trustless (or trust-reduced) organizations can allow for much
more flexible relationships of diﬀerent individuals with the organization. Aragon organizations have customizable bylaws that allow for fine-grain customization into who can
perform an action (ie, an executive can add an employee to the payroll) or what needs
to happen (ie, a voting needs to be approved to issue tokens) before the action is allowed.

D. Reputation
Reputation is very valuable in free markets. We want every interaction to be rated if
wanted.
This enables organizations to value the work of a contractor, for example, and the contractor to value the company.
Since we have all the relationship audit trail in place, we can easily trace the interactions in order for the reviews to really be authentic. This will be fully anonymous, if
wanted.

Aragon Network

https://aragon.network

E. Onboarding
When opening the app, you should be able to create an Ethereum account and safely
back it up.
Afterwards, you should either:
- Input the address of the company you want to interact with
- Deploy a new company contract, in which case the dApp will automatically point itself
to the contract's address

The onboarding process should feel familiar to anyone, not only to the cryptocurrencies
enthusiasts. That's why it should be that easy.

F. Ownership
Ownership in an Aragon Core organization is transparent and transferable. Each stakeholder’s holdings are public, and a stakeholder has the right to transfer ownership to another party. There are four transparent functions of ownership built into Aragon Core.
These are:

- List all stakeholders (and their holdings)
- Issue shares, arbitrarily or with parameters
- Sell or transfer tokens
- Issue new tokens
The organization can issue tokens with limited transferability according to a Vesting
Calendar or a diﬀerent criteria.

It is important to note that all tokens issued will be compliant with the ERC20 token [5]
standard. This means that a stakeholders’ addresses can be linked to a name or tag, or
fetched by a secure identity provider.

Aragon Network

11

https://aragon.network

G. Capital
Startup organizations need to be able to quickly raise capital. For a traditional startup,
this would mean riding the VC unicorn rollercoaster, crowdfunding through a third party (e.g. Kickstarter), applying for a business loan, or bothering friends, relatives, and
connections for investments. Aragon Core organizations can easily issue new shares in
exchange for capital without operating with a third party, both through direct sales and
public oﬀerings.

- Aragon Core organizations can issue shares directly to another party when the party sends the negotiated amount of currency.

- If an organization wants raise capital publicly, Aragon Core organizations can publish share oﬀers in the marketplace. Investors can then directly contact to negotiate
or invest in a hard limit number of shares.

H. Rewards
Hiring and paying employees is unnecessarily complicated. Aragon Core simplifies the
process. Aragon Core organizations will be able to put people on their payroll and issue
them tokens under specific parameters, including time and/or task-based performance.

The user interface will let the user choose the amount to pay, the frequency, the shares
to reward, and the parameters. To make the process more eﬃcient, rewards can be in
any Ethereum based token (using decentralized exchanges like the ones powered by the
0x protocol [6]) or any cryptocurrency with solutions like Cosmos or Polkadot that enable inter-blockchain currency exchange.

If fiat is preferred, there will also be an option to generate prefilled credit cards with fiat
from the company's funds. A solution like Shake, which has an API to generate instant
and anonymous VISA cards, can be directly integrated with Aragon Core.
Aragon Network

12

https://aragon.network

I. Payment processor
For incoming payments, clients will be able to buy crypto currencies that then can be
converted to the entrepreneurs' currency choice by using services like ShapeShift.
After the user has acquired the crypto currency, the user will proceed to the payment.
But for them, it will be a single step and everything will be transparently handled in the
background.
We foresee this as being the most common flow in the beginning, instead of users creating their wallets right away.

We will integrate with cryptocurrency exchanges and providers in order to provide a
smooth user experience, similar to Stripe's.

J. Accounting
Accounting is fully built in, and we will eventually provide connections to third party
visualization services, in order not to reinvent the wheel.

2.3 Modular Software
Aragon Core is all of the required pieces to run an organization with the minimum principles for an organization (see previous section for principle definitions) on the Ethereum
network. However, organizations have unique needs that may not be available in the
out-of-the-box Aragon Core software. To address this issue, we’ve built Aragon Core as
a modular system that allows for additional functionality to be developed on top (see
section 2.5 for technical details).

We also envision developers using Aragon Core as the foundation for use cases not related to creating and running an organization. Potential use cases for Aragon Core that
we’ve envisioned include:

Aragon Network

13

https://aragon.network

- Political election voting module - a small prediction marketplace could check if elected
oﬃcials stick to campaign promises and reward those who voted for them

- Contractor payment module - Pay contractors as they work for your project or
achieve milestones

- Accounting module - Accounting module with advanced data visualization (beyond
oﬀered in Aragon Core)

Importantly, all modules can be coded using standard web technologies. This lets the
developer use the tool they like, while keeping strong sandboxing and security in place.

2.4. Aragon Core summary
Aragon Core is where custom logic for organizational behavior lives. In summary, the
main components of the Aragon Core application layer are:

- bylaws that define user permissions, i.e. who can perform an action,
- a governance system to make decisions,
- a capital system for issuing and controlling tokens, and
- an accounting system to manage funds.
Each of these components work together to meet the principles of an eﬃcient and fair
organization in a decentralized way. In addition, the modular nature of the system enables Aragon Core organizations to customize the software to meet their unique needs,
or retrofit Aragon Core to fit another application (like voting for a political election).
Aragon Core will implement a Module System so further functionality could be built on
top.

3. DAO architecture: Kernel, Organs and Applications
The following sections discuss the minimum definition of a Decentralized Autonomous
Organization (DAO) [7], the principles of the DAO adopted by Aragon Core and the
Aragon Network, and the structure and function of the DAO kernel.

3.1. The minimum definition of a DAO
We believe a DAO should be defined at its minimum expression. This is defined as an
organization that only possesses the capability to successfully update itself [8], without
losing its eternal identity.

3.2. Principles of the DAO
Before defining the diﬀerent components this kernel for the DAO has, let’s define what
are the basic principles of the DAO that we want to accomplish.
- She is. We need to recognize the eternal existance of the DAO as an entity that
exists in the world.
• A DAO will exist until herself decides to cease existing. At that point it will
be gone forever.
• A DAO is able to self-update her most basic components and continue being
recognized as the same entity.
- She owns. A DAO has internal capital and therefore owns property, principally
in the form of digital assets (cryptocurrency, tokens, digital property such as domain
names, IP…)
- She acts. She can take action towards the outside world or towards herself. Her
software executes computer code in the form of smart contracts.
- She is governed. Besides its previously programmed actions, outside human
or machine action will be able to trigger certain DAO actions.

Aragon Network

15

https://aragon.network

3.3. Kernel Functions
A core function of the kernel is to act as a registry that defines the organs and their respective priority levels. It’s important to note that each organ has a unique priority level. Thus, if an new organ is set to a priority level that already exists, it will replace the
original organ.

The kernel is also responsible for accepting diﬀerent types of entry point transactions
and
dispatching them to the organs using a standard API. The current entry-points supported by the kernel are:

- Standard transfers, value transfer in ether: Vanilla Ethereum transactions
that may have value attached to them.
- Pre-authorized transfers, value transfer in ether: The kernel supports previously signed calls to the DAO by a certain sender. The sender can pre-sign a certain
transaction payload and provide the signature (r, s, v values) to the party that will execute the transaction on their behalf. This could be another contract or part of the
mechanism to implement state channels.
- Token transactions, we consider tokens to be equally good value holding assets as ether, and we believe that at the application level they should be as powerful as
ether. The kernel will accept token transfers (with data and therefore function execution) for all the standard methods. Implementations for the ERC23 [9] token receiver
interface and the approveAndCall workflow from ConsenSys HumanStandardToken [10]
are ready.

Note that when the value transfer is in ether, the kernel will tokenize the ether in a
standard token. This allows the DAO to interact with any tokenized asset while only implementing the sensitive logic once instead of implementing ether and tokens separately.

Aragon Network

16

https://aragon.network

Finally, the kernel functions as a gatekeeper for new transaction requests. When the
kernel receives a request, it asks the priority 1 organ whether the requested transaction
is allowed by that entity. If allowed, the kernel redirects the transaction to the priority 1
organ (i.e. the dispatch organ). If not allowed, the transaction fails and terminates.

3.4 Kernel Basic Components
A. The dispatch organ – She acts I
The dispatch organ determines if the requested transaction is allowed to be performed
by the requestor. It contains the logic or asks an oracle at an upper level of the stack for
the logic. As discussed in the previous section, the kernel asks for permission before performing any transactions.

If the transaction is not permitted, the transaction fails. If permitted, the dispatch organ
triages the request to the capable organ. It determines the organ to execute the transaction by checking each organ, including itself, in order of priority. The transaction will be
executed by the first organ with the capability to execute the transaction.

B. The meta organs – She is
The meta organ self-upgrades the DAO and controls self-destruction. It is responsible for
updating both the root DAO reference to the kernel and the kernel organ registry.

C. The vault organ – She owns
The vault organ secures the funds and properties that the DAO owns (token assets) and
controls the ability to spend them.

D. The token organ – She is governed
The token organ keeps track of DAO governance tokens. In addition, the token organ
controls the logic for adding, replacing and removing tokens.
Aragon Network

17

https://aragon.network

E. The application organ – She acts II
The application layer for the DAO is an organ itself. Importantly, applications ran by
this organ will have very little access to other organs for kernel and organ security (i.e.
sandboxing).

Here in the application layer is where most of the logic for the organization will live. Different applications (in the form of Ethereum contracts) will be installed providing the
DAO with extra functionality. We will create a module or application 'store' so organizations can easily install re-usable components in their organizations.

4. The Aragon Network
The Aragon Network (AN) will be the first decentralized autonomous organization
whose goal is to act as a digital jurisdiction that makes it extremely easy and friendly
for organizations, entrepreneurs and investors to operate.

The Aragon Network will be bootstrapped with a very thin Constitution voted by its
governance. New laws can be added and they can be amended by the governance of the
AN.

Also a very important role of the core Aragon Network contracts will be to ensure
membership of organizations in the network and check that they are following the stablished rules.

The network will operate by accumulating capital in the form of fees to the operation of
the organizations transacting on the network. This fees will contribute to the network
internal capital, that the network governance will freely allocate. The main destination
of these funds will probably be service providers to the network, that will be necessary
for the network operations.

These main services are:
- Development of the Aragon core contracts that allows running decentralized organizations.
- A decentralized court (Appendix A), with the possibility of freezing organizations.
- A contract upgradeability service for all Aragon Core contracts (Appendix B), with a
built-in bug bounty mechanism.

We can say that the Aragon Network will provide everything an organization needs to
thrive. Looking for a real-world metaphor, the best one would be what Delaware is today for companies, investors and entrepreneurs.

The Aragon Network is the far more eﬃcient digital Delaware that lives in the
blockchain.

5. The Aragon Network Token, ANT
The same way currency represents wealth in a macroeconomic way, ANT represents the
wealth of the decentralized Aragon-enabled economy.

5.1. Network Kickoﬀ and ANT Issuance
To kickstart the network, an uncapped number of ANT will be sold based on a predetermined price function that increases over time. The funds raised from the initial sale
will be transferred to the Aragon Foundation to fund development of Aragon Core and
the Aragon Network (Figure 5.1 B)

Some time after the sale ends, a Community members multisig will deploy the Aragon
Network once they consider it implements its stated mission and it is secure to do so. At
this moment the network will initiate and governance decisions will begin to be made by
ANT token holders. (Figure 5.1 A)

https://aragon.network

Figure 5.1 B: The Aragon Token Sale mechanism

Aragon Network

22

https://aragon.network

5.2. A Continuous Token model
ANT will continue to be minted by the network following the initial sale and network
deployment. Minting new tokens will have a cost, and a percentage of the fees (decided
by governance) paid by organizations to join the network will fund the minting of new
tokens. This creates an incentive for Aragon organizations to pay fees, as organizations
that contribute more will receive more ANT. This means that the organization will be
more influential in network decisions.

The cost to mint new tokens will be determined by ANT token holders. This will likely
be a contentious decision, and one where the basic economic principles of supply and
demand need to be considered. For example, consider the scenario where the cost of
minting tokens is too low. More and more tokens will be added to the supply, until supply greatly outweighs demand. This is a recipe for inflation and the value of individual
ANT tokens will fall. Ultimately, we believe that token holders will eventually decide on
a healthy equilibrium for inflation. By weighing the opinion of every stakeholder, the
market will accurately reflect the optimal minting cost.

5.3 Network Governance
Initially, the Aragon Network will be a liquid democracy [10] (alternatives, such as
futarchy [11], are being considered and we are actively following done in this are) that
makes token issuing, fund allocation, and network rules decisions. See figure 5.3 for more
details about a sample decisions made by ANT token holders.

This means that when the Network is deployed governance decisions will be made by
ANT holders with a system of proposal and votings. This mechanism will allow for creating proposals that result in the mechanism being upgraded.

5.4. Network Adaptability
The Aragon Network will provide a series of basic services that are needed to make decentralized
organizations widespread. However, our intent is that it will remain as global and open
as possible.

While the Aragon Network has some basic constitution and governance methods, everyone will be able to create another network inside the Aragon Network with a more specific set of laws. For example, you could create an organization, join the Aragon Network, and vote for a new set of laws specific to your organization. Eﬀectively, organizations will be able to use the Aragon Network’s services basic constitution and services as
a framework, and build a custom set of rules to govern relationships inside organizations.

5.5. Further uses of the token
The ANT token will be the native token for all of the network services that require a
token, either for governance or other functionalities. For example in the case of the
court, holders will be able to use their tokens to help arbitration and get a rewarded.

5.6 Token technical features
ANT will be ERC20 compatible with some extra features on top such as clone-ability
and Vesting Calendars built-in.

6. Summary
The AN solves the core issues that may arise when running a fully decentralized organization, by providing services that work much better on a large scale and make Aragon
organizations more eﬃcient. It provides a way for the network to pay for its public
goods.

https://aragon.network

Appendix: Network Services
We are defined the two fundamental network services the AN will hire. These may or
may not be developed by Aragon Dev.

The following are not protocol specs but a brief definition of our research on the matter
and the features that the AN would need from them.

Appendix A: Decentralized arbitration system for the Aragon Network
1. Driving factors
When transacting in the market, trust breaches may emerge and cause disputes between
stakeholders.

Thanks to the trustless nature of smart contracts, a lot of that problem surface disappears, since terms can be previously established and no part can trick them afterwards.
But there are terms that are impossible to describe with code, and therefore disputes
will emerge because of them.

Let's think about these two examples:
- An investor invests into an organization and receives some voting power. The
organization founder then goes rogue and sends all investment money to his personal
account. If this was an Aragon organization, the investor just had to make sure that
transactions above a certain threshold have to be approved by a majority voting.
- A founder hires a new sysadmin in a SaaS organization. The employee then has
access to their very valuable user database, and can steal it and use it for his own benefit. The code running on Ethereum doesn't really have any way to know what happened,
therefore Aragon organizations are vulnerable to this human breach of trust.

Aragon Network

26

https://aragon.network

We believe there should be an opt-in system for participants that want to cover themselves against these kinds of human behavior.

The traditional solution to this are government-powered jurisdictions. Since Aragon organizations are location and government-agnostic — they are meant to be run on the
Ethereum network — we came out with a better solution.

2. A decentralized, liquid, forkable jurisdiction
An Aragon Network Jurisdiction (ANJ) defines a set of contracts that:

- Provide arbitration for any given dispute between two parties.
- Allow ANT holders to vote on certain basic rules that the arbitrators will take
in account.

2.1. Entities
Entities (such as organizations or employees) can participate in the network by giving
the entire control of their contracts to the ANJ contract.

Entities that interact between each other, for example an organization and an employee,
will be able to state more details (than the ones already in the contract) of their desired
relationship in any cryptographic way, for example timestamping a common document
than is then signed by both parties.

2.2. ANT functionality in the ANJ
- Voting power for multiple decisions and purposes, such as a set of general basic
rules and replacing judges in the Supreme Court.
- Ability to make bonds in order to open an arbitration.

Aragon Network

27

https://aragon.network

2.3. Judges
Entities that want to be arbitrators can post a bond in order to participate as judges.

3. Arbitration mechanism

In order to open an arbitration, the applicant should post a bond. This bond will be
given back if the case is resolved in their favor, and will be taken if not.

The arbitration petition can also be freezing, which means that it will immediately
freeze the defendant's contracts (eg. in case an attacker is exploiting a bug). Only applicants that are among the defendant's organization shareholders will be allowed for this
petition. (Figure A)

For human verdicts, the decisions of the judges are submitted using a two-step reveal of
their decision for keeping it private for the whole decision making and not allowing the
verdicts of other judges to influence their decision. This scheme is used in the auctions
for Ethereum Name Service domain name registry. It works as follows:

- After deciding on the verdict, the judge will generate a secret random number and
submit the hash and their decision to the court, while keeping the secret private.

- When the period for submitting verdicts is over, judges must reveal what their verdict
was by providing their secret number. Then every one can check the validity of their
verdict. Failure to reveal the secret results in a big penalization of the judge bond.

- For preventing judge collusion, if anyone provides the secret number of a verdict for a
judge (proving that he made it public), the judge will be penalized and a part of the
judge bond will go to the entity that reveal the secret.
3.1. Human judges
When an arbitration is started:
Aragon Network

28

https://aragon.network

- A sample of 5 judges that posted a bond will be chosen randomly from the network. If
one of them refuses to participate it is sightly penalized and another one is chosen.
- These judges look at the ANJ's basic rules, then organization-specific rules (if any) and
then any other materials sent to them encrypted by the parties.
- They post a bet plus a secret.
- When the arbitration is due, they reveal their secrets.
- The bond is given back/rewarded to the judges, plus measures take place to penalize
the losing party.
- The judges that voted the right answer are rewarded with a non-transferable token
called reputation, and the others are extremely penalized.

3.2. Prediction marketplace
If the applicant is not satisfied with the human judges resolution, they can request an
upgrade (by posting a significantly larger bond) to the next level, which is a prediction
marketplace in which all the network judges can participate. For this, we can use
projects like Augur or Gnosis.

When an arbitration is started:

- These judges look at the ANJ basic rules, then organization-specific rules (if
any) and then any other materials posted to the network.
- They post a bet plus a secret.
- When the arbitration is due, they reveal their secrets.
- The bond is given back/rewarded to the judges, plus measures take place to penalize the losing party.
- If the result is diﬀerent that the one voted by the human judges in the previous
step, all judges that voted the incorrect answer are extremely penalized.

Aragon Network

29

https://aragon.network

3.3. Supreme court
If the applicant is not satisfied with the two previous steps, they can request an upgrade
(by posting a significantly larger bond) to the ultimate level, which is a court composed
of the top 9 judges by ANJ payout.

When an arbitration is started:
- These judges look at the ANJ basic rules, then organization-specific rules (if
any) and then any other materials posted to the network.
- They post a bet plus a secret.
- When the arbitration is due, they reveal their secrets.
- The bond is given back/rewarded to the network, plus measures take place to
penalize the losing party.
- If the result is diﬀerent that the one voted by the human judges in the previous
step, all judges that voted the incorrect answer are extremely penalized.

These judges are paid a salary determined by the AN token holders and paid by the
ANF. (Figure B)

3.4. Incentives design
Looking at the way the system is designed, one can argue that judges and the whole
network if asked will be economically incentivized to dismiss the applicants request for
arbitration and take her bond money to be split among them.

This makes the applicant know that chances are, if her case is not clear enough it will be
dismissed. But the judges also know, that if they lie and dismiss cases just for their personal gain and the case is unanimously over ruled, their tokens/bonds will be burnt.

Aragon Network

30

https://aragon.network

The system is designed to incentivize as less arbitration as possible and more as a safeguard for honest parties in case they are taken advantage of.

4. Summary
An ANJ provides the tools needed to solve all the subjectability humans relationships
bring to the table.

It sets the incentives right for Aragon organizations to be a part of it, since:

- Parties that want to interact with the given organization will want certain guarantees in case there's a breach of trust not covered by the contracts.
- Some bugs could be stopped by opening an arbitration that could freeze all activity
until the case is resolved.

ANJ's voting processes are fully liquid, but in any case between some stakeholders and
the rest, it could potentially be forked. This creates incentives for their governance model to work. However, we believe an ANJ creates notable network eﬀects because:

- Interacting with other party will likely require them to be signed up too, since
otherwise it opens a surface for breaches of trust.
- If it's extended, then all parties (including investors) are familiar with its basic
rules.

Appendix B: Aragon Network smart contract security and upgradeability strategy
The great thing and at the same time problem with smart contracts is that once you
create them, they will exist in the blockchain and execute whatever code the developer
wrote, which not always reproduces the exact intention of the creator of the contract.

The most important example of this is The DAO hack, where an unexpected combination of actions, resulted in the contract sending tons of its money to the hacker. In this
case, a Hard Fork was done at the protocol level to prevent the leak of funds.

At Aragon we are creating the software needed to create and run DAOs, but in a scalable and easy way so people that have never heard of Ethereum can run their organizations using it.
We need to build a system where people unfamiliar with the matter will be able to run
their organizations with the certainty that they will always be running the latest version
of the software and that they are as secure as possible from attacks.

This service will be available to all the participant organizations in the Aragon Network,
but organizations can decide to what degree they rely on it, from total upgrade control
(no code is modified in my organization if I don't approve it) to no control at all (keep
me safe, I don't want to know anything), to a middle ground (don't normally upgrade
me, but if there is a severe security threat do it automatically).

This is still a work in progress, but it is an important addition to the network if we want
to see thousands of secure DAOs emerge.

Aragon Network

33

https://aragon.network

1. Components

Described below are diﬀerent components we currently have planned for ensuring the
integrity of the network and individual organizations.

1.1. Proxy libraries for upgradeable smart contracts

The current way of deploying (serious) smart contract systems usually relies on performing a sound security audit of the contract, uploading it to the network and hope for the
best. Since code is immutable law by default, it's not possible to roll out upgrades that
may fix bugs or better map the programmer's original intention.

Or maybe it is not a fault of the programmer of the smart contract, the consensus algorithm of the protocol is changed and the contract becomes vulnerable to a new attack
vector.

This is a problem when a system is not upgradeable and we think that the contract that
was written today will be good forever. This might be true for simple systems, but not
for DAOs or Networks as complex as Aragon.

We have been doing research to solve this problem for months and our current solution
is to try to encapsulate as much as the system business logic in Solidity libraries. Doing
Library Driven Development [J. Izquierdo, 2017] and then instead of linking this business logic forever in the contract, having Proxy Dispatcher [M. Araoz, 2017] contracts
that will know what version of the library each organization is linked with. We are working with the best smart contract security firm Zeppelin to create this system of proxies
that dispatches to the upgraded versions of libraries and we recently published about it.

Aragon Network

34

https://aragon.network

These techniques will allow for very thin organization contracts that just have storage
and then redirect all the logic to these libraries that all organization uses.

In the case of a bug is found, the new version of the library is deployed and every organization in the network is upgraded depending on their settings:

- Automatic upgrade.
- Notification to upgrade, but requires approval.
- Nothing at all, organization decides not to use upgradeability and handle it
themselves.

1.2. Network wide bug bounties
The side eﬀect of having the same contract run by multiple organizations is that it becomes a target for hacking. On a more positive note, there are also stakeholders incentivized to allocate resources to ensure this hacking doesn't happen.

The network will create a bug bounty program for all the contracts organizations rely on
and the network contracts. History shows that when people are economically incentivized to do good, most people finding a bug will report it to the program and get the
bounty, rather than looking for ways to harm more people.

We are experiencing with the idea of making the bug bounty pretty automatic, by having a test suite for organization contracts on chain, and if someone is capable of breaking the tests, automatically pay them out depending on the severity.

The upgradeabilty mechanism of the network fits very well with the bug bounty program, because the moment a vulnerability is found, the time that passes until it is
solved for everyone in the upgrade track is minimized.

Aragon Network

35

https://aragon.network

1.3. Global safe stop
In case a severe bug or attack is detected, the Aragon Network will be able to stop all
organization contracts (every organization that opted in for this) and perform an investigation and code upgrade before restoring the service.

We will be developing a bot that will look at all public transactions coming to Aragon
organizations and in case it detects weird behavior or unexpected state that might be a
threat, it will page in someone from the Aragon Project. In case the bot determines the
threat is big enough and action must be immediate, it could stop all organizations while
the person in charge looks at the situation.

This means that in less than 30 seconds an attack could be stopped for all organizations,
and fixed immediately with the upgrade mechanism. In case of a false positive, the person paged in would restart activity for every one and the downtime shouldn't be greater
than 10 minutes.

1.4. ANJ action against bad actors in an organization
As defined in the Aragon Network Jurisdiction document, all organizations in the network agree to be bound to the ANJ decentralized court. This protects individual organization stakeholders from the pure objectivity of smart contracts, that makes it very difficult and unproductive to encode certain things.

Once a case is created, the court will be able to change or undo actions in the organization contract. This is only a protective measure for stakeholders. By placing a big
enough bond, a shareholder of an organization can submit a case to the ANJ and as a
preventive measure freeze the organization. If the court decides the case
wasn't legit, this person would lose their bond to the court (and part to the organization).
Aragon Network

2. Tradeoﬀs
As with most good things in life, security comes with tradeoﬀs.
We can imagine a triangle very similar to Zooko's Triangle (Figure A) applied to building decentralized apps, with Security, Decentralization and Ease of Use at its edges. Prioritizing a lot on one, will certainly come at the expense of the other too.

Figure A: Zooko's Triangle

We find all three very important, but it is very diﬃcult to have a perfect system on the
three fronts. Our vision with this is to create a system where every user or organization
can choose what compromises they are comfortable making.

A. Security
By security we mean the capacity to solve to bugs or threats in a timely manner.
B. Decentralization
The problem with the upgrade mechanism is that at the end a trusted party is the one
in charge of performing the software upgrades, which is a very centralizing factor. The
Aragon Network

37

https://aragon.network

Network may choose to add a voting scheme, in order for the upgrades to roll out only if
they have been correctly peer reviewed.
That's why our upgrading mechanism is opt-in, there will be people who will decide not
to have so much security and be the ones that accept a software update for their organization.

C. Ease of use
The case in which you optimize security and decentralization, it certainly undermines
ease of use as someone needs to understand the code of Aragon to upgrade the organization, which is a huge barrier.

3. Summary
With the methods outlined in this document, the Aragon Network can ensure:
- Future bug fixes and enhancements can be added to the contracts.
- Critical vulnerabilities' impact can be minimized thanks to the bug bounty program,
the global safe stop and the ANJ actions.

Augur: a Decentralized, Open-Source Platform for Prediction Markets
Dr. Jack Peterson & Joseph Krug
www.augur.net
Augur is a trustless, decentralized platform for prediction markets. It is an extension of Bitcoin
Core’s source code which preserves as much of Bitcoin’s proven code and security as possible. Each
feature required for prediction markets is constructed from Bitcoin’s input/output-style transactions.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A prediction market is a place where individuals can
wager on the outcomes of future events. Those who forecast the outcome correctly win money, and if they forecast incorrectly, they lose money. People value money, so
they are incentivized to forecast such outcomes as accurately as they can. Thus, the price of a prediction market
can serve as an excellent indicator of how likely an event
is to occur [1, 2]. Augur is a decentralized platform for
prediction markets.
Our goal here is to provide a blueprint of a decentralized prediction market using Bitcoin’s input/output-style
transactions. Many theoretical details of this project,
such as its game-theoretic underpinning, are touched on
lightly or not at all. This work builds on (and is intended
to be read as a companion to) the theoretical foundation
established in [3].1

A.

Why decentralize?

Historically, the actions required of a prediction market
– accepting wagers, deciding on the outcome of an event,
then paying the wagers back out according to the results
– have been centralized. The simplest approach to aggregating wagers is to have a trustworthy entity maintain a
ledger. The simplest way to determine the outcome of an
event is to get the answer from a wise, impartial judge,
whom all participants in the market trust.
Upon closer inspection, these straightforward answers
fray at the edges: who is this ‘someone’ who is trustworthy enough to maintain a ledger for everyone else? Who
is the judge that every participant trusts? And, even if
such paragons were found and agreed upon, how could
participants be certain they will remain trustworthy once
they are granted more power? “Opportunity makes the
thief”, after all. And, of course, “Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.” [4]
In practice, a larger issue is that these trusted entities
represent single points of failure. Prediction markets are
often disliked by powerful interests. As the experience
of centralized prediction markets – such as InTrade and

1

Additional details and discussions on the theory behind Augur
can be found at www.truthcoin.info.

TradeSports – over the past decade has shown, if governments or special interest groups want to shut down a website, they will find a way: InTrade, after all, was an Irish
company, shut down as a result of the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commissions actions [5, 6]. Even the
Defense Advanced Research Project Agency and Central
Intelligence Agency were forced to end their foray into
prediction markets as a result of Congressional interference [7].
Contrast this with the history of Bitcoin [8]. Bitcoin
is a cryptographic currency and payment platform that
has found an enemy in powerful nation-states and financial institutions. Nevertheless, Bitcoin has thrived: as
of November 2014, it has a market capitalization of over
five billion U.S. dollars, and it is the anchor of a thriving
ecosystem of startups, trade, and technological innovation. This is possible because Bitcoin is decentralized:
once it was released, it could not be shut down. Even its
pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, cannot stop
the cryptocurrency. This is by design: he (or she or they)
purposely did not make himself Bitcoin’s single point of
failure.
Augur is a decentralized prediction market platform.
The Augur Project’s goal is to revolutionize prediction
markets, and, in doing so, change the way that people
receive and verify ‘truth’.
B.

Strategy

Augur is built as an extension to the source code of
Bitcoin Core.2 It includes the features – the betting
and consensus mechanisms – required by prediction markets. However, it is intentionally the same as Bitcoin in
all other respects, to capitalize on Bitcoin’s security and
scalability. Our intention is to use the ‘pegged sidechain’
mechanism to make Augur fully interoperable with Bitcoin [9]; if this technology is not available, we will instead
use our own internal currency as the store of value.
C.

Tokens

Augur has three types of tokens or units. To keep track
of these units, every transaction input and output value

Alternatives, such as smart contract-based implementations, are
discussed in Appendix B.

fields is accompanied by a units field.
Although there are three types of tokens, users have a
single cryptographic private key.3 Augur addresses are
simply base-58 hashes of their cryptographic public keys,
to which users can send tokens. The different types of
token are distinguished from one another solely through
the ‘units’ field. Therefore, users sign the transaction
data of a Reputation payment in exactly the same way
as they would sign a Bitcoin payment.
The first token is Bitcoin. Sidechains allow us to
transfer Bitcoin by creating a transaction on the Bitcoin
blockchain that locks up the Bitcoin in an address [9].
Then a transaction is made on our blockchain with an
input that has a cryptographic proof that the lock was
made on the Bitcoin blockchain along with the genesis
blockhash of its originating blockchain. A simplified payment verification (SPV) scheme is used to verify these
locks. A SPV has a list of block headers for proof-of-work
and cryptographic proof that the locking transaction was
created on one of the blocks in the header list.
A key feature of Augur is tradeable Reputation. The
total amount of Reputation is a fixed quantity, determined upon the launch of Augur. Holding Reputation

Augur uses the same public/private key cryptography system as
Bitcoin: private keys are random 256-bit numbers, with a valid
range governed by the secp256k1 ECDSA standard.

entitles its owner to report on the outcomes of events,
after the events occur. Reputation tokens are similar in
other respects to Bitcoins: they are divisible to eight decimal places, they are accounted for by summing over unspent transaction outputs, and they can be sent between
users.
A significant way that Reputation differs from Bitcoin
is that Reputation is not intended to be a stable source of
value: Reputation tokens are gained and lost depending
on how reliably their owner votes with the consensus.
Reputation holders are obligated to cast a vote every
time the network ‘checks in’ with reality (by default, this
is every 8 weeks). Another significant difference is that
Reputation is not mined. Instead, Reputation will be
distributed by means of an auction, as proposed in [3].
This solves two problems. First, it will provide funding to complete the development of the Augur network.
Second, it bootstraps the network with an initial group
of Reputation-holders who are invested in the network’s
success.
Using a Bitcoin sidechain is a straightforward way to
purchase shares. Users will simply transfer Bitcoins to
the Augur network and use them to buy shares of a
prediction. However, this poses a problem. If two people want to make a wager on whether event X will occur within a year from now, they would be exposed to
the price volatility of Bitcoin. A potential solution is
a seigniorage modeled coin. This would create a new

cryptocurrency, say ‘USDCoin’, and put them on a few
exchanges to be traded. If the price were above one dollar, the coin algorithm would print more coins; if below
a dollar, the algorithm would discontinue printing. This
allows the price of the coin to stay relatively close to a
dollar.4
Another pertinent question is how to distribute the
coins used to buy shares of predictions. A few options
are available: 1) having a Bitcoin sidechain be the mechanism to buy shares, 2) using a seigniorage model to create
a ‘Cashcoin’ or ‘USDcoin’ that maintains its value with
respect to the US Dollar, and 3) using a hybrid approach
of 1 and 2.
In our view, the best option is to sidechain Augur to
Bitcoin, and have a new seigniorage based coin to allow users to both wager with Bitcoin, and another currency which would be used more for longer term wagers in
which volatility would become an issue. This provides the
benefits of allowing interoperability with Bitcoin holders
as well as a currency suited for holding shares of predictions.
II.

PREDICTION MARKET CREATION

The life of a prediction market can be separated into
two principal ‘phases’ (Fig. 1): before and after the event.
To walk through the life cycle of a typical prediction market, consider a user, Joe, who wants to wager on the
outcome of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election.
A.

Event Creation

Joe turns on his Augur program, which plugs him directly into the peer-to-peer network, and clicks on the
‘politics’ group. This brings up a list of all active political prediction markets, along with their current prices.
No one has created a market for the 2016 election yet, so
Joe decides to take the initiative. He clicks on ‘Create
Event’. Here, he enters the necessary information about
this event (Fig. 2):

• Maturation: duration of the forecasting phase.
This is the period where users buy and sell shares
of the market. In Augur, time is marked by the
block interval, which is expected to be constant, on
average. Users have the option of entering a ‘block
number’ (which is exact, but not intuitive) or an
‘approximate end time’ (which is not quite exact,
since the block interval is not always exactly the
same length, but is much more intuitive).
• Creator’s address: the address of the event’s creator.

CreateEvent Transaction

Joe pays a fee of 0.01 Bitcoin to create this event. As
shown in Fig. 2, this is the CreateEvent transaction’s
only input. The CreateEvent transaction also has a single
output, which contains the event’s data.
The output’s data includes the event’s automatically
assigned unique ID, which is a 160-bit hash5 of the other
event output fields. To prevent accidental duplicate event
creation (due to network latency), the same user is not
permitted to create the same event again, with the same
expiration date and description. The value of this output
is the user’s event creation fee. The output can then be
spent by including the event in a CreateMarket transaction (see below).
These inputs and outputs are combined into a Bitcoinstyle transaction:6
{
" type " : " CreateEvent " ,
" vin " : [
{
"n": 0,
" value " : 0 . 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ,
" units " : " bitcoin " ,
" scriptSig " : " < Joe ’ s signature >
<Joe ’ s public key >"
}
],
" vout " : [
{

• Description: a short description of the event.
• Type: binary (yes or no), scalar (numeric), or categorical
• Range of valid answers: yes/no/maybe for boolean,
the minimum and maximum allowed values for
scalar.
• Topic: the category the event falls into. Topics are
created by users, and can be as fine-grained as users
want them to be – examples might be ‘politics’, ‘science’, ‘funny cat videos’, ‘serious cat videos’, and
so on.

See Nubits for an example.

SHA256 followed by RIPEMD160, usually referred to simply as
‘hash-160’.
Like Bitcoin, Augur’s transactions are broadcast and stored in
serialized form. A deserialized, rawtransaction-like JSON format
is shown here for readability. For brevity, fields such as locktime
and sequence are omitted from our examples when they are not
directly relevant. Also, for Script fields (such as scriptSig and
scriptPubKey) only the asm subfield – i.e., the input to CScript()
– is shown.

FIG. 2. CreateEvent transactions are payments from the user’s address to a newly-generated event address. A CreateMarket
transaction is a coinbase for shares of all the events contained in the market. Any user who has created one or more Events
can incorporate their event(s) into a new market. In this simplified diagram, arrows represent inputs and outputs, and lines
represent spending an unspent output. Note that events and markets have been given simplified IDs (E1 , E2 , etc.) here to
make the figure easier to read; actual event and market IDs are 160-bit hashes of the event or market data fields, respectively.

OP_EQUALVERIFY
OP_MARKETCHECK "
}
]

< event hash >
OP_EQUALVERIFY
OP_MARKETCHECK

Since the event ID is the hash-160 of the Event’s data,
the CreateMarket transaction’s matching input Script is:
< market hash >
< market data >
< event data >

The raw event data is supplied by the user to be included
in a market, then is pushed onto the stack during the subsequent CreateMarket transaction. OP MARKETCHECK first
calculates the hash-160 of the market’s fields (excluding
the market ID), then verifies that this hash matches the
actual market ID. The CreateEvent transaction’s output
is automatically sent to the event’s address, which is a
base-58 string derived from the event ID in the same
way that Bitcoin addresses are derived from the public
key’s hash-160.

}

The CreateEvent output’s Script is keyed to the
Event’s ID:7
OP_DUP
OP_HASH 1 6 0

7

Transaction Scripts are conventionally written left-to-right.
However, we use a top-to-bottom format here for the sake of
readability.

B.

Market Creation

Once the event is created, he then clicks on ‘Create
Prediction Market’, where he can include his new Event
in a prediction market. Here he enters other information
about the market:
• Title: label/brief description of the market.
• Events: list event IDs to be included in the market.

5
• Funding: up-front funding provided by the market’s creator, which covers the creator’s maximum
possible loss in this Market. This is calculated using the loss limit, a parameter specified by the user.

"n": 0,
" value " : 2 7 . 7 2 5 8 8 7 2 2 ,
" units " : " bitcoin " ,
" script " : " OP_DUP
OP_HASH 1 6 0
OP_EVENTLOOKUP
OP_ISSHARES
OP_MARKETCHECK "

• Loss limit: this parameter is set by the market’s
creator. The loss limit (`) sets the maximum
amount of money the market’s creator can lose if
the number of shares goes to zero:
maximum possible loss = ` × log Nout

},
{
"n": 1,

" branch " : " politics " ,
" script " : " OP_DUP
OP_HASH 1 6 0
OP_EVENTLOOKUP
OP_ISBITCOIN
OP_MARKETCHECK "

(1)

Nout refers to the number of outcomes, across all
events, in this market. Greater values of ` translate
to greater market liquidity, but greater potential
loss for the market’s creator.
• Creator: the address of the market’s creator.

{

OP_MARKETCHECK "

As shown in Fig. 2, the CreateMarket transaction has
an input and an output for each event included in the
market, plus one additional input and output for the
user’s Bitcoin payment, which provides the market’s initial liquidity. If NE is the number of events included
in the market, then the CreateMarket transaction has
NE + 1 outputs:

},
...

1. The market’s input funding is sent to a special market pool address, which is a hash of the market’s
data fields.
2. There is a coinbase output for each event that is
included in the market. These coinbase outputs
create an essentially unlimited number of shares for
each event.8 Including an event in a market spends
the event transaction’s fee output, so that it is no
longer available to be included in other markets.
This is stored in a transaction as follows:
{
" type " : " CreateMarket " ,
" loss_limit " : 1 . 2 ,
" vin " : [
{
"n": 0,
" value " : 2 7 . 7 2 5 8 8 7 2 2 ,
" units " : " bitcoin " ,
" tradingFee " : 0 . 0 0 5 ,
" scriptSig " : " < Joe ’ s signature >
<Joe ’ s public key >"
}
],
" vout " : [
{

8

Our initial implementation will include 109 shares per event; this
can be increased later if needed.

],
" id " : " < market hash >" ,
" creator " : " < Joe ’ s address >"
}

The tradingFee field is the transaction fee to buy or sell
shares in the market. This is specified by the market’s
creator, and is expressed as a multiple of transaction volume. Here, Joe has set tradingFee at 0.01, so traders in
this market will pay a 1% fee. These fee payments are
divided in half, and split into two Buy and Sell transaction outputs each: one sent to the market’s creator, and
one sent to the market pool.
The locking Scripts for the CreateMarket outputs are
somewhat different than those used by Bitcoin:
OP_DUP
OP_HASH 1 6 0
OP_EVENTLOOKUP
OP_ISBITCOIN ( or OP_ISSHARES )
OP_MARKETCHECK

The purpose of Bitcoin locking Scripts is to verify that
the recipient controls the private key associated with the
public key hash recorded in the Script – that is, that they
are the legitimate owner of the unspent output. By contrast, to spend shares (or Bitcoins) from the CreateMarket outputs, the requirement is that the sender supply (1)
the event ID (hash) of which they are Buying or Selling
shares, and (2) the number of shares or Bitcoins which
they wish to trade.

6
OP EVENTLOOKUP ensures that the target event ID
matches one of the events in the market. OP ISBITCOIN
verifies that the units field in the unlocking input Script
is bitcoin; this instruction is in the Script for the shares
outputs. Similarly, OP ISSHARES verifies that the incoming units field is shares, and is in the equivalent Script
for the market pool (Bitcoin) output.
Happy with the market, Joe then publishes it. This
deducts the ` log NE market funding payment from his
account, and broadcasts his CreateMarket transaction to
the Augur network. Miners can then pick up and include
this transaction in a block like any other transaction.
Once it is incorporated into a block, and attached to the
blockchain, Joe’s Market becomes visible to all users of
the Augur network.

III.

BEFORE THE EVENT: FORECASTING

Joe’s prediction market has now been created. When
the market is first created, the events contained in it
have not yet occurred. This is the forecasting phase. It
lasts from the time the market is created until the expiration specified by each event. Typically, event expiration
should coincide with the occurrence of the event: Joe’s
event is set to expire at midnight on November 5, 2016
(recorded as a Unix timestamp, 1478329200).
In this phase, the market’s participants are forecasting
or predicting the outcome of the event by making wagers. The way that they make these wagers is by buying
and selling the outcome’s shares. In this section, we first
discuss market making, then delve into the details of the
Buy and Sell transactions.

A.

Market Maker

Real-world prediction markets have often had problems with liquidity [10]. Liquidity is an issue for prediction markets, because, generally, a market’s forecasts
are more accurate the more liquid the market is [11].
To avoid the liquidity issues that arise from simple order
books, we instead use the logarithmic market scoring rule
(LMSR) [12, 13].
The LMSR is the market maker for the entire market: all buy and sell orders are routed through the
LMSR, rather than matching buy and sell orders between
traders. The key feature of the LMSR is a cost function
(C, in units of Bitcoin, or BTC), which varies according to the number of shares purchased for each possible
outcome:


N
X
C (q1 , q2 , . . . , qN ) = ` log 
eqj /`  ,
(2)
j=1

where qj denotes the number of shares for outcome j, N
is the total number of possible outcomes, and ` is the

loss limit, which is determined by the market’s creator.
When the qj ’s are all zero,
N
X

e0 = N =⇒ C(0, 0, . . . , 0) = ` log N.

(3)

j=1

This is the maximum possible loss.
The amounts paid by traders who buy and sell shares
in the market are the changes in the cost function caused
by increasing or decreasing the total number of shares.
The cost to the user to buy x shares of outcome k is
the difference between the cost of the new set of shares
outstanding and the old:
C (q1 , q2 , . . . , qk + x, . . . , qN ) − C (q1 , q2 , . . . , qk , . . . , qN )
If a user wants to sell x shares of outcome k, the cost to
the user is the difference:
C (q1 , q2 , . . . , qk − x, . . . , qN ) − C (q1 , q2 , . . . , qk , . . . , qN )
Since this difference is negative, the user receives Bitcoin
from this transaction, in return for shares. The current
price for outcome i (p (qi )) is the derivative of Eq. 2:
eqi /`
p (qi ) = PN
.
qj /`
j=1 e

(4)

A more in-depth discussion of the LMSR, and the equivalence of prices and probabilities, is in Appendix C.
Special Cases

Eq. 2 covers events that can have arbitrary, categorical
outcomes. Our other two event types are special cases of
Eq. 2. Binary events are simply categorical events with
only two possible outcomes. For binary events, the cost
function simplifies to:


Cbinary (q1 , q2 ) = ` log eq1 /` + eq2 /` ,
(5)
If we restrict our attention to events with scalar outcomes, the exponential sum in Eq. 2 becomes an integral:
!
Z
b

eq(x)/` dx ,

Cscalar (q(x)) = ` log

(6)

a

where a and b are the lower and upper bounds on the
scalar’s value. Although the integral in Eq. 6 cannot be
evaluated analytically for unknown q(x), good model extraction and numerical approximation methods exist [14–
17].
B.

Buy and Sell Transactions

Now that Joe’s new market is active, anyone can buy
shares of it using Bitcoin. Another user, Paul, looks up

FIG. 3. Example of a Buy transaction. Here, Paul buys shares in the ‘Yes’ outcome of the Event ‘Hillary Clinton wins the

event E2 .

the current price, which is 2 shares/Bitcoin, and creates a
Buy transaction, trading 5 Bitcoin for 10 shares of Joe’s
event.
A Buy transaction is initiated by a Bitcoin owner. It
has two inputs and two outputs, as shown in Fig. 3. A
Buy transaction sends Bitcoin from the user’s address to
a specified event address, and shares of the event to the
user’s address. It contains the following information:

{
"n": 0,
" value " : 5 ,
" units " : " bitcoin " ,
" script " : " OP_DUP
OP_HASH 1 6 0
< event ID >
OP_EQUALVERIFY
OP_MARKETCHECK "
},
{

• Event: the event for which the user is buying
shares.

"n" : 1,
" value " : 1 0 ,
" units " : " shares " ,
" outcome " : true ,
" script " : " OP_DUP
OP_HASH 1 6 0
< Paul ’ s hash - 1 6 0 >
OP_EQUALVERIFY
OP_CHECKSIG "

• Outcome: the outcome of the event that the user
is buying shares of.
• Amount: the number of shares to buy.
• Price: the price per share, calculated using the
LMSR.
}

This is organized into a transaction as follows:

]
}

{
" type " : " Buy " ,
" vin " : [
{
"n": 0,
" value " : 5 ,
" units " : " bitcoin " ,
" scriptSig " : " < Paul ’ s signature >
< Paul ’ s public key >"
},
{
"n": 1,
" value " : 1 0 ,
" units " : " shares " ,
" outcome " : true ,
" scriptSig " : " < event ID >"
}
],
" vout " : [

Similarly, a Sell transaction sends unspent shares from
the user back to the event, and Bitcoin from the event to
the user:
{
" type " : " Sell " ,
" vin " : [
{
"n": 0,
" value " : 1 0 ,
" units " : " shares " ,
" outcome " : true ,
" scriptSig " : " < Paul ’ s signature >
< Paul ’ s public key >"
},
{
"n": 1,
" value " : 5 ,

8
" units " : " bitcoin " ,
" scriptSig " : " < market ID >
< market data >
< event data >"
}
],
" vout " : [
{
"n": 0,
" value " : 5 ,
" units " : " shares " ,
" outcome " : true ,
" script " : " OP_DUP
OP_HASH 1 6 0
< event ID >
OP_EQUALVERIFY
OP_MARKETCHECK "
},
{
"n" : 1,
" value " : 1 0 ,
" units " : " bitcoin " ,
" script " : " OP_DUP
OP_HASH 1 6 0
< Paul ’ s hash - 1 6 0 >
OP_EQUALVERIFY
OP_CHECKSIG "
}
]

• Reputation: the sender’s Reputation.
To prevent collusion, the contents of Augur reports
must be kept secret. To achieve this, after the user inputs
his/her observations, the Report is encrypted by his/her
local Augur software. After it is encrypted, the Report
transaction is broadcast to the network.

1.

Report data is stored as follows:
{
" type " : " Report " ,
" vin " : [
{
"n": 0,
" value " : 4 0 ,
" units " : " reputation " ,
" scriptSig " : " < Jane ’ s signature >
< Jane ’ s public key >"
},
{
"n": 1,
" value " : 2 ,
" units " : " reputation " ,
" scriptSig " : " < Jane ’ s signature >
< Jane ’ s public key >"
}
],
" vout " : [
{
"n": 0,
" value " : 4 2 ,
" units " : " reputation " ,
" report " : {
" id " : " < report hash >" ,
" outcomes " : " < encrypted >" ,
" quorum " : {
" matured " : true ,
" reported " : 1 ,
" required " : 2 ,
" met " : false
}
},
" script " : " OP_DUP
OP_HASH 1 6 0
< Jane ’ s hash - 1 6 0 >
OP_EQUALVERIFY
OP_CHECKDATA
OP_CONSENSUS
OP_PCACHECK
OP_EQUALVERIFY "
}
]

}

Buy and Sell transactions are atomic, in the sense that
either the entire transaction succeeds, or the entire transaction fails. That is, it is impossible for Paul to send
Bitcoin to the event address, and not receive shares in
return. In traditional database terms, either the entire
transaction is committed – broadcast to the network, included in a block, added to the blockchain – or it is rolled
back. There is no way for only some of the information
in the transaction to be written to the blockchain.

IV.

AFTER THE EVENT: REPORTING

The reporting phase occurs after the event takes
place.9 In this phase, the event’s outcome is easily determinable – to continue with our example of the U.S.
Presidential Election, by Googling for the results of the
Presidential election, after the election has finished.

A.

Reporting

A Report transaction consists of:
• Outcomes: encrypted report that contains the
sender’s observations.

9

Technically, reporting is allowed any time after the Market is
created. However, reporting on an outcome prior to the event’s
occurrence would be a spectacularly unnecessary gamble!

Report Transaction

}

The Report ID is the hash-160 of the Report’s data fields.
Since Reputation is tradeable, it can be sent between
users; here, the user (Jane) has two Reputation inputs
into her Report transaction. One of them comes from
her last Report’s Redemption transaction (see below).
The other, smaller, Reputation input is Reputation that
was sent to her by a friend.

YES
INVALID

Hillary Clinton sucks!

Submit Report

FIG. 4. Sample Report. Reputation owners report on the actual outcome of an event, after the event has occurred. Each
‘Your Report’ entry is initially set to NO REPORT ENTERED; if submitted that way, the user will not receive credit for reporting
on that event. INVALID reports are permitted – in fact, encouraged! – for poorly-worded and/or indeterminate questions, since
truth-by-consensus works well only for outcomes which are easily and objectively determinable. Since this user’s Reputation
is 42, his/her ballot has a weight of 42. Another user who has a Reputation of 105 would also only cast a single ballot, but
his/her opinions would be given 2.5 times as much weight as the first user’s.

There are a few unusual things about the Report transaction. The first is the structured quorum field:
" quorum " : {
" matured " : true ,
" reported " : 0 ,
" required " : 2 ,
" met " : false
}

has users as rows and events as columns; the values of
the matrix are the users’ observations.
The other unusual feature of the Report transaction is
its output Script, which includes several new commands:
OP_DUP
OP_HASH 1 6 0
< Jane ’ s hash - 1 6 0 >
OP_EQUALVERIFY
OP_DATACHECK
OP_CONSENSUS
OP_PCACHECK
OP_EQUALVERIFY

There are two requirements for quorum to be met:
1. The events being reported on must have passed
their maturity time. Typically, if people are reporting on an event, this will be the case – events’
maturity times should be set at or after the (expected) time of occurrence. In this example, the
Report transaction has been made after the maturity time, as expected.
2. The minimum number of required reports must be
met. In this simple example, there are only two reports required to meet quorum, zero of which have
been provided so far.10
Once quorum is met, the market closes, and no more
Bitcoin transactions are accepted. Report broadcasting
continues for a pre-specified period of time. Upon completion of this phase, each Report is decrypted, and the
Reports are gathered into a report matrix. This matrix

10

Not counting the current report, which has just been broadcast
to the network, and is not yet included in a block.

The first, OP DATACHECK, calculates the hash-160 of the
Report’s fields (excluding the report ID), then verifies
that this hash matches the actual Report ID. This is
to ensure that the transaction’s contents were not tampered with during the delay from the time the Report
was broadcast until the market closes.
The second new command, OP CONSENSUS, initiates the
consensus algorithm, which is described in detail in the
following section. OP CONSENSUS requires the report matrix as an input. The report matrix does not yet exist
when the reports are first broadcast; instead, it is pieced
together when the Reports are decrypted. Once the report matrix is assembled, it is written to the associated
input’s scriptSig.
OP PCACHECK verifies that the outcome of the consensus algorithm is correct.11
The final opcode,

11

The consensus algorithm is a modified form of a common statistical technique called PCA (Principal Component Analysis) [18],

associated with the events listed on the ballot remain open. Later, Jane fills out her ballot and broadcasts it. At this point
2/2 users have reported, and quorum is reached. This automatically triggers the Redemption transaction, which makes use of
special commands in the Report transactions’ output Scripts to reach and verify consensus. Notice there are actually 3 users
total; the third user, Beatrice, neglected to submit a Report, and therefore lost Reputation.

The Redemption transaction is quite large: it has two
inputs for every outstanding wager – one for Bitcoin, one
for shares.12 Reputation balances are updated using a
modified version of the Sztorc consensus algorithm [3].13
This algorithm’s purpose is to reward users whose reports are consistent with the consensus, and punish those
whose reports are not.
Per-share values are fixed according to the consensusdetermined outcomes. The fixed share-price values are
then used to determine the payout sent to all users holding shares in these events. Payout values are assembled
in a matrix containing the events in columns, and the

where R has the elements of r on its diagonal and zeros

Each row (and column) of Σ corresponds to the variability across users, within a single event. Since there
are E events, Σ is an E × E matrix.
Next, we diagonalize Σ,
Σ = SΛST ,

The eigenvalues are in descending order, λi > λi+1 .
The eigenvectors of Σ are the columns of the similarity matrix, S. The column of S associated with the
largest eigenvalue (λ1 ) is called the principal component,
s1 . This component s1 is a unit vector oriented in the
direction of as much of the report matrix’s variability as
can be captured in a single dimension. This direction of
maximum variability might be thought of as a hypothetical user who maximally contributed as much as possible
to the variability in this particular set of reports.
The projection p1 of the centered data matrix (X)
onto the principal component s1 tells us how much each
user’s reports contributed to this direction of maximum

The algorithm outlined here is a modified version of the
Sztorc consensus algorithm, originally presented in [3]. In
the original algorithm, the first eigenvector of the covariance matrix (the principal component) was solely used,
regardless of the amount of variance it explained. Our
modification is that a fixed fraction of explained variance
is specified. This should make the rewards/punishments
for reporting with/against the consensus more consistent
across different Branches.
Suppose there are E total events being reported on by
N users. We first take the ballot B of votes and construct its weighted covariance matrix, where the weights
are Reputations. The centered ballot (the ballot with

Element ci of the coordination vector is an estimate of
the non-conformity of user i. A high score indicates that
this user contributed a great deal to the system’s overall
variability – that is, the user often disagreed with the
consensus – and therefore was likely not honest. The
user is therefore punished (Fig. 6).
The remainder of our consensus calculation, and Reputation redistribution calculation, is identical to the specification of [3].
Appendix B: Smart Contracts

A decentralized prediction market can be constructed
in a relatively straightforward way using smart contracts,
such as Ethereum [20, 21]. Due to the recent release of

13
Serpent contracts on Counterparty, we are also testing
an alternative implementation of Augur using Serpent.
Counterparty’s announcement frees us to use Bitcoin as
the transactional currency on our platform, instead of
having to use Ethereum’s ether – this will also be remedied on Ethereum itself when sidechains are released.
We think smart contracts may provide an alternative
method for implementing Augur. However, there are several potential barriers related to security and scalability.
We are currently testing our contract implementation
and will update the whitepaper with our results.

Here we present a simple derivation of the logarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR), using the principle of
Maximum Entropy [22–24].
Let qi denote the number of shares outstanding of outcome i, and P (qi ) denote the probability that there are
qi outstanding shares of outcome i. The entropy of the
market is given by the standard form [14, 25]:
X

P (qi ) log P (qi ),

(C1)

i

where the sum is over all possible outcomes in this market. Suppose there are two constraints on the entropy.
The first is the mean number of shares outstanding,
across all outcomes in the market,
hqi =

(C2)

and the second is normalization:
X
P (qi ) = 1.

log P (qi ) + 1 + α + βqi = 0.

Using Eq. C3 to eliminate the normalization parameter
e−1−α , reveals the Boltzmann distribution:

As in statistical physics, Eq. C6 describes a family of
probability distributions, characterized by the value of
the Lagrange multiplier β. The value of β, which is set by
data, is the connection between the information-theoretic
derivation and reality. In thermodynamics, β is the inverse of the system’s temperature; for a market, it is set
by the market’s liquidity. Examining Eq. C6 and Eq. 4, it
is clear that β is set by the LMSR’s loss limit parameter

(C8)

we see that Eq. C6 is identical to the LMSR price function
(Eq. 4):
p (qi ) = P (qi ) = Z −1 eqi /` .

(C9)

Eq. C9 is the result expected for a prediction market: the
price offered for shares of outcome i is exactly equal to
the probability that outcome i will occur.
In this framing, the number of shares qi is analogous
to a thermodynamic energy (or internal energy). The
LMSR’s cost function is just the logarithm of the sum of
statistical weights, which we have identified as the system’s partition function (Eq. C7).
C ({qi }) = −` log Z = hqi + `S.

(C10)

This is identical to the Helmholtz free energy, a thermodynamic function which describes the amount of work required to generate the system’s observed statistical configuration. This configuration is the distribution of energy levels for a thermodynamic system; for a market
governed by the LMSR, it is the share distribution.

The phrase "double coincidence of wants" was coined by Jevons (1875). "The first difficulty in
barter is to find two persons whose disposable possessions mutually suit each other's wants.
There may be many people wanting, and many possessing those things wanted; but to allow of
an actual act of barter there must be a double coincidence, which will rarely happen."

The Bancor Protocol
Abstract: The Bancor protocol enables built-in price discovery1 and a liquidity mechanism for
tokens on smart contract blockchains. These “smart tokens” hold one or more other tokens in
reserve, and enable any party to instantly purchase or liquidate the smart token in exchange for
one of its reserve tokens, directly through the smart token’s contract, at a continuously
calculated price, according to a formula which balances buy and sell volumes.
The Bancor protocol is named in honor of the Keynesian proposal2 to introduce a supranational
reserve currency called Bancor to systematize international currency conversion after WWII.

Background
We live in a world where anyone can publish an article, song or video, create a discussion group
and even run an online marketplace. We are now beginning to witness the emergence of
user-generated currencies. Different types of stored-value (“currencies” hereafter) have been
issued and circulated for centuries in the form of bank notes, bonds, equity, gift cards, loyalty
points, community currencies3 and others. Bitcoin was the first ​decentralized​ digital currency,
followed by a wave of new cryptocurrencies that have been issued since, and recently we’ve
seen the rise of a new asset class of “tokens” that are typically issued in crowdsales (“ICOs”)
through smart contracts.
However, currencies, which are essentially ​networks of value​, do not connect to each other in the
same way that information networks do. While the switches on Internet exchange points (IXs)
interlink information networks, active traders on ​exchanges​ are effectively interlinking currencies.
The current exchange model for currencies/assets has a critical barrier, requiring a certain
volume of trading activity to achieve market-liquidity. This inherent barrier makes it nearly
impossible for small-scale currencies (such as community currencies, loyalty points or other
custom tokens) to be linked (exchangeable) to other popular currencies using a
market-determined exchange rate.
In the age of smart contract blockchains, tokens can be automatically managed by immutable
code which controls their issuance and behavior. We realized this could mean allowing tokens to
hold balances of other tokens (i.e. “reserves”), directly through their smart contracts, that could
be designed by their creators and managed programmatically. These new technological
capabilities warrant rethinking of the possible solutions for converting one currency to another
and determining market prices.

Introducing Smart Tokens: A Solution to the Liquidity Problem
Smart tokens are standard ERC20 tokens which implement the Bancor protocol, providing
continuous liquidity while automatically facilitating price-discovery. The smart token’s contract

instantly processes ​buy​ and ​sell​ orders, which drive the price-discovery process. Due to this
capability, smart tokens do not need to be traded in an exchange in order to become liquid.
A smart token holds a balance of least one other ​reserve token​, which (currently) can be a
different smart token, any ERC20 standard token or Ether. Smart tokens are issued when
purchased and destroyed when liquidated, therefore it is always possible to purchase a smart
token with its reserve token, as well as to liquidate a smart token to its reserve token, at the
current price.

A New Method for Price Discovery
A smart token utilizes a novel method for price-discovery which is based on a “Constant Reserve
Ratio” (CRR). The CRR is set by the smart token creator, for each reserve token, and used in price
calculation, along with the smart token’s current supply and reserve balance, in the following way:

P rice =

Balance
Supply × CRR

This calculation ensures that a constant ratio is kept between the reserve token balance and the
smart token’s market cap, which is its supply times its price. Dividing the market cap by the
supply produces the price according to which the smart token can be purchased and liquidated
through the smart contract. The smart token’s price is denominated in the reserve token and
readjusted by the smart contract per each purchase or liquidation, which increases or decreases
the reserve balance and the smart token supply (and thus the price) as detailed below.
When smart tokens are purchased (in any of their reserve currencies) the payment for the
purchase is added to the reserve balance, and based on the calculated price, ​new smart tokens
are issued​ to the buyer. Due to the calculation above, a purchase of a smart token with a less
than 100% CRR will cause its price to increase, since both the reserve balance and the supply are
increasing, while the latter is multiplied by a fraction.
Similarly, when smart tokens are liquidated, they are ​removed from the supply​ (destroyed), and
based on the current price, reserve tokens are transferred to the liquidator. In this case, for a
smart token with a CRR less than 100%, any liquidation will trigger a price decrease.
This asynchronous price-discovery model works by constantly readjusting the current price
toward an equilibrium between the purchase and liquidation volumes. While in the classic
exchange model price is determined by two matched orders in ​real-time​, smart token prices are
calculated ​over-time​, following every order.
The above formula calculates the current price, however, when a purchase or liquidation is
executed, the effective price is calculated as a function of the transaction size. The calculation
can be described as if every transaction is broken up into infinitely small increments, where each
increment is changing the smart token’s supply, reserve balance, and thus its price. This ensures
that purchasing the same amount of smart tokens in a single or multiple transactions would yield
the same total price. Additionally, this method ensures that the CRR will be kept constant and the
reserve can never be drained. Essentially, the effect of the transaction size on the price (due to its
3

changing the smart token’s supply and reserve balance) is incorporated into the effective price
for any transaction. The mathematical functions for calculating price per transaction size are
presented further in this document.
Using this method, the Bancor protocol can enable liquidity and asynchronous price discovery for
existing​ ​standard tokens​ -- through smart tokens holding them in reserve, enabling backward
compatibility. This use-case and others are described in detail below.

Use-Cases for Smart Tokens
The Long Tail4 of User-Generated Currencies
The long tail phenomena can be observed in many different online ecosystems such as
publishing (blogs), videos (YouTube), discussion forums (Reddit, Facebook Groups) and more. In
each of these examples, the long tail has become significantly larger in scale than everything that
preceded it. The forming of a long tail begins as soon as the barriers to its existence are removed
(e.g. YouTube making it simple for anyone to upload and share user-generated videos).
There are many examples of user-generated currencies, such as group currencies (community
oriented currencies), loyalty points (business oriented currencies), and the most recent being
hundreds of cryptocurrencies (protocol oriented currencies). However, the need to achieve and
maintain liquidity for these small or new currencies remains a significant barrier for their viability.
Smart tokens are unique in that they can be purchased or liquidated by a single party, using the
calculated price, ​removing the need for two opposite wants to be simultaneously matched​. This
effectively means that by using the Bancor protocol, small-scale currencies with a low expected
trade volume can offer continuous liquidity, thus, removing the barrier for them to be linked to the
global economy.
Enabling the long tail of currencies is likely to bring about a new generation of creative
use-cases. Though it’s improbable to predict all of them, some of the more likely use-cases are
listed below.

Crowdfunding a Project
The crowdfunding space has been growing rapidly. Smart tokens can be used for crypto
crowdfunding initiatives, where the participants receive tokens which are liquid and
market-priced. For example, a musician may collect funds to record an album, which would be
sold online exclusively in exchange for the issued tokens. A successful album would generate
high demand for the tokens, driving up their price and rewarding those holding them. Many other
examples exist such as crowdfunding a venture capital fund or raising initial capital for a
credit-creating neighborhood currency.

Token Changers
Token changers are smart tokens that hold multiple reserve tokens, with a total CRR of 100% and
can be used to exchange between any standard ERC20 tokens they hold in reserve. A token
changer is designed to provide an exchange service between its reserve tokens through a
two-step process of purchasing the smart token with one reserve token, and immediately
liquidating it for another.
Due to the price calculation formula, each time reserve token X is converted to reserve token Y -the price of X decreases, while the price of Y increases. Larger transactions will move the price
more sharply, however, a higher reserve balance would reduce price volatility.
As noted, any standard ERC20 token can be used as a reserve-token even if it is already traded
in other exchanges. In such a scenario, a gap may open between the calculated price of a
reserve token and its price in an outside exchange. This situation creates an arbitrage
opportunity which ​incentivizes arbitrageurs to restore economic equilibrium​, thus keeping the
token changer prices in sync with the prices at which their reserve tokens are traded in other
exchanges.
A token changer’s creator may set a conversion fee that would apply on each
purchase/liquidation. Fees can be accumulated in the reserves and thus increase the smart
token’s price with every token conversion taking place, increasing the smart token’s value. This
increase will benefit the holders of the smart token, who may have deposited the original
reserves when the smart token was created, or purchased it with any of its reserve token’s at any
time after that.
Popular exchanges such as MtGox and Bitfinex have been hacked with hundreds of millions of
dollars worth of assets stolen from their accounts. Converting one token to another using a token
changer does not require depositing funds in an exchange and thus removes the counterparty
risk from the process. Another important benefit is that no transaction limits need to be applied,
as is the case with other instant trading solutions, due to the decentralized nature of the token
changer. While decentralized exchanges offer this benefit as well, smart tokens do not rely on
trade volume to provide liquidity.

Decentralized Token Baskets
Smart tokens can be used as decentralized token baskets, which function similarly to ETFs or
index funds, simply by holding a portfolio of reserve tokens with a total CRR of 100%. As prices of
any of the reserve tokens rise or fall, so does the value of the smart token. Similar to token
changers, here as well arbitrageurs are incentivized to realign the conversion rates with market
prices which ensures the proper ratios are kept between the reserves according to their real-time
market value. These smart tokens enable users to directly hold asset baskets, without a financial
services provider as an intermediary.

5

Network Tokens
A collection of smart tokens that use the same reserve token form a ​network of tokens​. The
common reserve token can be described as a ​network token​ which captures the combined value
of the network of tokens which hold it in reserve. Increased demand for any of the smart tokens
in the network would increase demand for the network token, since it is required for purchasing
these tokens, and then held in their reserves. Increased demand drives up the price of the
network token, which ​benefits the entire network​ since the value of the tokens’ reserves
increases, thus to maintain the CRR, the value of the smart tokens also increases. The network
token also functions as a “token for tokens”, rendering all the smart tokens in the network
inter-changeable.
Network tokens can be useful for those who wish to create multiple and related smart tokens for
different purposes (e.g. regional network of community currencies, a video game studio with
multiple game credits, a group of independant businesses issuing a joint loyalty program). The
network token model creates synergetic relationships between the member smart tokens,
comparable to the way any single successful Ethereum service can drive up the value of Ether,
benefiting ​all of​ ​its holders​.
An additional network token use-case is to interlink a set of token changers, each holding a
reserve in the network token and a second reserve in another, standard token. This structure
would enable exchanging any token in the network to another, while increasing the demand for
the network token whenever a new token changer is created or appreciates.

Advantages of Smart Tokens
Smart tokens introduce multiple advantages over the traditional exchange model:
1. Continuous Liquidity​ - Since purchasing and liquidating is done through the smart
contract, smart tokens are always liquid, irrespective of their trading volume.
2. No Extra Fees​ - The only mandatory fees applied by a smart token are the blockchain
platform fees (gas) which are relatively low.
3. No Spread​ - Since the price calculation is done algorithmically by the smart token, the
same price applies for purchasing and liquidating the smart tokens.
4. Predictable Price Slippage ​- Smart tokens allow pre-calculation of the precise price
slippage, based on the transaction size, before it is executed.
5. Lower Volatility - ​A smart token with a 10% CRR (for example) is comparable to an
exchange with 10% of the ​entire supply ​of a token in its order-book at all times, forming
substantial market depth. In a typical crypto-exchange, the share of the supply in the
market depth at any given moment is well below 1%. The higher the CRR, the lower the
smart token’s price volatility. The lower the CRR, the more “new credit” is created relative
to the original reserve amount.

The Bancor Protocol Ecosystem
Different parties can take on different roles in the Bancor network ecosystem. The primary forms
of participation are as follows:
●
●
●

●

End-Users ​can receive, hold, transfer, request, purchase and liquidate smart tokens.
Smart Token Creators ​can issue new, always liquid smart tokens, that may be used for
trading, token changing, as token baskets or as network tokens.
Asset Tokenizers​ (e.g. Tether-USD, Digix-Gold) can issue ERC20 tokens representing
external assets, thus enabling smart tokens to use these assets as reserve tokens.
(Existing crypto-exchanges that operate under their local KYC regulations are well
positioned to provide asset tokenization services.)
Arbitrageurs​ are organically incentivized to constantly reduce gaps between prices on
crypto-exchanges and the Bancor network. Smart tokens work similarly to exchanges in
that purchasing them increases their price and selling them decreases it, so that the same
arbitrage mechanics and incentives apply.

A Solution to the Coincidence of Wants Problem
The coincidence of wants problem5, in the current asset exchange model, creates a situation
where assets are required to be traded at a certain minimal volume or else face liquidity risk6.
The cause for this limitation is that the chance of finding a second party with opposite wants to
exchange with, correlates to the asset’s trading activity level. Smart tokens solve this problem
through the use of reserve tokens which embed market depth directly into the smart token’s
smart contract.
Smart tokens are a ​technological solution​ to the ​coincidence of wants problem​ for ​asset
exchange​, rather than a labor-based solution as used in traditional (or decentralized) exchanges.
The current laborers in asset exchange are the professional market-makers who provide liquidity
and facilitate collaborative price discovery. In the domains of information exchange and trade, the
technologies of writing and currency replaced labor-intensive solutions (speaking and barter) with
technological ones, creating mass efficiencies for societies and unlocking collaboration on a
global and intergenerational level. The Bancor protocol proposes to similarly advance the domain
of asset exchange by replacing the need for labor with a technological solution to the existing
coincidence of wants problem.

Smart Token Initiation and Customization
New smart tokens can be created simply by depositing an initial reserve/s and issuing the initial
token supply. Alternatively smart tokens can be initiated through a crowdsale, where a part of the
proceeds is allocated as the initial reserve.

The Bprotocol Foundation
Bprotocol is a Swiss nonprofit foundation whose core objective is the establishment of the
Bancor protocol as a global standard for intrinsically tradeable currencies.
By contributing to the Bprotocol Foundation, users will generate BNT - the first smart token to be
deployed using the Bancor protocol, establishing the ​BNT network. ​The Foundation will
collaborate with different contractors to achieve its goals, as well as governments, businesses,
academia and NGOs committed to realizing collaboration potential in communities around the
world.

Bancor Network Token (BNT) - The First Smart Token
The BNT will hold a single reserve in Ether. Other smart tokens, by using BNT as (one of) their
reserve(s), connect to the BNT network using the price discovery method outlined in this paper.
The BNT network will include user-generated smart tokens, token changers (forming a global
decentralized, highly liquid exchange), decentralized token baskets as well as subnetworks.
The BNT establishes network dynamics where increased demand for ​any​ of the network’s smart
tokens increases demand for the common BNT, benefiting ​all​ other smart token​s​ holding it in
reserve. Naturally, it is also susceptible to decreased demand. The BNT will be sold in a
fundraiser scheduled for June, 12, 2017 10:00 GMT.

BNT Crowdsale Objectives

●

●

A portion of the funds raised will be used as the Ether reserve for BNT (details on the CRR
will be outlined in the crowdsale launch announcement), enabling continuous liquidity to
Ether for any BNT holder, as well as any holder of a smart token using BNT as a reserve.
A portion of the funds will be used to develop, promote and support the open-sourced,
blockchain-agnostic, Bancor protocol implementations, and support related technologies
and applications such as an open-source, user-friendly web service (desktop and mobile)
to provide wallet, marketplace, token-conversion, new smart token creation and
crowdsale solutions.
A portion of the funds will be used to set-up and propel the first batch of token changers
for popular ERC20 tokens, which function as a ​decentralized solution for token exchange
between all the included tokens. This model introduces key advantages, incentivizing
asset tokenizer​s to represent additional real-world assets as Ethereum tokens.
A portion of the funds will be used to participate in and support innovative and promising
future smart token crowdsales in the BNT network. These may include new,
location-based and vertical-specific smart token initiatives such as regional token
networks, community currencies, crowdfunded projects and other online or offline
token-based ecosystems.

Examples and Illustrations
Example #1: Smart Token Transaction Flows
In this example, a crowdsale for a new token (BNT) has collected 300,000 ETH.
300,000 BNT are issued at a 1:1 ratio and transferred to the
crowdsale participants. 240,000 ETH were directed towards
funding the BNT project’s development and 60,000 (20%
CRR) were kept in the BNT smart contract as a reserve.
●

Purchasing and liquidating BNT becomes possible as
soon as the crowdsale is completed. The opening
price is the last crowdsale price, in this example 1
ETH for the first BNT.

●

BNT liquidators get ETH from the reserve of BNT, the
liquidated BNT are destroyed, and the BNT price
decreases respectively.

●

BNT buyers get newly minted BNT, their payment in
ETH is added to the smart contract reserve and the
BNT price increases.

The ETH reserve always remains 20% of the BNT market
cap.

Example #2: Token Changer Transaction Flows
In this example, a “BNTGNO” smart token is created to function as a token changer between BNT
and GNO (Gnosis), holding both in reserve with a 50% CRR each, for a total of a 100% CRR.
Assuming a current market price of 1
BNT = 2 GNO, the contract can
define the initial prices as 1 BNT = 2
GNO = 1 BNTGNO and in this
example, 10,000 BNTGNO are issued
to the depositors of the initial
reserves.
●

●

●

The opening prices are 1
BNTGNO = 1 BNT = 2 GNO as
was set in the contract.
The BNTGNO can be
purchased with BNT or GNO.
The BNTGNO price will increase for the reserve token it was purchased with (BNT or
GNO), and decrease in the uninvolved reserve token (due to the increase in the BNTGNO
supply).
BNTGNO can be liquidated back to BNT or GNO, decreasing the BNTGNO price in the
liquidated reserve token, and increasing it in the uninvolved reserve token.

This scenario demonstrates how a 100% backed smart token with two 50% CRR reserve tokens
can function as a decentralized token changer, open for anyone to use, with its prices organically
balanced by arbitrageurs. Both the token changer and the token basket automatically maintain
their CRR ratios.

Summary
The Bancor protocol standardizes smart tokens, enabling asynchronous price discovery and
continuous liquidity for cryptocurrencies using constant ratios of reserve tokens held through
smart contracts, acting as automated market makers. The Bancor protocol enables the creation
of hierarchical monetary systems with no liquidity risk. The BNT will be used to establish the first
decentralized interconnected currency exchange system which does not rely on matching bid
and ask orders, thus remaining liquid irrespective of its trading volume. This system proposes the
first technological solution for the ​Coincidence of Wants Problem​ in asset exchange, enabling the
long tail of user-generated currencies to emerge.

Basic Attention Token (BAT)
Blockchain Based Digital Advertising
Brave Software
May 29, 2017

Abstract
Digital advertising is broken. The marketplace for online advertising, once dominated by advertisers, publishers and users, has become overrun by “middleman” ad
exchanges, audience segmentation, complicated behavioral and cross-device user
tracking, and opaque cross-party sharing through data management platforms.
Users face unprecedented levels of malvertisements and privacy violations. Mobile advertising results in as much as $23 per month in data charges on the average
user’s data plan, slow page loads, and as much as 21% less battery life. In response,
over 600 million mobile devices and desktops (globally) employ ad blocking software and this number is growing. Traditional publishers have lost approximately
66% of their revenue over the past decade, adjusted for inflation. Publishers face
falling revenue, users feel increasingly violated, and advertisers’ ability to assess
effectiveness is diminished. The solution is a decentralized, transparent digital ad
exchange based on Blockchain. The first component is Brave, a fast, open source,
privacy-focused browser that blocks third party ads and trackers, and builds in a
ledger system that measures user attention to reward publishers accordingly. Brave
will now introduce BAT (Basic Attention Token), a token for a decentralized ad
exchange. It compensates the browser user for attention while protecting privacy.
BAT connects advertisers, publishers, and users and is denominated by relevant
user attention, while removing social and economic costs associated with existing
ad networks, e.g., fraud, privacy violations, and malvertising. BAT is a payment
system that rewards and protects the user while giving better conversion to advertisers and higher yield to publishers. We see BAT and associated technologies
as a future part of web standards, solving the important problem of monetizing
publisher content while protecting user privacy.

Value Proposition

We propose the BAT as a token of exchange in a secure, anonymous, opt-in advertising
system based in the browser and the mobile app webview. The BAT system provides:
• Users: strong privacy and security when viewing advertisements, improved relevance and performance, and a share of tokens.
• Publishers: improved revenue, better reporting, and less fraud.
• Advertisers: less expensive customer attention, less fraud, and better attribution.

Introduction
“Attention has been widely recognized as a commodity, like wheat, pork bellies
or crude oil. Existing industries have long depended on it to drive sales. And
the new industries of the twentieth century turned it into a form of currency
they could mint. Beginning with radio, each new medium would attain its
commercial viability through the resale of what attention it could capture in
exchange for its ’free’ content.” -Tim Wu, Attention Brokers

The promise of advertising technology (“ad-tech”) was to create a more efficient
marketplace for attention. The hope was that the Internet, the latest kind of “new
medium,” would arrive with a transparent and efficient ad marketplace.
In theory, excellence would be rewarded. The best journalism and entertainment
would receive the attention and funding it deserved. Ad tech would “get marketers
closer to their users via data analysis, immediate valuation and distribution.” Data
would be used to “accurately identify audiences, determine the value of those audiences,
and deliver the right messages to them instantly.”[1] In short, users’ attention would be
valued properly.
That didn’t happen. Instead, the ad-tech ecosystem that has evolved over the last
two decades is a bewildering variety of middlemen and complexity. Worse, ad-tech
introduced a host of correlated problems for publishers, advertisers and users. Users
have lost their privacy, face increasing malware, pay high charges to download ads, and
suffer slow speeds. Publishers have lost billions in revenue while fraud has skyrocketed.
And advertisers face poor reporting and targeting.
This paper will review the current state of ad-tech and the predicament of content producers. It will outline a new solution that creates a transparent and efficient
Blockchain-based marketplace for publishers, advertisers and users, accurately valuing
and rewarding the key driver of Internet content: durable user attention.

2.1

An Inefficient and Troubled Market

Thomas Davenport and JC Beck note that “attention is focused mental engagement
on a particular item of information. Items come into our awareness, we attend to a
3

particular item, and then we decide whether to act.”[2] Attention is, in this sense, a
form of scarcity, which raises fundamental economic questions, which we shall address
momentarily.
Advertising, throughout history, has been used as the primary mechanism to capture
Attention, raise it to a level of Interest to incite some Desire that can then translate
it into Action – otherwise known as AIDA.[3] The earliest forms of advertising date
to ancient China, Egypt and the Middle Ages in Europe. The print form of advertising began to expand widely with the growth of 19th Century printed products. This
marketplace of advertisers, publishers and users remained relatively straightforward –
despite some additions – even as the new media of radio and television arose.
The rise of the Internet brought the development of a new level of advertising technology with the promise of higher speed and better information, two critical elements
that had the potential to radically improve the efficiency of the attention marketplace.
Somewhat counter-intuitively, the sheer complexity and opacity that organically developed has brought the opposite result. The system isn’t working as it should. As the
Chief Brand officer of the largest advertiser, P&G, said recently:
“The days of giving digital a pass are over. It’s time to grow up. It’s time
for action.”[4]
Especially in the last decade, the advertising ecosystem has become more complex
and crowded, with many more players taking a piece of the advertising pie, either
directly or indirectly. The complexity of this ecosystem increases the cost in headcount
and difficulty of the tasks for the digital marketing teams on the advertiser’s side. At
the other end of the system, the typical publisher faces both a shrinking market for the
ad-blocker-free attention, and a shrinking slice of the advertising revenue pie due to the
multitude of third party players who act as economic middlemen in the transaction.

2.2

The Attention Marketplace:

Sales planners currently budgeting for brand advertising are required to account for
an excessive number of intermediaries that stand between the ad and the end user.
Agencies, trading desks, demand side platforms, desktop and mobile network exchanges,
yield optimization, rich media vendors and partnered services often consume significant
portions of creative and delivery ad budget. It is also common for agencies in charge
of packaging brand campaigns to use data aggregators, data management platforms,
data suppliers, analytics, measurement and verification services to fight fraud, enhance
targeting, and confirm attribution. These factors add up to a high transaction cost on
the efficient provision of attention to brand ad campaigns.

4

Publishers also face a number of costs and intermediaries on the receiving side of
the ads served. Publishers pay ad serving fees, operational fees for campaign setup,
deployment and monitoring, publisher analytics tools; also they give up substantial
revenue to some of the same intermediaries that the brand advertisers use via programmatic ads. Publishers face direct costs of user complaints when malvertising spreads
from exchanges to loyal readers, often with little or no idea of origin and with no help
from the ad exchanges responsible for allowing such ads to serve from their systems.
These diminish net revenue as the overall complexity of the advertising ecosystem raises
headcount and expense.
There is a hidden cost to this complexity. A single ad unit may bounce across
many networks, buy and sell-side ad servers, verification partners and data management
platforms. Publishers lose revenue from each middleman transaction. Each one of
these transactions also detracts from the user experience. Many of the middle players
involve data transfers, which add latency. Any transfers done via script on page eat
into the user’s data plan and battery life on mobile. Users often find their experience
further diminished when the results finally arrive, confounded by a bewildering array
of distracting ads the publisher allowed to be placed in hope of greater revenue.
In addition, the violation of user privacy exacts a significant social cost; economists
have compared violations of user privacy as analogous to environmental pollution.[5]
According to Pew Research, “Fully 91% of adults agree or strongly agree that users have
lost control of how personal information is collected and used by companies.”[6] A large
majority, 64%, believe that the “government should do more to regulate advertisers”
regarding how they use and store personal information. This is not surprising, given
that a visit to a popular media site can often have 70 trackers set loose on the reader.
Fraud is also a major problem afflicting the advertising marketplace. Hackers create malicious bots that produce bogus websites that fool advertisers. Internet “bots,”
5

Figure 1: Typical Digital Ad Flow

Figure 3: Data Transferred by Data Elements on News Sites

remote-controlled software running on compromised personal computers or cloud infrastructure programmed to engage in criminal activities -siphon billions of dollars each
year from the ad industry. According to Business Intelligence: “These bots create websites filled with infringed content and generate fake traffic through a complex network
of infected computers. In 2016, ad fraud created by internet bots is expected to cost
advertisers $7.2 billion, up from $6.3 billion in 2015, according to a report from the
Association of National Advertises (ANA) and White Ops.”[7] There is no sign of this
level of fraud leveling off or reducing.
Advertisers face fraud, while users are increasingly encountering malvertisements.
Malvertisements are fake ads that trick users into clicking on them and then downloading
malicious code, including ransomware. They can also entice users to visit fake domains
used to steal financial information. According to a RiskIQ report released last year,
“malvertising advert rates [rose] by 132% from 2015 to 2016.” The sites most frequently
hit by malvertising, according to Bromium[8], are news and entertainment sites.
Web users are also not fully aware of the costs they pay for privilege of seeing
advertisements. According to Business Intelligence, one study found that up to 79%
of mobile data transferred during visits to popular publishers was a result of ads. The
researchers compared data usage when a full page loaded without an ad blocker, with
an ad blocker, and with an ad blocker and JavaScript disabled.
The article noted that the researchers concluded that “advertising accounts for half
of all the data used by publisher pages loaded over mobile data networks” during the
tests. The average smartphone user consumes 1.8GB a month. Based on carrier plans
for 2Gb, this means that average users end up paying up to $23 a month to download
ads, trackers, scripts and other related data.[9]

7

Figure 4: Sites Most Frequently Hit By Malvertising

Figure 5: Content Loading Cost Comparison

8

Figure 6: Ad Blocker Growth by Device

A study by the New York Times found the data used by advertising resulted in
significant download times and costs across 50 top publishing sites. On one extreme,
www.boston.com took 30.8 seconds for advertising and 8.2 seconds for editorial. The
article concluded that removing ads saved “more than five seconds of loading time over
a typical cell connection” for the articles studied. The data to load the ads came with
a financial cost as well – the price for the advertising content often outweighs that of
editorial material.
The sum total of malvertisements, load times, data costs, battery life, and privacy
loss has driven users to adopt ad-blocking software. This further reduces publisher
revenues and leaves the remaining ad-viewing audience even harder to target.
Ad blockers are a growing problem for publishers. Studies confirm that users of ad
blocking software prefer the simplicity of navigation of ad-free or nearly ad-free content.
Over 600 million mobile and desktop devices now use ad blocking, according to
Pagefair. It is projected that 86.6M Americans will use an ad blocker in 2017[10].
Younger users are also more likely to adopt ad blocking technology, making the longterm financial impact of this technology worse than it appears at first glance[11].
This “perfect storm” for publishers has only gotten worse over the last few years
as Google and Facebook have taken more and more share of advertising revenues. Together they claim over 73% of online digital ad revenue, and an astounding 99% of all
growth from 2015 to 2016 in US total online ad budget[12]. The increased attention
for publishers brought by Google and Facebook would seem to be a net positive. But
the traffic driven by social media is of lower quality than direct links. Users who arrive at a news site from social media typically only engage with the site for a third[13]
9

Figure 7: Demographics of Ad Blocker Usage

of the time compared to those who are direct visitors. Distributed content hosting
makes up only 14% of publisher revenues, with the majority of the revenue coming from
Youtube[14]; many publishers have experienced serious commodification problems with
these platforms.
Advertisers on these platforms also face serious challenges. The sheer size of the
platforms make them opaque and difficult to assess the effectiveness of advertising campaigns on their platforms. Since most of the analytics products targeting these platforms
are provided by the platform owner, principal-agent conflicts arise. Some advertisers
have decided that traffic coming from the walled gardens isn’t worth the trouble. Some
have even suggested based on third party analytics that a large proportion of the traffic
is without value to the advertiser[15].
In an effort to expand their walled gardens and to reinforce market dominance by
traffic and data otherwise ingested from users directly on the publisher domain, major
platform players have begun offering alternative content delivery channels with claims
of incentivized placement and a faster, more secure user experience. While Facebook
Instant Articles, Google AMP project and Apple News delivery channels were initially
presented to publishers as opportunities to extend reach and visibility, they ultimately
diminish publishers’ control of their brand narratives and reader relationships, and
divert direct attention away from publisher sites over the long run.
Generally speaking, the publishing industry faces an existential threat. Legacy
publishers have faced declining revenues for decades. Pressures on publishers to create
content optimized for clicks has resulted in cut-backs to long form articles, investigative
journalism, and foreign news bureaus, and has spawned the much lamented social cost
revealingly named “clickbait.” This dysfunctional dynamic has been noticed across the
industry. Marketing budgets continue to climb[16], yet publisher revenues are static or
shrinking[17]. This indicates serious market inefficiencies which can be repaired with a

A New Deal: Attention-based Economics on Blockchain

The diversity of middle-men and the lack of value-add to the publisher and user make
some sort of simplification of the present online advertising ecosystem inevitable. Present
trends are toward an oligopoly where gatekeeper companies such as Google and Facebook control the entire online marketing budget with publishers powerless to control
their revenues. Also, as users continue to adopt ad blocking technology the consequent
shrinking of the remaining ad-funded market seems inevitable.
The reality remains: user attention is valuable, but it hasn’t been properly priced
with an efficient and transparent market system. While it has become a platitude
that vast amounts of information are generated on and by the Internet, human beings
are only able to devote a limited amount of attention to certain small subsets of the
information. Information in the modern age is relatively cheap. Human attention paid
to the information is the rare quantity. As Herbert Simon put it in an influential 1971
article:
“. . . in an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth
of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes.
What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of
its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention
and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of
information sources that might consume it.”
Ultimately, a publisher provides information which may be of value to the user.
Users give attention to the publisher in return for information that they value with
their attention. At present, the publisher is paid by monetizing attention via a complex
network of intermediary players through ad networks and other such tools. The publisher isn’t paid directly for the attention given by the user. The publisher is actually
paid for the indirectly measured attention given by users to ads. Publishers are used to
working with this model for print ads, but web ads remain problematic for many of the
reasons stated above. Users are subjected to the negative externalities that come with
the present advertising ecosystem.
Users thus suffer a form of “electronic pollution” consisting of threats to security,
threats to privacy, costs in inefficient download times, financial costs in extra mobile data
fees, and in the case of the many ads, excessive costs to their attention. Human attention
can be exhausted, until dopamine levels recover. Neurons can and do learn to ignore
ad slots (so-called “banner blindness”). Abuse of user attention and permanent loss
of users, via ad-slot blindness and ad-blocker adoption, make attention different from
substitutable commodities such as pork bellies or crude oil, in the final analysis. While
most users may be willing to pay some price for access to the publisher’s information,
user attention is mispriced when we sum up the growing negative externalities imposed
by the present advertising ecosystem.

3.1

Basic Attention Metrics (BAM)

To improve the efficiency of digital advertising requires a new platform and unit of
exchange. The first phase involves the roll-out of a new browser, Brave, a fast, open
source, privacy-focused browser that blocks invasive ads and trackers, and contains a
ledger system that anonymously measures user attention to accurately reward publishers. The next phase involves the introduction of Basic Attention Token or BAT. It is
a token for the decentralized ad exchange. BAT connects advertisers, publishers, and
users, creating a new, efficient marketplace. The token is based on Ethereum technology,
an open source, blockchain-based distributed computing platform with smart contracts.
These cryptographically secure smart contracts are stateful applications stored in the
Ethereum blockchain, fully capable of enforcing performance. The token is derived
from – or denominated by – user attention. Attention is really just focused mental
engagement – on an advertisement, in this case.
The ability to privately monitor user intent at the browser level allows for the development of rich metrics for user attention. For example, it is known whether an
impression has been served to an active tab, and measure the seconds of active user
engagement. Attention is measured as viewed for content and ads only in the browser’s
active tab in real time. The Attention Value for the ad will be calculated based on incremental duration and pixels in view in proportion to relevant content, prior to any direct
engagement with the ad. We will define further anonymous cost-per-action models as
the system develops.
In-device machine learning will match truly relevant ads to content from a level that
middlemen with cookies and third party tracking are unable to achieve, regardless of
how much of the user data is extracted and monitored from external models. These
external models are still unable to track transactions well enough not to serve ads
for products users have often already purchased. User engagement through genuine
feedback mechanisms ensures that users that have opted in for BAT are getting the
best possible product match that they’re most likely to convert into a transaction.
Ultimately it comes down to trust and respect with and for the user. By keeping the
data on the device only, encrypting the data and shielding the identities of our users
as a core principle, BAT forms a bond with users that proves that not only does their
data hold value, it holds substantial value that has been ignored and exploited by the
middlemen year after year in the current industry model.
Several scoring algorithms have been tried with the Brave donation ledger system,
which automatically donates an amount proportional to the attention given to a website.
One of the metrics suggested is 5 total views of advertising content in an active
window, for at least 5 seconds each. Hits of this nature would be calculated on a 30-day
moving window.
Another suggested metric is the “concave” score[18]. This is a score which rewards
a publisher for a thresholded and bounded function of the amount of time spent with
the open and active page. For example, one “point” could be awarded for a two second
view of the page, with two points for a 30 second view, and 3 for a 60 second view, with
diminishing or bounded returns for longer views.
13

Figure 10: Basic Attention Metric Score Over Time

The present implementation of the concave score, which is being used to distribute
attention metered donations to the publishers, is a thresholded, time limited quadratic
score. The formula is as follows:
√
−b + b2 + 4a ∗ duration
score =
2a
where a = 13000, b = 11000 and duration is measured in milliseconds. This gives a
minimum threshold of 25 seconds to achieve a score of 1. The upper bound is set to be
around 12 minutes of attention given to the article, with a maximum score for a given
piece of content of 7. This can be seen in figure 10.
Another potential metric is a targeted ad based on a subset of keywords purchased
at the advertising partner end, combined with the attention metric, essentially selling
the attention along with an advertising topic.
We expect publishers and advertisers to suggest new metrics of user attention to be
surfaced, and encourage other vendors to build on the topic as we progress.

3.2

Token Technology

The Basic Attention Token (BAT), a token based on Ethereum, is an important element of a new marketplace. Ethereum is an open source, blockchain-based, distributed
computing platform oriented towards smart contracts. Effectively, Ethereum is a dis-

14

Figure 11: Value Flow of the Basic Attention Token

tributed virtual machine that allows end users to construct smart contracts for transactions. Smart contracts are stateful applications stored in the Ethereum blockchain.
These contracts are cryptographically secure and can verify or enforce performance of
the contract. Token contracts are a standard feature of the Ethereum ecosystem.
Ethereum has been used for mobile payment systems, distributed exchanges, tokens
pegged to commodities and fiat currencies, market clearing mechanisms, micropayment
systems for distributed computing resources, commodities and securities exchanges,
crowdfunding, and legal document verification. Large firms have invested in and deployed Ethereum, with JP Morgan, Deloitte, IBM, Santander Bank, Microsoft, the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and the Royal Bank of Scotland being key early adopters.
Micropayments using BAT will be accomplished for the first stage deployment with
the Brave Micropayments Ledger. Each viewed ad will be verified at the browser using
the BAM.
This flow shows the conceptual flow of the BAT payments. The flow of the BAT
payments will not follow this chart precisely in first iterations of the BAT payment
system as the payments will be regulated by the Brave ledger system, but the total
effect will be the same. The high-level concept is the advertiser sends a payment in
token along with ads to users in a locked state Xa. As the users view the ads, the
flow of payments unlocks, keeping part of the payment for their own wallet (Xu), and
passing on shares of the payment to Brave (Xb) and passing the remainder on to the
Publisher (Xa-Xu-Xb).
The BAT will, in early stages, be specifically tied to Brave browsers and Brave
15

servers, along with verified publishers. Ad fraud will be prevented or reduced by publication of source code and cryptographically secure transactions. Ads served to individual browser/users will also be rate-limited and tied to active windows and tabs.
Payments in BAT will be sent only to publishers, though a payment for viewing an ad
on one publisher may be used at another publisher or kept for some other premium
services supplied through the BAT system.

3.3

Tokens Used as Publisher Payment

Publisher payment will be through the BAT system. For the first deployment of BAT,
the transactions in BAT will take place through the Brave Ledger system, which is an
open source Zero Knowledge Proof scheme presently deployed to allow Brave users to
make anonymous donations to publishers using bitcoin as the medium of exchange. The
Brave Ledger system uses the ANONIZE[19] algorithm to protect user privacy.
For the first incarnation of BAT, all payments in BAT must have a publisher endpoint. The publisher client as it is coded today already measures user attention as
described above. The “concave” awarding mechanism calculates an attention score
based on a fixed threshold value for opening and viewing the page for a minimum of 25
seconds, and a bounded score for the amount of time spent on the page. A synopsis of
user behavior is then sent back to the Brave Ledger System for recording and payments
made on the basis of the scores.
Much of the infrastructure required to deploy BAT at the back end is presently code
complete, in place and being used to distribute donations based on user attention. As
such, this infrastructure will be leveraged to deploy BAT as soon as possible for testing,
user, and advertiser feedback.
A fully distributed ledger is desirable, both for public accountability and potential scalability reasons. Publishers, advertisers and users of the BAT token will have
incentive to use such a system to keep track of payments within the BAT system.
State channels allow for multiple small transactions with strong anonymity guarantees when using the correct matching algorithms. While Raiden and other state channel
schemes are becoming integrated with the Ethereum ecosystem, and new blockchains
such as Zcash and Monero offer stronger privacy guarantees with rapidly increasing
feature sets, it is likely that a new scheme addressing the unique problems of this type
of transaction will be used for large scale multiparty transfer of BAT.
A lottery system may be used, where small payments are made probabilistically, with
payments happening essentially in the same way that coin mining works with proof of
attention instead of proof of work[20, 21], BOLT[22], Zero Knowledge SNARK[23] or
STARK[24] algorithms may become part of this stack for guarding privacy of participants. The BAT situation is mitigated by the fact that the privacy of the browser
customer is of primary importance; publishers and advertisers have fewer privacy concerns. The transactions in a fully distributed BAT system will almost always be one to
many and many to one, therefore novel zero-knowledge transactions may be suggested
by this arrangement.
As Brave moves to a fully distributed micropayment system, we expect other devel16

opers to use our free and open source infrastructure to develop their own use cases for
BAT. We want BAT and the tools associated with it to eventually become important
web standards for future development of web content. Publishers, advertisers and users
who view web content deserve a private, secure and well-engineered future.

3.4

Tokens for User Applications

As users are given access to some of the advertising spend in BAT, they will become
an important and active part of the advertising and publishing economy, rather than
the passive participants they are presently treated as. While tokens can be donated to
individual content providers and publishers, there are any number of use cases for the
tokens.
An obvious use case is for very specific targeted advertising. Many small businesses
have modest requirements which may be well served by tokens they acquire through
their normal browsing activities. Users may also find new uses with low barrier to
entry highly targeted ads; personal ads targeting people of a religion or subculture for
example.
Some publishers may have premium content they would ordinarily only offer to
subscribers. Since subscription models are not typically favored by users on the internet,
this could unlock new revenue for premium content providers. Content may also be
bought for friends using the token; if someone likes a premium article, they can make a
micropayment to send it to three of their friends.
Higher quality content may also be offered to users for a BAT transaction. For
example, higher quality video or audio on an entertainment channel, or some kind of
summary of headlines in a news source. Video or audio content in a news or other
information source may be restricted to people who pay a small micropayment.
Comments may be ranked or voted on using BAT tokens, similar to the “thumbsup/thumbsdown” on some comment sections. Comment votes backed by BAT may be
given more credibility due to the fact that someone cared enough to back the comment
with what would be a limited supply of token, as well as the fact that a token transfer can be verified as coming from real people rather than robots. The right to post
comments may also be purchased for some minimal payment, to cut down on abusive
commenters.
Eventually, BAT may be used within the Brave ecosystem to purchase digital goods
such as high resolution photos, data services, or publisher applications which are only
needed on a one-time basis. Many publishers have access to interesting data sets and
tools which they are not able to monetize on a subscription basis, but which individuals
may wish to occasionally use. For example, firms such as Pro Publica, Citzen Audit
and Gartner contain interesting public data and premium content, but many individuals
find a subscription too costly. Small parts of news archives may also be of interest to
people who do not want to purchase access or a subscription to the entire archive.
BAT may also be used in games provided by publishers within the Brave ecosystem. While such applications are not presently popular with publishers, many platform
providers have hosted profitable gaming applications. It could create a new economy of
17

app creators to go along with content. For example, ’punch the political/entertainment
figure’ games to go along with critical articles. People won’t get out their credit card to
use such an application, but they may be willing to part with some value they acquired
in normal browsing activities to enjoy punching their favorite entertainment figure.
Custom news alerts may be offered as a service by news providers for a small payment
of BAT within the ecosystem. Such news alerts may be very valuable to individuals
who are concerned with current events, financial news or some anticipated event.

3.5

Roadmap

• Pre 1.0 BAT: Brave already has an anonymized ledger system for making donations and payments to publishers based on user attention. The secure vault using
the ANONYZE algorithm to ensure customer privacy is an important piece of the
BAT ecosystem which is already in place and deployed in Brave. Brave is already
measuring user attention at the browser level and distributing donations to the
publishers using this system.
• 1.0 BAT: BAT wallet integrated with the Brave browser. Verification and transactions to be handled by Brave’s internal Zero Knowledge Proof ledger system to
protect individual user anonymity from advertisers, publishers and third parties.
Ad inventory will be valued, and transactions will be calculated from reported
Basic Attention Metric (BAM) data.
• Beyond 1.0 BAT: Make the transfer and verification process entirely distributed
on Ethereum using a state channel scheme with Zero Knowledge Proof protocol
for ensuring user privacy. Add alternate BAM metrics based on advertiser feedback. This will allow for full user privacy as well as a decentralized audit trail for
advertisers, users and publishers to ensure they received correct payments for the
advertising delivered through the BAT network.
• Browser as platform/BAT: Further BAM metrics based on advertiser feedback as
needed. Partners building applications on the BAT infrastructure. Also, at this
point we plan to explore value-added services that can be offered to users on the
browser platform through BAT.

Business landscape

4.1

Competition

• Reddit Gold is a premium membership program, granting access to extra features
to improve experience. Reddit is a major publisher, but this program is designed
by and limited to Reddit. It does not offer publishers a mechanism for publishers
and users to monetize through the use of Blockchain-based token.
• Steem is a social-media and blogging platform lets users earn revenue when they
receive upvotes. It is a kind of monetized Reddit. Steem does use Blockchain, but
18

it is not a generalized means for publishers and users to be rewarded for content.
In short, it is not a Blockchain-based digital ad platform. It is specific to the
Steem platform.
• Blendle is a kind of iTunes for journalism, offering micropayments on a per-story
basis. It gives readers a collection of stories based on preferences. Brave and
BAT do not curate anything. Users merely go about their business on the web
and publishers are rewarded. Blendle is not a token-based digital advertising
platform.
• Google is a search engine company that makes most of its revenue from digital
advertising. Google is at the center of the existing digital advertising ecosystem.
They benefit from the complexity and opaqueness that defines it. BAT intends to
empower the very users and publishers that are receiving less than they should.
Google does not have a Blockchain-based tokenized system of offering rewards.
Users are often unaware of how their privacy is compromised using Google.

BAT Overview

The Basic Attention Token (BAT) was developed to address the broken digital advertising market. BAT, an ERC20 token built on top of Ethereum, will be the unit of
exchange in a new, decentralized, open source and efficient blockchain-based digital advertising platform. In the ecosystem, advertisers will give publishers BATs based on the
measured attention of users. Users will also receive some BATs for participating. They
can donate them back to publishers or use them on the platform. This transparent
system keeps user data private while delivering fewer but more relevant ads. Publishers
experience less fraud while increasing their percentage of rewards. And advertisers get
19

better reporting and performance. The first part of the solution, the Brave browser, is
already operational. Brave is a fast, open source, privacy-focused browser that blocks
invasive ads and trackers, and contains a ledger system that anonymously measures user
attention aggregate to accurately reward publishers. The next step is introducing BAT.
Currently, we plan to utilize the Brave Browser for BAT, but other developers are
free to utilize other browsers.
Brave is more than a browser: it defends your data on your devices and synchronizes
your personal and private browsing profile across devices using client-side encryption.
Your data, studied and abstracted by on-device-only machine learning, provides you
with private and anonymous options to get compensated for your attention. Brave cuts
out all third-party trackers and middle-players, eliminating data leakage, malware risk,
and excessive fee-taking. Brave does this while providing publishers with a substantially larger revenue share than they are receiving in existing inefficient and opaque
marketplaces.
Brave thus aims to reset the online ad-based Web ecosystem, giving advertisers, publishers and customers a win-win solution whose components and protocols can become
future Web standards.

BAT FAQs

What does BAT stand for and what is it?
Basic Attention Token. The BAT, a token based on the Ethereum technology, is a
unit of exhange in a new Blockchain based digital advertising system. User attention is
anonymously monitored in the Brave browser and publishers are rewarded accordingly
with BATs. Users also get a share of BATs for participating.
What do BATs represent?
BATs are tokens in a new Blockchain and attention-based digital advertising platform.
They are not refundable, nor are they securities or for speculation. There is no promise
of future performance. There is no suggestion or promise that BAT has or will hold a
particular value. BATs give no rights in the company and do not represent participation
in the company. BATs are sold as a functional good. Any value received by company
may be spent without conditions. BATs are meant only for experts in cryptographic
tokens and blockchain-based software systems.
What amount is being raised? Whats the cap of tokens? Will there be a
follow-on offering?
We are targeting a raise of as much as $24 million USD and a cap of 1.5 billion tokens.
We do not plan to have a follow-on offering.
What crypto-currencies are accepted in the crowdsale?
ETH will be accepted in the crowdsale. You will be required to have an Ethereum
wallet pointed at the token/crowdsale address to participate in the crowdsale. BAT are
Ethereum derived tokens. If you hold BTC or some other crypto-currency it can be
exchanged for ETH and used to participate in the crowdsale.
When will the Crowdsale happen?
We’re working with security auditors to finalize the contract. When they have completed
their analysis we will announce the date. Note that the BAT crowdsale parameters will
be tied to blocknumber, so times will depend on Ethereum mining rates. The contract
will be pushed to Ethereum mainnet 3 days before the crowdsale starts. We’ll also give
people a week to interact with the contract on Ropsten/testnet.
What is the price of BAT?
BAT will be a fixed ratio to ETH. This may vary slightly with ETH volatility as we get
closer to the contract deployment date. The exchange rate will be 6400 BAT per ETH.

24

How will Brave use ETH raised during token launch?
The ETH received in the crowdsale will by used by Brave Software to build out the
Blockchain-based digital advertising system, which uses BATs as a unit of exchange.
How will Brave store ETH?
Brave will use the standard Ethereum multisig wallet to store ETH.
Are BAT tokens transferable?
Crowdsale tokens are immediately transferable. Tokens used in the Browser may only
be donated or used to pay publishers for premium content or for other services. Tokens
may also be used by publishers for promotions.

Appendix
A More Efficient Market: Coase Theorem

Problems involving social and transactions costs have been studied by economists.
Ronald H. Coase was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1991 for his work on the
allocation of radio frequency resources.[25] Modern problems in ad-tech are addressable
using the work of Coase and subsequent commenters on his idea. At present, the effects
of today’s overcomplicated advertising ecosystem is a negative externality or “social
cost” for the user. The user’s privacy is invaded, the browsing experience compromised,
and even the limited supply of internet bandwidth on mobile devices is depleted by the
present state of this ecosystem. Effectively, the market for user attention has become
inefficient; the transaction costs of advertisers purchasing attention have become too
high.
The widespread adoption of ad blocking technology adds a negative externality on
the publishers as well. If everyone blocked advertisements, there would be little content
left to exchange for user attention, as publishers go out of business. An efficient market
for attention would remove these negative externalities, or compensate all parties to the
transaction in an efficient way.
The Coase theorem states that trade in an externality or “social cost” is possible.
If there are sufficiently low transaction costs, information symmetry, and well defined
property rights, bargaining will lead to a Pareto-efficient outcome regardless of the
initial allocation of property.
The standard textbook example of the Coase theorem consists of a factory which
produces pollution as a side-effect of the manufacturing process, and a neighboring
landowner who suffers from the pollution.
In the case where the neighbor owns the pollution rights;
Q = 1 − (P + c)
c is marginal cost of production, P is price for pollution permit, Q is marginal
cost function for the manufacturer in the case. Neighbor has valuation ν for clean
environment, and the sale of Q pollution permits entails a loss of νQ = ν(1 − (P + c)),
so the neighbor finds the price of pollution permits by maximizing net benefit
max{(1 − (P + c))P − ν(1 − (P + c))}
P

The benefit maximization is
1 − 2P − c + ν = 0
Giving the price
P =

1−c+ν
2

Q=

1−c−ν
2

and the units bought by the factory

26

If the factory has the entire property right, the neighbor effectively purchases some
share of the pollution right from the factory which it doesn’t use. The neighbor wants
to buy Q = 1 − (P − ν) units. The factory maximizes its net benefit with
max{(1 − (P − ν))P − c(1 − (P − nu))}
P

The factory’s profit maximization is
1 − 2P + ν − c = 0
So the price is still

1−c+ν
2
For Coase’s theorem to hold symmetrically, it requires well-defined property rights.
By definition, the user’s attention is the valued quantity. The user can make the decision
to block ads from a given publisher, or choose to forgo interacting with a publisher
altogether.
This makes it obvious that attention belongs to users de facto and notwithstanding
the efforts of some publishers and advertising firms to assert ownership of user attention
de jure. Even in commonplace situations where user attention is de jure required, de
facto, users still own their own attention. For example, attention is required while the
safety demonstration is given on an airline flight, but people often ignore it anyway.
Another requirement for validity of the symmetric version of Coase’s theorem is
information symmetry. Information asymmetry between publishers, advertisers and
users has kept the existing advertising ecosystem in place for some time, but as we can
see from the growing use of ad-blockers, the information asymmetries on the user side
are crumbling.
At present, advertisers and publishers have a severe information asymmetry in that
most of the metrics they use to assess campaign effectiveness are indirect and administered by middlemen whose interests are not aligned with the interests of one or both
parties. Complex “viewability” metrics create unnecessary conflict between advertisers
and publishers. There is no technical reason for this information asymmetry; it can
be mitigated with better technology, in particular browser technology at the endpoint
where all the data can be measured privately and confirmed anonymously.
The final requirement, which is only a soft requirement for Coasean analysis in
the case of well-defined property rights, is that of low transaction costs. The Coasean
transaction cost refers to the cost of negotiating a deal which can suit all parties to a
dispute involving social costs. With the existing ecosystem, the transaction costs are
impossibly high, with advertisers, publishers and users unable to come to terms.
In our example of present-day ad networks, we have a potential Coasean bargain
between publishers and users, with a better outcome for advertisers as well. A Coasean
solution to the attention economy inefficiencies for publishers and users is for advertisers
to pay publishers by actual attention given to the publisher by the user.
Advertisers will pay the publisher for a share of the valuable attention the user pays
to the publisher. Readers also will be directly compensated for their valued attention.
P =

27

Figure 13: BAT Digital Ad Flow

The “pollution” of privacy invasiveness, slow browsing and data costs can be almost
completely mitigated. Advertisers will know if their messages are delivered without having to resort to complex arguments about “viewability.” Publishers will not experience
the negative externalities from the growing problem of ad blocker adoption.
Various proxies have been developed by advertisers and publishers to attempt to
measure user attention using indirect techniques of “viewability,” but the advent of adblocking technologies and the increasing problem of fraud from non-human entities have
cast doubt on such methods. A more direct technique would be to pay publishers via
cryptographically secure methods, and serve the ad directly in the browser. Since the
browser ultimately measures how the user interacts with the website better than any
indirect meddling by intermediaries, involving the browser software itself in the process
provides accurate measures of user attention bestowed on the publisher and advertiser.
The browser also provides a much richer data set for understanding what the individual user is interested in. The Brave browser will contain opt-in and transparent
machine learning algorithms for assessing user interests. While an ad campaign targeted
to a financial publisher may have value to the broad interests of the overall readership
of the publisher, individual readers can be given ads tailored to their individual and
even private preferences.
For example, sending an ad for discount bond brokers to people who are following the
markets in municipal bond issues. The user who is reading about tech stocks and who
has no interest in municipal bonds won’t receive the ad. The advertiser will effectively
target the precise microsegment they are interested in reaching. The user receives more
relevant ads while interest lasts, and private interests are not revealed to publishers or
advertisers.
The idea that user attention should have monetary value is familiar to both publish28

ers and advertisers. The idea of publishers and particularly users being paid directly
for attention bestowed on the publisher is novel. Since the valuable commodity is user
attention, it makes economic sense that the user be compensated for their attention.
One could justify this as a compensation for the externalities imposed on users by the
advertising ecosystem. One could also justify this by the fact that one is more likely
to perform an action if one is compensated for it. There is also confirmation that the
actual user attention is bestowed on the publisher via the addition of cryptographic
contracts built on blockchain to this advertising stack. The code is open source and can
be reviewed by researchers and interested parties on the advertiser and publisher sides.
Since the transactions for the first deployment of BAT will happen through the Brave
Ledger, which has privacy and deterministic user anonymity by design, full transparency
can be achieved while user privacy is maintained. While this centralized solution should
fulfill economic and technical goals, for further iterations, a decentralized solution could
be developed to allow for trustless auditable transactions.
While paying a user to look at a publisher content may seem heretical to advertisers,
the reality is the advertiser is paying someone. Removing the vast field of middlemen
who add no value to the user/publisher relationship allows for a situation where the
user may be compensated for valuable attention (made more valuable and relevant by
measures of user interest at the browser) with no impact to advertiser costs and positive
impact to publisher revenues. From a financial point of view, this could be seen as a
variation on some other kind of short term promotion: advertisers regularly provide
coupons and rebates on products. Promotions do not solve the problem of informing
the user of the advertiser’s product in the first place. Promotions also don’t induce user
loyalty or engagement. Most CMOs agree that short term sales can be improved with
promotions, but sustainable competitive advantage can’t be achieved using promotions,
hence the use of advertisements.

7.2

A Three-Way Coasean Bargain

The three-way Coase theorem is a source of much research interest among economists.
The existence of “empty cores” in some situations have called into question the applicability of the Coase theorem to real world examples involving multiple distinct players[26]. While there are many more than three participants in the online ad market, we
can idealize them as consisting of three participants: the advertiser, the publisher and
the user. This analysis is useful for understanding the game theoretic considerations,
for addressing any “empty core” arguments against the proposed Coasean bargain, as
well as for illustrating the dire state of the publishing industry.
We propose the Basic Attention Token (BAT), a cryptographically-secure token,
as the medium of exchange for facilitating this Coasean bargain while protecting the
privacy of the user.
The advertiser wants to purchase user attention. This is broadly analogous to the
“cost of production” in the exposition of the Coase theorem above, whose notation we
follow.
The advertiser values the user attention with price Caa . The publisher wishes to
29

monetize the attention Cap paid to the website. The user who views the website values
the content of the website with attention Cac .
Advertisers and publishers in the present ecosystem have transaction costs associated
with monetization of attention. Publishers are paid by advertisers to provide user
attention. The intermediaries of the present system create costs therefore Cap < Caa .
Note, when we talk about “transaction costs” apropos the Coase theorem, we refer
to the transaction costs for negotiating a deal between the players of the Coasean game,
therefore, rather awkwardly, the monetary costs of getting the ad to the publisher is
not considered a “transaction cost” per se.
The present advertising ecosystem produces “social costs” or attention pollution as
we have discussed above. These social costs are known to be large. For some large
fraction of users (22% Lumascape state of the ad industry), the social costs are larger
than the attention cost. We will label the pollution cost following the above example as
Pac . In the present situation, the user will view the publisher and advertisers content so
long as Cac > Pac . Every user is different, and of course, the publishers and advertisers
vary as well, but the existence and growth of a large population of users for whom
Cac < Pac indicates that we are approaching the time where this inequality is always
violated. The consequences of this are that Cap = 0 ⇐⇒ (Cac < Pac )
Since Cac is proportional to Publisher profit (and advertiser profit in “attention”), any
value which keeps Cac > Pac is advantageous to the Publisher and Advertiser. Effectively
the advertiser and the publisher combined are the factory in this argument, and the user
owns the pollution rights. However, the user also values the product of the publisher. In
the degenerate case where Cac < Pac the user is also eventually harmed as the attention
economy collapses, and the user takes up other hobbies.
The social cost should be decomposed into its constituent parts. We have identified
the primary components of the social cost in our exposition of the advertising industry
above. Security risk is one component, P s . Hacker networks can place ads in irresponsible ad exchanges, which could have very large costs for individual users as well as the
publisher who displays those ads.
Privacy loss is a very important social cost associated with the advertising landscape
as it presently exists, P p . Privacy invasions are presently required by advertisers to make
sure the advertisement is actually viewed by a relevant user. In effect, the advertisers
are paying for something which adds value to the attention.
Data costs are also a significant part of the social cost of the present day advertising
ecosystem P d . These costs are often borne by the user as a result of the activities of
the middlemen who serve the advertiser and publisher. These costs seem most trivial,
but for many users, they are among the top causes driving ad blocker adoption. For all
viewers of online ad funded content, considerable time is taken in dealing with the cost
of downloading and executing all the privacy-violating code. In addition to this cost,
for those users who are using mobile devices, the monetary charges can be significant.
It has been estimated that the top 50 news sites make 16 times less than the actual
charges in data costs of delivering the advertising to the mobile user of these ads9! Since
half or more of the data delivered by the publisher is advertising-related, half of a data
plan can be hundreds of dollars a year in direct costs to the mobile user.
30

Figure 14: Top Reasons to Block Ads: User Experience and Privacy

Finally, there is the cost to attention produced by the ad itself, P a . In most cases,
this is not a large cost, but as it is the thing actually valued most by advertisers, it
should be accounted for separately. If ads can be made relevant, P a may even be
negative. Some users like looking at certain ads.
So, our total social cost for the present online ad ecosystem is
Pac = P a + P d + P p + P s
For a given value of P a which is the thing actually valued by the advertiser, Pac will
always be lower if we can eliminate the other factors. A token-based system with
anonymizing features would remove P p entirely. P d will not be entirely mitigated by
a token system, as some network traffic will take place to service the system and to
present the ad itself. Since only a few bytes of data will need to be transferred to
service the token, this cost will effectively only be in the downloading of the content
of the advertisement; a considerable improvement. The use of cryptographic protocols
and Zero Knowledge Proofs, as well as the use of known publishers and advertisers will
also lower P s considerably.
So, for a properly privacy protecting token system:
d
s
Pac (BAT) = P a + PBAT
+ PBAT

To first order approximation,
d
Pac (BAT) = P a + PBAT

The remaining social cost can be reduced or eliminated by paying the user compensation which can be used for other things (for example, paying a publisher for premium
31

content or apps which relate to the content). In the simplified game-theoretic case presented here, the publisher eventually recovers this fraction of the ad spend anyway, since
the publisher is the only place the attention token can be spent. In a more extensive
case where the user can spend the tokens at other publishers, the revenues taken by the
publisher are bounded by the ratio of the user’s take. The way tokens are apportioned
in an advertising event in the proposed scheme, the publisher receives advertising spend
that is much larger than the proposition of advertising spend they currently receive.
As the user also receives something which is of utility to him, we can safely declare
that Pac (BAT) is zero or negative, which should encourage users to view more publisher
content. Some may object that the token acquired by users for their attention activity
can only be spent in the publisher’s “company store,” but as the token may be saved
and used in different ways, it does have value to the user, just as airline points and
video game tokens do.
The advertiser’s spending for a given amount of attention should be smaller in this
ecosystem, since there are fewer social costs associated with delivering the required attention. In addition, the advertiser doesn’t ever have to pay for social cost to middlemen
to achieve confidence their advertising content was shipped to a relevant user. Since
this situation is better for publishers, and makes for happier and more “productive”
users, advertisers should receive more benefit for their advertising spend.
To summarize, we have used the Coase theorem to demonstrate that the use of
the BAT system offers lower costs to browser users, advertisers and publishers in the
attention economy. Advertisers will receive a superior share of user attention, along with
superior proof of user engagement. Publishers will receive a larger share of advertising
revenues. Users will receive a superior experience with relevant ads and a share of
advertising revenues.

7.3

An Analysis of the Stability of the BAT

A model for virtual currency exchange rates was postulated by Dutch economists von
Oordt and Bolt in 2016[27]. The model postulates that the value of virtual currencies
consists of three major factors; the utility of the virtual currency to make payments, the
decision of forward-looking speculators to regulate the supply of virtual currency, and
the elements that drive user adoption and merchant acceptance of a virtual currency.
The argument originates with Fisher’s 1911 observation that speculators may effectively limit the money supply by withdrawing money from circulation in anticipation
of higher future utility. Since this dynamic particularly applies to limited issuance currencies such as bitcoin or BAT, it can be an important factor in the pricing for token
sales and stability analysis of virtual currencies.
For a simple economic system with fixed quantity of currency tokens M BAT , we can
write down a transaction quantity relationship:
PtBAT TtBAT = M BAT VtBAT
Where VtBAT is velocity of BAT, the average number of times each unit of BAT is
used to purchase services within the defined period of time t. TtBAT is the quantity of
32

services purchased with BAT over the period of time t and PtBAT is the weighted price
of the services.
Inserting the exchange rate in terms of $
PtBAT BAT
Tt
= M BAT VtBAT
Pt$
Since we can assume the legacy fiat currency is the accounting unit for all parties
$

involved, we define the exchange rate StBAT , and substitute in the above equation to
give
$

StBAT =

TtBAT
M BAT VtBAT

If we consider the fraction of currency which is not used in transfer of services, we
can postulate a velocity of the fraction of currency which is actually used for settlement
BAT . Defining Z BAT to be the number of BAT units not used in transactions.
Vd
t
t
Since the entire velocity of money in our economy VtBAT is an average between the
currency units used and the units unused for transfer of services,
VtBAT =

M BAT − ZtBAT d
VtBAT
M BAT

Combining these into the exchange rate
BAT
Td
t

$

StBAT =

(1)

BAT
(M BAT − ZtBAT )Vd
t

The exchange rate for BAT tokens is therefore proportional to the volume of services
purchased and inversely proportional to the currency not used in transactions for the
time period t. This equation encapsulates the insight that a lack of money in circulation
will raise the exchange rate.
We now turn our attention to the fraction of BAT which is not used for exchange.
Some of the ZtBAT tokens may be the result of users forgetting about the small number
of tokens they hold. Some may be due to exchange delays in settlement for legacy currencies. Overall though, the holders of inactive tokens have standard ways of evaluating
future utility of the tokens in terms of modern risk management theory.
Since tokens do not bear interest, there is a discounted term associated with holding
a position of size ztBAT in them.
$

−RS BAT ztBAT
where R is the interest rate discounting in the legacy currency.
If we consider the future expected value of the BAT holdings as the sum of the
future expected value of the position in BAT
$

||S BAT t + 1||ztBAT
33

with this discounted interest rate term (where R is the discounting operator), and
the volatility of the future position in BAT scaled by a risk aversion term γ, we reach
the efficient frontier from modern portfolio theory.
$

$

$

BAT
BAT
||St+1
||ztBAT − R(StBAT )ztBAT + γσ 2 (||St+1
||)ztBAT = 0

Using this standard result, we can solve for the optimal number of tokens held by
an individual during a given time period.
$

$

ztBAT

=

BAT
|| − R(StBAT )
||St+1
$
BAT
||)
γσ 2 (||St+1

If we consider all of the people holding BAT at a given time interval t we get the
economically efficient number of BAT held for later use.
$

ZtBAT = Nt ztBAT =

$

BAT
||St+1
||ztBAT − R(StBAT )
$

γ 2
BAT
Nt σ (||St+1 ||)

Since this value can’t be negative, we assume that people who hold BAT have the
position that
$

$

BAT
||St+1
|| ≥ R(StBAT )

hence, using our above relationship, we get the relationship between the expected
future value of the BAT, the interest rate and the velocity of transfers in the BAT
economy:
TtBAT
M BAT VtBAT
So, people hold BAT if the discounted expected value exceeds the hypothetical value
of the current exchange rate. So, the exchange rate as a function of future expected
value of BAT is
$

BAT
R−1 (||St+1
||) ≥

$
γ BAT 2
BAT
Zt σ (||St+1
||))
(2)
Nt
Thus, the BAT holdings are the discounted expected future exchange rate minus
the risk premium for the uncertainty in future value of the BAT.
If the model holds, 1 and 2 can be used to define supply and demand for BAT. Since
M BAT is not time dependent in the case of BAT, the time varying exchange rate can
be readily understood in terms of BAT transactions and opinions on future utility of
BAT transactions. As BAT transactions increase, the exchange rate becomes dominated
by the transactions rather than future expectations of utility. This dynamic has been
observed in maturing virtual currencies as well as various other in-house token systems.
While models are imprecise, this model argues for long term price stability in a
token mediated economy.

Project Outline
Mission

The mission of the Bitland Project is to register land and real property ownership and use rights
in a secure, easily-accessible electronic format to allow for timely access of ownership and rights
information, and to educate people on the importance of strong property rights in the prosperity
of the nation.
Company Profile

Bitland Global is an organization that digitizes land titles. The larger goal is to have all
the transactions recorded onto a distributed ledger using block-chain technology. The company
is a non-profit organization that is working to keep the land registration process accessible,
transparent, and free from government corruption. Bitland is located in Kumasi, Ghana, and is
looking to expand operations into other countries in the African continent within the next few
years.
As the company works to update paper data storage houses into digital format, it must
also consolidate new land registry requests against the old registries. In many cases, the official
documents are outdated, and the locals have their own systems for keeping track of titles. In
order to get a single registry that represents a consistent ledger of land title holdings, all of these
problems must be solved, and in the process the integrity of the central registry must be kept.
The Bitland team serves as the liaisons between the people needing to register land titles, and the
officials that currently hold the access to the physical databases.

In order to effectively work through digitizing the backlogs while continuing to take in
new registry requests, it will be important that the Bitland team establishes a work group that
includes a representative from the government security team, and also from the community legal
team. The Bitland Liaison will act as the representative to relay information and data between
Bitland, the government official, and the local representative.
While the Bitland liaison does not report directly to the CSO within the Bitland
organization, the CSO is still responsible for making sure that the liaison follows the policies and
procedures of the Land Administration Project. The CSO will communicate with the Chief
Operating Officer to coordinate the activities of the liaisons. These policies and procedures are
the requirements necessary to ensure all of the land registrations are up to code and legal. The
CSO must oversee daily operations of the database management and active security threats, so
the direct reporting to the CSO is mainly the daily security briefings and activity.
In order to properly ensure communication between the working group within Bitland
and the external liaisons, a very direct communication system must be developed (Security
Program Best Practices, 2013). Having a working group communication hierarchy will ensure
that the projects goals are reached, and the responsibilities within the organization are clearly
defined and followed.

Security Requirements
Since there are many active threats and risks within the digital and real-world elements
of this process, having a multi-faceted approach to security is crucial. This includes access
control, encrypted data relay, incident response plans, incident response teams, system backups, solar power generators, and a dedicated private network. Since the company is working in
areas where the infrastructure needs to be developed, it cannot rely on a local area network for
data relay.
It will be necessary for the team to establish Bitland centers that house the hardware to
support the Bitland network. In the pilot project, the team is looking to establish the first
centers among twenty-eight communities around Ghana. The first phase of the project will be
getting the communities to get their current titles up to date and any new areas surveyed. It will
be imperative that the communities have unbroken access to the Bitland network, and local ISPs
or electric companies are not reliable enough to ensure 24/7 access. In the case that the first
phase of the project is successful, the team will look to establish more Bitland centers around
Ghana to expand the network. The team has developed a four year implementation plan that
looks to start with a local wi-fi network for the pilot communities, then establish metropolitan
access networks which would give greater Ghana constant access to the Bitland network.

Security Management

Cadastrals

Bitland Global llc. will be issuing digital tokens called Cadastrals. The Bitland team is
currently in the process of establishing a blockchain based ecosystem in Ghana for which
Cadastrals will be the entry token. As the Bitland team develops the ecosystem, individuals
who have obtained Cadastrals will be able to use them to invest in the local economy and see
real returns on their investment, as the team is establishing a system which will allow smart
bonds and smart contracts to be created and utilized by governments, communities,
organizations, and individuals. This system will open up new avenues for foreign investment
into the region, while also establishing a transparent system in which these smart investments
can take place without fear of corruption or nepotism.

To get through the first year of operations, the team has allotted 20 million Cadastrals to
be used in an ICO to establish the first operational Bitland Center. The ICO will be hosted by
the Crypto Currency Exchange Denmark, and the funds will be held in escrow on the
Openledger platform. In the process, Bitland would be establishing its own private network for
the locals that would be faster and more reliable than what they currently have.
As the Bitland team registers the communities to start registering their land titles, the system
will utilize a third party Oracle to validate the smart contracts. 3 Million Cadastrals will be
allocated to be paid out in block rewards over the next 99 years. 2 Million tokens will be
allocated to pay for Bitland Employees and independent contractors over 12 months of
operations.

Security Management

1 Million tokens will be sold through direct sales to establish a multi-currency reserve
for the token. The reserve will hold funds in Bitcoin, US Dollars, Ghanaian Cedi, Yen, Euro,
and will aim to accept the currency of any future country in which Bitland operates. 4 Million
tokens will be set aside to sell directly to governments as the entry tokens to list contracts.
Governments will utilize the Bitland GUI to list contracts and create requests for bids
that can then be listed for a contractor to claim. The Bitland System will utilize a double-blind
bidding system so that the Government does not know who is bidding for the contract, and the
bidder does not know the specific region of the contract or the owner of the contract. This will
be to keep the process from being corrupted through nepotism, inflated bidding, or funds going
to only a specific region.

The team uses a combination of decentralized data storage and traditional server
warehouses for back-ups. The first iteration of this project uses MIT Graphene encryption for
any data that is being transmitted across the network or stored. The system also runs regular
integrity checks to ensure there have been no changes to data. This is crucial for ensuring the
land titles are not registered to more than one owner. It also prevents any person or official
from modifying it without taking direct responsibility. This will prevent any fraudulent
activities, and any official working against the interest of the government for personal gain will
be exposed through digital footprints.

Security Business Requirements
CMMIWhen defining the hierarchy of policy and procedure decision-making and
implementation, the Capability Maturity Model Integration is a useful method of analyzing an
organization’s state. The CMMI allows a company to objectively rate the readiness of its
individual departments to improve the process flow. The three different types of CMMI models
include models for Development, for Services, and for Acquisition (Greiner, 2007). As well as
having different types of CMMI models, there are different capability levels that define the
readiness of each process area. These levels start at zero, and go to level three. In order they
are:
Incomplete: This is a process that is incomplete for any reason. At least one of the goals of the
process area is not complete.
Performed: At this level, the process has been completed, and the goals of the process area of
been met.
Managed: At this level, the care is taken to make sure that the processes are monitored and any
policies that need to be adhered to are known and followed. This level is important to make
sure that policies and procedures are implemented top-down with consistency and integrity.
Defined: In stage three, the policies and procedures are well-known and established. Standards
of practices are consistent company-wide, and processes are defined in more detail.
There are five levels of process maturity that are identified by the CMMI (Greiner,
2007).

Security Management

Initial: This is the first phase or starting point for any new process.
Repeatable: This is the level for a process that is used repeatedly.
Defined: This is when the process has become officially defined as a standard business process.
Managed: This is the level at which process measurement and management occur.
Optimizing: This is the level at which analysis of the prior levels is implemented into
optimization of a process.
Within the CMMI paradigm, there are Key Process Areas that are used to further
elaborate on the five levels that have already been defined (Greiner, 2007).
1. Goals
2. Commitment
3. Ability
4. Measurement
5. Verification

For this project, the model that makes the most sense is the Development model. The
Development model for CMMI encompasses all activities that constitute the actual delivery of a
product or service. Within this model, the Process Area that should be the focus is
Requirements Management (REQM). REQM is the method of obtaining all the requirements of
the project to have an informed base of knowledge for planning, development, testing, and
delivery. In the process of implementing the REQM, creating a transparent and centralized
system to track system changes will simplify the monitoring process. As the system to track
and document the REQM is developed, it will use a decentralized block-chain based approach

Security Management

to keeping track of the records. This will mitigate risk of file tampering and also lower the
costs associated with data storage and data processing power.
It will be necessary to focus on the REQM process area, as this process area will be the
foundation of the organization’s service delivery. Establishing a system that is built with a
focus on transparency, data integrity, and monitoring lays the foundation for Bitland’s final
product to make it easy for users to follow protocol. The generic practice that will be utilized is
to establish organizational policies. Establishing organizational policies ensures that a standard
method of approaching situations makes processes most efficient, and keeps all parties involved
operating within all necessary parameters.
The specific practices necessary for Bitland to have long term success will include
practices to ensure that users protect their respective data. A practice that will aide in this
process is to utilize hardware based access controls for executing important operations. To
prevent malicious agents from impersonating users through either man in the middle attacks,
proxy spoofing, or other brute force methods, a hardware access control will allow multifactor
authentication to be utilized.
The biggest goal of developing the REQM area is to establish the backbone of the
Bitland system. This backbone includes a monitoring system that collects, stores, and publicly
displays data. The first stage of the process will utilize the system to monitor progress of
company-wide policy and procedure implementation. From there, the system will become the
actual infrastructure for the Bitland organization’s business operations.

System Design Principles
To establish the integrity of the Information Security Architecture, it will be imperative
to have a set of core principles that drive the continuous hardening of security. While there will
be many principles that shape the security strategies, the following five principles will be the
most important to keep constantly at the core of development.
1 – Secure the Weakest Link:
In the process of establishing levels of security, the adage goes “a chain is only as strong
as its weakest link”. To ensure that the culture of the organization revolves around security, it
will be important that every level from Government official to individual user understands the
importance of maintaining secure channels, policies, and procedures. It only takes one breach
point to open up a system to malicious attack, so all parties accessing the network should have
proper information and training that focuses on staying secure (McGraw, 2013).
2 – Defend in Depth:
It is never good to rely on one layer as the end-all layer of security. Whether it is having
multiple firewalls, multi-factor authentication, or biometric keys, the system should have
multiple layers of security anticipating at least one will fail, and in worst case scenario multiple
layers could fail. That will tie into the next principle of “failing securely” (McGraw, 2013).
3 – Fail Securely:
No system will ever be 100% impervious to malicious attacks. It will be important to
establish this so when system failures do happen, the contingency plans have mitigated most of

Security Management

the risks, and the resulting impact to data is minimal to non-existent. Having the redundancies
in the layers helps reduce the risks of failure causing enough damage to impede operations
(McGraw, 2013).
4 – Grant Least Privilege:
To reduce risk of breaches affecting sensitive information, user access should be limited
whenever possible. This adds a layer of security by limiting the penetration capacity of the
breach point. Government officials may need to have access to more files than regular users,
but this does not mean the officials won’t have some restrictions on access. It will be extremely
imperative to monitor access control, and ensure that the privileges are strictly given out on a
necessary basis (McGraw, 2013).
5 – Separate Privileges:
This follows on the heels of the previous principle. It makes the process of granting
privileges much easier to control if specific domains of control are separated. For example,
everyone does not need to access the company’s website to make changes. Privileges for
something like this should be given to only those needing to make changes. Users and the
proper government officials should be the only parties able to make changes or documentation
of land titles. Making sure that the government officials who need access to titles is closely
monitored will be necessary as well to ensure access control does not become a point of breach
(McGraw, 2013).

Security Training Module
To ensure that the security principles are established through policy and procedure, the
Bitland team will establish workshops for members of the organization, the government, and for
the local community. Having the workshops that cover all the areas of security and
organizational hierarchy will be imperative to establish a culture of integrity across the entire
project. Everyone involved should be educated and informed so that their decision-making
processes are not creating unnecessary risks. The following team members will be leading the
different sessions.

CHRONOBANK - PHASE 1: A NON-VOLATILE DIGITAL TOKEN BACKED BY
LABOUR-HOURS

THE CHRONOBANK TEAM
CHRONOBANK.IO
INFO@CHRONOBANK.IO

Abstract. This whitepaper abstractly describes a system designed to tokenise labour-hours using blockchain
technology. ChronoBank is a proposed implementation of the described system that can be deployed in several
economic localities. The proposed system leverages smart contract techniques to automate a process whereby
a country-specific ‘labour-hour’ token may be redeemed for real labour-hours via legally binding (traditional)
contracts with labour-offering companies. The proposed ‘stable-coin’ implementation provides a non-volatile,
inflation-resistant digital asset transfer system.

1. Introduction

centralises the entire wealth of the system. Typical stablecoins are also subject to fluctuations in the value of their
underlying asset. While these fluctuations are usually very
small when compared with fluctuations in traditional cryptocurrencies, they are still significant. For example, USDT
is subject to the devaluation of USD due to inflation.
In this paper, we propose a stable cryptocurrency system which addresses the aforementioned drawbacks of
existing stable currency solutions. Specifically, we propose
a new type of token which is not backed by any existing
fiat currency or physical store of wealth, but instead is
backed by legally binding contractual obligations to provide real-world labour-hours. As such, the system and its
controlling entity are not responsible for the centralised
storage and management of wealth. Further, the value of
an unskilled labour-hour in a particular geographic region
naturally adjusts according to economic conditions such
as inflation, thereby maintaining the long-term intrinsic
value of the cryptocurrency.
This paper is organised as follows: In Section 2 we provide an overview of the system as a whole before discussing
the technical details of the necessary system components
and processes. Section 3 provides economic considerations
in brief, regarding the real-world deployment of this system
and its feasibility. Finally, Section 4 discusses future directions and applications of the system and of ChronoBank.
The appendix of this document provides supporting reference of several concepts introduced throughout the paper.
In particular Appendix B and C list the variables that encapsulate the functionality of the system. These variables
are also summarised in Table 1.

With the advent of cryptocurrencies, relatively instant low-cost transfers of value have become a reality.
Blockchain technology, which is a defining feature of most
cryptocurrencies, has recently been applied to solve a great
variety of problems. Currently the most widespread implementation of blockchain technology is Bitcoin [1], which is
a simple asset transfer system. The asset in Bitcoin’s case
is a bitcoin (BTC). The value of this token has seen rapid
variation since its inception in 2009, which has hindered
its feasibility as a global currency.
There have been a variety of attempts to realise the
advantages of blockchain technology while simultaneously
mitigating issues regarding the stability of value for cryptocurrency applications. To achieve this, many attempts
employ the notion of a stable-coin, whereby each token of
value in the system has a counterpart of equal worth stored
in a non-digital and tangible form in the ‘real world’.
Two example implementations of the aforementioned
stable-coin paradigm are listed below:
USDT by Tether[2]:
Each USDT token is backed by an equivalent
amount of United States Dollars (USD) held in
a reserve account by the private company Tether
Limited.
Digix[3]:
Each token is backed by an equivalent amount of
gold, which is stored in reserves by a dedicated
precious metal storage custodian.
In both examples, it is always possible for a token holder
to redeem that token for its counterpart, thus ensuring its
fundamental ‘stable’ value.
Another notable example of a stable-coin is Bitshares [4],
which attempts to decentralise the entire system through
the use of digital Contract For Differences (CFD) [5] interactions. The system presented in this whitepaper does not
attempt to achieve decentralisation, but instead attempts
to address some of the drawbacks surrounding existing
centralised stable-coins. These drawbacks include difficulties regarding the storage of physical or economic wealth,
and the increasing likelihood of attacks, as a single entity

2. The ChronoBank System
Similar to existing stable-coins (such as USDT by Tether
and Digix), we propose a centralised entity that coordinates
the creation, redemption, and destruction of Labour-Hour
Tokens (LHT). We refer to this entity as the ChronoBank
Entity (CBE). It is responsible for the acquisition and
coordination of legally binding contracts for labour, in
addition to the creation and dissemination of LHT. Ultimately the role of the CBE is to ensure the stability

CBE refers to the ChronoBank Entity, LOC to Labour-Offering Companies, LHT to Labour-Hour Tokens and TIME to

of the LHT system through careful management of the
system’s underlying processes. This section will provide
details describing the proposed processes, practices, and
operations undertaken by the CBE and its associates. An
overview of the functionality of the ChronoBank system’s
constituents is shown in Figure 1.
The system as a whole is designed with the intent of a
single deployment per economic region. For instance, the
system could be deployed once in Australia using the value
of one labour-hour in the Australian economy, measured in
Australian dollars. As this document is an abstract description of the system, it does not refer to any region-specific
implementation but instead refers to generalised system
parameters that must be tailored for each region. With few
exceptions, all processes and structures described in this
document may have slight variations in implementation
between regions in which ChronoBank operates.
The initial implementation of the CBE will utilise the
Ethereum[6] blockchain; however, future implementations
may tokenise assets on alternative blockchain systems (e.g.
Waves [7], Bitcoin [1]) when it is deemed appropriate.
The CBE provides economic benefit both to the environment in which it is deployed, and to a group of stakeholders
that assist the CBE by providing initial operating capital.
Unlike the region-specific deployment of the CBE system,
only one group of CBE stakeholders (a.k.a. TIME token
holders) exists globally. These stakeholders provide initial
operating capital to the CBE in the form of both fiat and
cryptocurrencies, in exchange for a portion of future profits
attained by the CBE.

2.1. Stakeholders & TIME Tokens
In order to fund the development and operation of the
ChronoBank system, there will be a fundraising phase
known as the crowdsale. During the crowdsale, individuals

may purchase TIME tokens at a fixed rate, which provides
the token holder with the right to receive a proportion of
the profits arising from the operation of the system. In
addition to the entitlements regarding the system’s operating profit, holders of TIME tokens will also be granted
the right to vote on important decisions regarding the
ChronoBank system.
TIME tokens will be developed utilising the Ethereum
ecosystem, specifically leveraging the ERC20 token
standard[8]. The ERC20 specification will be extended to
provide voting functionality and rewards distribution; this
is discussed further in Sections 2.1.3 and 2.1.2 below.
2.1.1. Crowdsale
During the crowdsale, TIME tokens will be created as
necessary and sold at the fixed price of 100 TIME tokens
for 1 bitcoin (BTC). There is no limit to the number of
TIME tokens generated during the crowdsale; however, no
further TIME tokens will be generated after this phase of
the project.

throughout this paper for reader’s reference. See the Appendix for further details.

CHRONOBANK - PHASE 1: A NON-VOLATILE DIGITAL TOKEN BACKED BY LABOUR-HOURS

All TIME tokens purchased during the crowdsale will
constitute 88% of the total TIME tokens generated during the initialisation of the ChronoBank system. The
remaining 12% of tokens will be split with 10% given to
the ChronoBank.io team (for ongoing research and development) and 2% to advisors and early adopters of the
system.

Figure 2. Issuance fees (fi ) and transaction fees (ft ) are
deposited into the rewards contract. TIME holders can
withdraw a portion of the LHT after each snapshot, if their
TIME tokens were deposited into the contract.
2.1.2. TIME Token Rewards
For the use of the LHT, users will be charged a fixed
fee, ft = 0.15% on all transactions. Complementary to
transaction fees, issuance fees (fi ) will be taken during
the minting process (further details in Section 2.2.1). The
issuance fees will start at 3% during the first year of operation and will stepwise decrease by 1% each year until a
final issuance fee of 1% is achieved and maintained.
Both the transaction and issuance fees will be automatically collected and sent to a rewards contract on the
Ethereum blockchain as shown in Figure 2. The rewards
contract is designed such that TIME token holders can
withdraw their earned rewards in a manner that makes
them non-unique (i.e. withdrawal of rewards is not tracked
on a per-token basis) and hence tradeable on exchanges
for equal value.
The rewards contract will allow TIME token holders to
retrieve their rewards at regular payout intervals, P . At
any given stage, TIME holders may deposit their tokens
into the rewards contract. At the onset of a payout interval, a snapshot of deposited TIME tokens and the current
contract reward balance will be taken1. The rewards will
be divided equally among the TIME tokens that were deposited at the time of the snapshot. Depositors may then
withdraw their share of rewards during the following payout interval. At the next payout snapshot, any unclaimed
rewards will be forfeited and added to the total balance of
that snapshot. Figure 3 illustrates this concept by plotting
the rewards contract balance over time. We also note that
we expect P to be of the order of a few months.
TIME holders may deposit and withdraw their TIME
tokens at any stage, however only TIME holders who have
deposited before the snapshot of each payout interval can

3

claim rewards. Withdrawing TIME tokens from the contract will also withdraw any rewards currently owed to
the depositor. TIME holders may also leave their tokens
deposited in the rewards contract indefinitely and claim
their rewards periodically.

Figure 3. The rewards contract receives Pr rewards for
every payout interval P (in our example, we assume that
Pr is constant). At each snapshot, the portion of rewards
that are not withdrawn is d. Rewards that are not withdrawn roll over to the following payout interval P . The
dashed line indicates the withdrawable balance, which reduce over each payout interval as TIME holders withdraw
their rewards.
This reward payout system gives upper bounds to the
amount of rewards that can be stored in the contract in any
interval, under some reasonable assumptions. The total
rewards obtained via fees for a particular payout interval,
P , is Pr . If we assume a constant amount of transaction
and issuance fees per payout interval (i.e. a constant Pr ),
and an average percentage of locked TIME holders that do
not withdraw in any payout interval, d, we can calculate
the upper bound of the LHT stored in the smart contract
through the limiting geometric series relation2:
∞
X

Pr dk = Pr (1 − d)−1 .

(1)

k=0

To clarify this, let us take a conservative estimate, that
90% of all locked TIME token holders do not withdraw
their rewards in every payout interval (only 10% actually
withdraw). In this scenario, no more than 10Pr worth
of rewards will be stored in the rewards contract at any
given time. A less conservative estimate, being 50% of
locked TIME holders withdrawing each payout interval,
will ensure the rewards contract never contains more than
2Pr worth of rewards. Through the careful (and potentially dynamic) choice of P we can find a balance between
practicality (frequency of reward withdrawal) and security
(safe level of stored value in a smart contract).
2.1.3. TIME Voting
From time to time, the CBE may hold polls on the
Ethereum blockchain to elicit the opinion of TIME token
holders. Poll results will be incorporated into decisions
made by the CBE concerning the financial or technical

1The transaction for which may be initiated by anyone, but typically by the CBE.
2Assuming 0 ≤ d < 1.

CHRONOBANK - PHASE 1: A NON-VOLATILE DIGITAL TOKEN BACKED BY LABOUR-HOURS

direction and/or implementation of the CBE system. Only
valid TIME holders are considered current stakeholders in
the CBE system and are the only parties authorised to
participate in a poll.

2.2. Labour-Hour Tokens
Labour-Hour Tokens (LHT) are the fundamental unit
of value within the ChronoBank system. The purpose
of these tokens is to provide a non-volatile, inflationaryresistant digital store of value on various blockchains. We
envisage these tokens for utilisation in future systems, such
as LaborX (see Section 4 for a brief overview).
A Labour-Hour Token will be derived from a standard
Ethereum ERC20 token and will be tradeable on all major
exchanges. The ChronoBank system will ensure that these
tokens will always have a 1 to 1 mapping with legally bound
promises of labour-hours from various Labour-Offering
Companies (LOC). As such, token holders may also redeem these tokens at any given time for their real-world
labour-hour counterpart. This section details the various
processes required to feasibly sustain the 1 to 1 mapping
of LHT to offered labour-hours and ensure the economic
stability of the ChronoBank system.

• S - A portion to be sent to the Security Guarantee
Fund (SGF) (see Section 2.3.2).
• LT - The total portion sent to the Liquidity Reserve (Section 2.3.1). This fund is further split by
a variable percentage, l, into LI (LOC insurance)
and L0 (liquidity) (see Section 2.3.1 for further
details).
For clarity, we write the obvious explicit relation,
ρ = fc + fi + S + LT .

(2)

We expect that the system will maintain fixed fees, but
will vary S, l and LT (and hence ρ) on a case-by-case basis
to control the stability and viability of the ChronoBank
ecosystem. The purpose of the Liquidity Reserve and Security Guarantee Funds are detailed in the Funds Section
(2.3) and a brief discussion of the economic feasibility of
this system is discussed in Section 3.

2.2.1. Minting
The minting process takes place when a company offering labour-hours (Labour-Offering Company (LOC))
chooses to enter into a legally binding agreement with the
CBE. The CBE must then run strict checks (the guidelines
of which are described in the business outline [9]) of the
LOC wishing to participate in the ChronoBank system.
Once the LOC is approved, the CBE and LOC will negotiate on various parameters (summarised in Appendix
B) before entering a legally binding contract whereby the
LOC promises labour-hours in exchange for LHT (or the
fiat equivalent). The CBE will then publish a hash of the
contract on the Ethereum blockchain and store the contract on a decentralised storage system such as IPFS [10] or
SWARM [11]. This gives a transparent ledger detailing the
current state of the backed LHT. The exact mechanisms
behind the minting process are non-trivial and we refer the
reader to Figures 4 and 5 during the following discussion
of the process. When an LOC and the CBE have agreed
on terms, the CBE mints the equivalent amount of LHT
as labour-hours offered by the LOC, ensuring the 1 to 1
relationship between the two. Of the newly minted tokens,
the CBE will retain ρ percent3, providing the remaining
(1 − ρ) of minted LHT to the LOC. In practice, the CBE
can sell the (1 − ρ) of minted LHT on exchanges and provide the LOC with the fiat equivalent, should they not
wish to deal with cryptocurrencies. The ρ percent held by
the CBE will be immediately subdivided into the following
portions (shown diagrammatically in Figure 5).
• fc ∈ [0, 0.01] - A fee charged by the CBE for
services provided.
• fi - The issuance fee which will go to the rewards contract for TIME token holders (see Section 2.1.2).

Figure 4. Procedural overview of the ChronoBank minting process.

Figure 5. Fund distribution of minted LHT.
2.2.2. Redemption
As LHT are fundamentally backed by real-world labourhours, holders may redeem their tokens at any time
for these backed hours. To do so, holders will deposit
their LHT into a redemption contract on the Ethereum
blockchain. Along with the deposit, holders will provide
relevant data detailing their redemption request, such as

3All percentages introduced in this document should be read as decimals. Hence (1 − ρ) ≥ 0.

CHRONOBANK - PHASE 1: A NON-VOLATILE DIGITAL TOKEN BACKED BY LABOUR-HOURS

labour type(s), location(s) of work, date/time of work, contact information, etc. The request will trigger the CBE to
search and match relevant LOCs to the redemption request.
If found, the CBE will return the most suitable LOCs that
fit the request. To discourage recurrent requests and to
remunerate the CBE for its service, the CBE will take a
small fee, fr ∈ [0, 0.01] from the deposited tokens. The
amount of labour-hours matched will be less than or equal
to the LHT tokens deposited, less the CBE’s fee. Any
unmatched requests or unfulfilled hours can be withdrawn
from the redemption contract by the depositor. As a redundancy, the redemption contract will have a built-in
holding period, after which depositors may withdraw their
deposited LHT. This protects depositors from inactive or
stagnant CBEs.
Once the CBE has returned a list of compatible LOCs,
a depositor may accept or reject the offered LOC(s). If
rejected, the depositor can withdraw their deposited LHT
less the CBE’s service fee. If accepted, the CBE will advise
the chosen LOC of all relevant details. The redemption contract will hold the LHT until the work has been completed
and the depositor is satisfied. A dispute resolution system
may be used to ensure work is completed as requested.
Once the labour has been satisfactorily completed, the
deposited LHT will be destroyed, again ensuring the 1 to
1 relationship of LHT to backed labour-hours.
2.2.3. Intrinsic Value
We have thus far ensured a 1 to 1 correspondence between LHT and labour-hours but have not yet defined
the value of either. The intrinsic value of one LHT and
thus one labour-hour is region-dependant. Although any
arbitrary value can be chosen, we peg the value of one
LHT to be roughly the average hourly wage of a region for
practical reasons.
The average hourly wage of a region will be defined
via the official statistics bureau of that specific region. If
one were to trivially adjust the LHT to the most recent
statistics released for a given region, the price of LHT
would stepwise shift on the release date of the statistics.
Typically these statistics are released yearly and in such
scenarios a predictive stepwise jump each year would occur. To implement a smooth transition from one statistics
point to another, we propose that the pegged price of LHT
be a linear interpolation between the two points. This
would require the LHT price to lag behind the most recent
statistics by the duration of at least one extra statistics
release.
Let us illustrate this with a clear example, as depicted in
Figure 6. Let us determine the price of LHT during April,
2010 in a region where the statistics bureau publishes a
data point in January each year. This data point indicates
the average wage in that region for the previous year. The
price will be calculated by retrieving two data points: A2008
and A2009 , the average wage in 2008 (released in January,
2009) and the average wage in 2009 (released in January,
2010) respectively. We take a linear interpolation between
these two points to find the price of LHT in April, 2010.
In this example, this will over-approximate4 the average
wage in April, 2008. This example shows that the LHT
price in April 2010 will be the over-approximated average

5

wage in April 2008, demonstrating how the pegged price
of LHT will lag behind the current actual average wage.
It should be noted that this doesn’t affect any aspects of
offering or redeeming labour. The value of labour offered
or redeemed is independent of the price of a single LHT.
However, the value will be measured with respect to the
fixed price of a single LHT token.

Figure 6. The base price of one LHT in April 2010, X,
can be calculated as the linear interpolation between the
average wage in 2008 and 2009 (A2008 and A2009 ).
For any given region, typically there are sub-regions
which have varying costs associated with providing labour
work. We wish to integrate these costs within our definition of a single LHT. To do so, we take the maximum of
each cost within a sub-region and add it to the average
wage of the region to provide the fundamental price of
LHT. Specifically we have:
L = (1 + max(Y )) X ,

(3)

where X is the linearly interpolated function of average
wages described above and Y is the individual cost in a
sub-region as a percentage of work done. L as defined
in equation (3) is the pegged price of LHT for any given
region. This value will vary linearly throughout each year
in a transparent and predictable manner.

2.3. Funds
The uniqueness of backing a digital token with contractual debt requires various safeguards to ensure contracts
are always upheld and potential defaulting is accounted
for. There are a number of adverse scenarios that can
occur with a debt-backed system. Our proposed solutions
involve the careful maintenance of two extra funds, the
Liquidity Reserve and the Security Guarantee Fund (SGF).
In this section we detail the operation of these funds and
how they address some of the issues that can arise in this
system.
2.3.1. Liquidity Reserve
The liquidity reserve is an offline LHT storage fund
controlled by the CBE. It receives a percentage, LT , of
newly minted LHT during the minting process (Section
2.2.1). There are two services that this function provides
the ChronoBank system:

4This is a poor approximation that assumes a linear growth, where the start of the year is the average wage of that year and the end of
the year the is average wage of the following year.

CHRONOBANK - PHASE 1: A NON-VOLATILE DIGITAL TOKEN BACKED BY LABOUR-HOURS

(1) LOC Risk Mitigation - During the minting process,
an LOC will be paid (1 − ρ) percent of the labourhours they contractually agree to provide. Therefore LOCs inherently take some risk in the form
of immediate redemption. If an LOC’s promise of
labour-hours is immediately redeemed, they stand
to lose ρ percent of these hours. To mitigate this,
the CBE will store a percentage of minted LHT,
LI (see Section 2.2.1) for each LOC, to reimburse
the LOC in the event that more than (1−ρ) labourhours are redeemed. LI will cover all excess (i.e.
more than (1 − ρ) ) redeemed tokens until the
reserve, LI , is depleted.
We formalise this by introducing the mitigated
tokens payed to an LOC, LM , as
LM = min(LI , E) .

(4)

where E is the excess LHT to be redeemed by the
LOC, defined as:
(
R − (1 − ρ), if R > (1 − ρ).
E=

0,
if R ≤ (1 − ρ).
with R being the total percentage of LHT redeemed.
The mitigation reserve, LI is not constant, but
is gradually transferred to the SGF (Section 2.3.2).
The rate at which this fund is transferred is derived from the parameter, M , which specifies the
total number of months until the funds are entirely transferred, and is negotiated during the
minting process. The mitigation reserve funds will
be transferred monthly at a uniform rate (LI /M ).
This procedure then allows the CBE to statistically choose ρ, LT and M given the risk profile
and reputation of any given LOC during the minting process. For example, ρ, LT and M can be
designed such that within a 95 percent confidence
interval, an LOC does not lose more than (ρ − ζ)
worth of the labour-hours promised over a given
time5. Here ζ is a number that quantifies the risk
that the LOC is willing to accept. This degree
of freedom allows the CBE to manage LOCs of
varying risk profiles.
(2) LHT Liquidity - The price of LHT will ultimately
be governed by the price at which the CBE buys
and sells LHT6. The funds used for this are stored
in the Liquidity Reserve. L0 of newly minted tokens (see Section 2.2.1) will be accrued in this
fund. The CBE will then stabilise the price of
LHT and provide liquidity in various markets by
buying and selling LHT at the fundamental price
detailed in Section 2.2.3.
The parameter, l, chosen during contract negotiations, specifies the percentage of LT that goes to
LI (the amount used for LOC insurance and which
is gradually transferred to the Safety Guarantee
Fund) and L0 (the amount that is permanently
used for liquidity). Through careful management
of the parameter, l, the CBE can maintain the
desired volume of funds in the Liquidity Reserve.

6

As this fund will hold both LHT and volatile currencies, care must be taken to manage volume
due to the potential price fluctuations of the held
currencies.
One immediate-use case of this fund will be in
the initial system set-up. When the first LOCs become part of the system, the freshly minted LHTs
will need to be sold to transfer the resulting funds
to the LOC. Initially the demand for LHT will
be low and funds from the Liquidity Reserve will
be used to bootstrap this process. A percentage
of the crowdsale funds will be deposited into the
Liquidity Reserve for this purpose.
2.3.2. Security Guarantee Fund
One of the major drawbacks in a debt-backed currency
system is the possibility of backers (LOC in our case) defaulting on their contractual obligations. Despite the care
in vetting LOCs during the minting process, we expect
there to be a percentage of companies that will inevitably
default. The SGF’s main purpose is to provide a fund reservoir as insurance to protect against defaulting companies.
In practice, this fund will burn held LHT tokens to the
equivalent amount of outstanding labour-hours promised
by the defaulting LOC.
Statistical estimates should be taken for the average
probability of LOCs defaulting. These estimates will give a
measure defining the amount of LHT that should be stored
inside the SGF fund at any given time. The amount stored
in the SGF will be proportional to the amount of debt, and
hence be proportional to the amount of LHT in existence
(as every LHT is backed by one owed labour-hour). This
required value can be reached and maintained through the
management of the minting variables, S, l and LT .

3. Economic Considerations
In this section we briefly mention some interesting properties and immediate economic consequences of this system.

3.1. Economic Incentives
First and foremost, the system must be designed such
that there are economic incentives for both LOCs and LHT
holders to participate in the system. For an LOC, the incentive to participate in the ChronoBank system comes in
the form of an interest-free-like loan. When an LOC agrees
to participate in the system and offers labour-hours, the
company effectively receives an interest-free loan, which
needs to be paid back when their contract expires. For
this to be enticing to an LOC, we require that over the
period of the contract the amount of money paid for the
service of the loan is less than that of alternate means for
loans, e.g. local bank loans.
We consider a simplistic example to demonstrate the
feasibility of such a scenario. Consider that a bank loan,
which charges IB percent in interest per annum, has an
upfront cost of C and is of total amount H. Over a period of time, t, and assuming no regular repayments are

5This can occur because the holdings of an LOC increase over time due to assumed external investment.
6Combined with the fact that one LHT has a fundamental intrinsic value of one labour-hour.
7We use a no-repayment loan to clarify the analogy to our system and remove some mathematical complexity which obscures our point.

CHRONOBANK - PHASE 1: A NON-VOLATILE DIGITAL TOKEN BACKED BY LABOUR-HOURS

necessary7, the LOC stands to lose:
C + H((1 + IB )t − 1) − HII t .

(6)

The first term corresponds to the upfront cost of the loan,
the second term to total interest owed at time, t, and
the final term is potential interest earnings from external
investments. Here we’ve defined an average yearly interest
gain from external investments, II .
Alternatively, the LOC may participate with the
ChronoBank system. If the LOC offers H hours of labour,
it would receive H(1 − ρ) LHT in return, and would be
required to pay (1 + σt)H worth of LHT back upon the
expiration of the contract (assumed at time, t). Here σ is a
percentage representing the average yearly price increase8
of LHT. It quantifies an inflated price of LHT due to an
assumed increase in average wage over the contract period.
Therefore, with the ChronoBank system, the LOC stands
to lose,
H(ρ + σt) − (1 − ρ)HII t .

(7)

The first term here originates from the initial sum taken
by ChronoBank, Hρ, and from the price fluctuation of
LHT over time. The second term comes from the potential
earnings from external investments with the (1 − ρ)H LHT
received.
In this simplistic example, an LOC would be economically incentivised to participate in the ChronoBank system
if the total fees of the ChronoBank system are less than
the total fees of the alternative bank loan, explicitly:

H(ρ + (σ + ρII )t) < C + H (1 + IB )t − 1 . (8)
Here, (σ + ρII ) represents the average yearly price fluctuation of LHT combined with ρ percent of an average
expected investment return. With the reasonable assumption that this quantity is less than the interest rate of a
bank loan, IB , equation (8) can always be satisfied for
some time period, t, given all other variables fixed. In
fact, the longer the contractual time, t, the greater the
cost-saving is to the LOC. So in this simplistic example, we
can see that this system incentivises LOCs to participate
in the ChronoBank system for longer periods of time9.
Furthermore, the CBE and LOC are able to adjust both
H and ρ during the negotiations of their initial contractual
agreement, enabling the tuning of economic incentives in
less favourable economic regions/scenarios.
As for LHT holders, their economic incentive is more
obvious. LHT, compared to its stable-coin predecessors, is
inflationary-resistant. Therefore, holders should have an
economic incentive to use LHT as its value should increase
relative to local inflationary fiat currencies. We should
note that buying and holding LHT as an investment (and
therefore decreasing the liquidity of the token) is not in a
holder’s best interest, as the gains in doing so are often
less than external investment strategies.

3.2. System Stability
This section is concerned with the ability of the
ChronoBank system to sustain various economic hurdles,
which we refer to as its stability.

7

The stability of the ChronoBank system hinges on the
CBE correctly managing the minting process. Through
the minting process, the two funds, Liquidity Reserve and
SGF, are controlled and maintained.
As the system grows, funds will accrue in both the Liquidity Reserve and the SGF. LHT is only removed from
the SGF in the event of an LOC defaulting. The Liquidity
Reserve only decreases in value in the event that a held
volatile currency devalues. Therefore, both funds should
grow as the system evolves. As the funds reach a sustainable level, the percentage of LHT taken during the minting,
ρ, can be decreased, further enhancing the economic incentive for more LOCs to join the system. A greater number
of LOCs participating will mean a greater number of LHT
in existence and a greater volume of funds accrued in both
the SGF and Liquidity Reserve. The stability of the system
will be proportional to the value stored in the SGF and
Liquidity Reserve and, therefore, we expect the system to
become more stable as it develops.

3.3. Potential Pitfalls
A number of potential pitfalls can occur during the operation of this system. In this section we briefly summarise
the major and most obvious ones, along with our proposed
solutions.

• An LOC defaulting on its promise of labour-hours.
As previously mentioned, this will be covered by
the SGF. The CBE will burn the necessary LHT
from the SGF fund to maintain the 1 to 1 relation
of LHT to labour-hours.
• Large supply/demand causing price fluctuations.
This can be handled by a sufficiently deep Liquidity Reserve, which will provide demand in times
of high supply and vice versa. Initially funds from
the crowdsale will be placed into the liquidity fund,
and as the system grows the liquidity fund will be
maintained at a level deemed operationally safe
to cover this scenario.
• Redemption of all LHT. The LHT at any given
time will always be backed by contractual labourhours in a 1 to 1 mapping. Therefore, this scenario
is possible and the system will continue to function
in this event. However, the risk in this occurrence
lies with the participating LOCs, who will be required to pay back their LHT in the form of labour.
The SGF (Section 2.3.1) can also absorb some of
the cost of this scenario. It will be at the CBE’s
discretion to use the SGF to assist in this very
unlikely scenario.
• Increased demand at contract expiry. As a contract expires, an LOC will be required to buy back
an equivalent amount of LHT to the labour-hours
that are left on the contract. This could potentially create periods of large demand. In these
scenarios, we will counter the demand with the
Liquidity Reserve and, if necessary, the SGF.

8This could also potentially decrease.
9Adding regular repayments to bank loans adds complexity to this simplistic example and although decreasing the size of the right-hand

side of equation (8) it does not change our final result.

4. Future Work

5. Conclusion

Economic Models. Key to the success of the ChronoBank
system is an informed choice of the aforementioned economic parameters. It is essential to perform further analysis so as to determine how parameter modification impacts
the feasibility and sustainability of the system in a wider
context. This will necessarily be performed before a realworld implementation is constructed.
LaborX. The digital asset transfer system described in
this document is proposed as a first step towards a larger
decentralised labour system. LHT as described by this
paper forms the base currency for a decentralised labour exchange platform entitled LaborX. The intention of LaborX
is to enable peer-to-peer exchange of labour-hours with
LHT, thereby reducing the centralisation of the proposed
ChronoBank system. LaborX will incorporate a rating
system whereby holders of LHT can identify fair trades by
examining the quality and/or specialisation of the labour
provider, given their history on the platform. By enabling
direct exchange of LHT with labour-hours, the system’s
dependency on contractual arrangements with LOCs is
significantly reduced. This potentially reduces the cost
and increases the stability of the system as a whole.

This paper proposes a non-volatile, inflationaryresistant, digital asset transfer system. This innovative
system is only made possible by recent advancements in
blockchain and cryptographic technologies. Leveraging
these technologies, this system tokenises contractual debt
in a manner that can be both economically feasible and
highly practical for digital platforms, such as LaborX. The
intrinsic value of the proposed token mirrors the average
hourly rate of human labour - the most fundamental unit
of economic value.

Appendix A. Terminology
The following is a list of terms used throughout this document.
• CBE - The ChronoBank Entity.
• LHT - Labour-Hour Token.
• LOC - Labour-Offering Company.
• SGF - Security Guarantee Fund.

Appendix B. Minting Contract Parameters
There are number of parameters that are required to be negotiated during the minting process. For clarity we list here
the variables that should be considered and determined by the CBE during the minting process:
• S - A percentage of the minted tokens to be stored in the Security Guarantee Fund.
• LT - The total percentage to be stored in the liquidity fund.
• l - The percentage of LT dictating how much of the liquidity fund is used as LOC insurance, LI . The remaining
funds will be kept for liquidity in L0 .
• M - The total number of months until the LOC Insurance LI is transferred to the Security Guarantee Fund.
This dictates the rate at which the funds are transferred, i.e. LI /M per month.
• Expiry Date - The expiry date of the contract, whereby the LOC must buy back the value of the minted LHT.
Through the definition of the above variables, the CBE on a case-by-case basis will fix ρ, the total percentage deducted
from LOCs initially through the relation (2).

Appendix C. Fee Summary
The fees of the ChronoBank system can be summarised in the following:
• fc - This is the fee taken by the CBE during the minting process for services rendered. We expect fc ∈ [0, 0.01].
• fi - This is the issuance fee, which will be taken during minting and deposited into the TIME token holder’s
rewards contract. This will start at 3 percent and decrease by 1 percent each year until it is maintained at a
steady 1 percent.
• ft - These are transaction fees, which are deposited into the TIME token holders rewards contract. This is a flat
fee of 0.15%.
• fr - This is a fee taken by the CBE during the redemption process for services provided and to add a deterrent
to continual redemption requests. We expect fc ∈ [0, 0.01].

Abstract
As the blockchain industry expands and the number and value of crypto assets
increase, the market for crypto-investing and speculation will also grow. Crypto
markets are borderless, open 24/7, subject to minimal regulatory control, and offer
huge potentials for growth. Because of these characteristics, crypto markets
represent an incredible, new opportunity for investors over traditional markets.
Currently, the crypto-investment market is primed to attract new investors into the
blockchain industry. However, the learning curve for investing in crypto assets is
extremely steep and the marketplace lacks sophisticated tools and information
products that will encourage new users to make the jump into the crypto community.
CoinDash is an operating system for crypto assets.
Our goal is to lower the barriers of entry to crypto investment markets by providing
tools and services that make interacting, handling and trading crypto assets
accessible to everyone. CoinDash will offer its products through a unified platform
designed with the mainstream user in mind.

Introduction
One of most potentially transformative use-cases for blockchain technology is the
ability to create new crypto assets. Such assets are increasingly becoming an
alternative to traditional capital markets because they enable new models of
participation, are borderless, can be traded around the clock, are subject to much less
regulation, and are easy to create. The past few years have shown a dramatic
increase in trading volume, market capitalization, and the number of projects using
crypto tokens.
Blockchain technology presents a real challenge and requires a steep learning curve
even for experienced blockchain users, let alone from newcomers. Today, many
blockchain-based applications are difficult to use. Interacting, managing and
investing in crypto assets should be easy and intuitive. Currently, the lack of proper
tools create barriers to entry that limit mainstream adoption.

Opportunity
Market Analysis
Crypto asset investment and speculation is a rapidly growing market.
In 2016, trade volume increased by more than 150%​ [1] ​at the same time that the
overall market capitalization of crypto assets​ [2] ​grew tremendously. While bitcoin
represents a large portion of the total market, the value of other crypto assets is
significant and on the rise. In recent years bitcoin dropped from 95% of the market
capitalization to as low as 75%. All signs indicate that this trend will continue and we
will likely see other non-Bitcoin tokens increase their market capitalizations.
Crypto assets are an attractive investment opportunity for a number of reasons:
Borderless 24/7 trading - ​while other markets have set trading hours, crypto assets
are traded around the clock, from places all around the world.
​Little

trading friction - ​traditional assets are heavily controlled. Regulations govern

asset issuance and exchange, creating enormous barriers to entry for the investor

and entrepreneur alike. The result is a closed garden that disproportionately benefits
existing institutions and puts retail investors at a disadvantage. Even accountants
charged with overseeing them​ c
​ an be corrupted​.​ Crypto assets on the blockchain

offers built-in transparency, are currently less regulated, and issuing and trading are
more inclusive and open to anyone. This creates an incredibly competitive market,
lower costs and more opportunities for superior returns. How they will be regulated in
the future is unclear, but at the moment, there is little friction and the features of
blockchain technology suggest that regulation, when it comes, could be lighter than
that on traditional capital markets.
Easy to issue new assets -​ With a few lines of code anyone can issue their own crypto
asset and offer it to the world

Initial-Coin-Offering (ICO): a new funding paradigm
Venture capital (VC) saw its biggest rise during the 1960s and 1970s when VC funds
started focusing on fast growing companies. Those companies were concentrated in
the tech sector and promised to lead breakthroughs in electronics, medicine and data
processing. As a result, venture capital became synonymous with technology finance,
evolving with the needs of the companies and enabling them to grow at astounding
rates. One can argue that VCs played a crucial role in the technology revolution.
In the blockchain era, traditional venture capitalists are taking a backseat to ICOs.
ICOs enable new blockchain start ups to raise seed money by issuing crypto tokens
that represent an underlying asset. One such case is the Ethereum blockchain ICO
which raised more than $15 million in 2014. ICOs are a new funding model for start
ups that is playing an important role in the blockchain industry, the same way VCs
played a major role in the technology revolution.

Target Users
Interest and media coverage of blockchain technology has been expanding rapidly in
the last few years. This increasing awareness of the promise of blockchain
technology has greatly expanded the number of people who can be considered
potential crypto-users. These are people who are interested in blockchains, but feel
intimidated by the high technological barriers of entry typical of most blockchain
products.
If token creation (and therefore investments) are the most common use-case for
blockchain technology, then enabling more and more people to invest in crypto assets
is of the highest importance. CoinDash’s investment tools will attract experienced
crypto-investors to our platform. At the same time, CoinDash’s social networking
tools and information products will lower the barrier to entry for potential users and
bring new investment dollars into the blockchain industry.
The potential growth for the blockchain space and CoinDash comes from the
as-of-yet untapped future blockchain users who are interested in the technology, but
currently lack the tools to participate in the blockchain economy. Providing high
performance investment tools will encourage more people to enter blockchain
markets.

CoinDash Ecosystem
Structure
Overview
Crypto investments represent a new paradigm in investing and funding ventures. The
CoinDash product is an innovative ​Market Network​[10]​, ​employing the best of

marketplaces, social networks, and SaaS​[11]​ to address the needs of tomorrow's
crypto investors.

CoinDash - Market Network

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
Investing requires tailored tools to make trades as efficient as possible, represent
data accurately, and help the investor make decisions. CoinDash’s SaaS layer
includes an array of independent and self-contained tools, custom designed for
managing and interacting with crypto assets.

Crypto assets are an attractive investment opportunity for a number of reasons:
Portfolio Management - ​automatically queries added crypto accounts (ethereum,

bitcoin, exchanges, etc) to build a complete picture of the portfolio’s performance,
risk, and diversification analytics.
​ICO

automation - ​enables IF-THEN automations on ICO investments. Example: invest

in ICO X if 75% of the cap is raised within the first 24 hours.

Trade Automation -​ enables IF-THEN automations on trades.

Network (Social)
Many blockchain investors, and certainly new users, will find it difficult to navigate the
complexity of the blockchain space, understand what assets to hold, when to buy,
when to sell, and which ICOs are worth participating in. This steep learning curve
creates a real barrier of entry for many people interested in investing in the blockchain
space.
Some crypto investors became leaders in discovering and assessing new investment
opportunities. With CoinDash’s social network tools, experienced investors can
monetise their knowledge and expertise by sharing their portfolio performance with
other users. Expert investors can earn fees and gain influence by accumulating
followers on the network.

11

Signal Trading
Singal trading is a social trading feature which enables users to receive real-time
trading signals from top investors. The signals are specific and detail the amount
traded, assets, and the exchange or blockchain. Users can then choose to act on the
signal or not. ​The signals are generated automatically by the portfolio management

core which is aware of all the trades followed by the user, guaranteeing validity and
transparency. ​Signal trading is a good way to get acquainted with market dynamics
and learn what the top investors are doing.
Example:

Fee Structure​: The user pays a recurring subscription to get real-time trading signals
from a particular investor.

Copy-Trading
Copy-trading is an automated trade engine based on the signal-trading feature. Users
can set aside a portion of their token holdings to copy-trade top investors. ​CoinDash
and the copied investor never hold any funds in the process.

Copy-trading on CoinDash is completely decentralized and governed by a dedicated
system of smart contracts. The smart contracts promote security and transparency,
enabling developers to enhance the functionality and offering users custom modules
(see developers section).This gives the user complete control of their funds.

12

Example:
ICO copy-trade:
A common example for copy-trading will be an ICO. A user follows a top trader who
invests in an ethereum (can be any blockchain who supports token creation) based
ICO. CoinDash detects the ICO investment and immediately generates a copy-trade
request. Once the request is validated by the smart contract, the user participates in
the ICO.

Exchange copy-trade:
The copied user buys Golem(GNT) tokens with ether. The user’s copy-trade smart
contract receives a request to send the cheapest exchange account the user holds a
predetermined amount of cryptocurrency. Once the request is validated by the smart
contract, it sends funds to the exchange. CoinDash sends the exchange, via API, a
trade request. Once the trade is executed, CoinDash can automatically send the
bought GNT tokens back to the smart contract. ​All fund transfers are between
user-owned accounts; CoinDash did not hold any funds.

Marketplace
CoinDash’s marketplace is built around maximizing opportunity discovery and
streamlining trading. Using data generated by the SaaS and network layers, CoinDash
will enable users to make trades directly on the platform.

Trading signals
User’s can follow top traders and receive real-time trading signals from them. With
the marketplace, the user will be able to act on a signal directly from CoinDash and
track its performance seamlessly.

13

ICO dashboard
Keeping track of ICOs is getting harder and harder as their number and quality keep
getting higher and higher. CoinDash integrates with leading research and content
creators to bring accurate and reliable information in a graphical ICO dashboard. This
enables the user to keep track of past, present and future ICOs and invest in them
using CoinDash. CoinDash users will never have to worry about missing a promising
ICO ever again.

Trending assets
It's important to get a full overview of the market and the different assets in a clear
and precise manner. CoinDash will be a one-stop resource for the information a
crypto investor needs to track the performance of all crypto-assets, make informed
decisions, and act on market trends.

3rd party integration
New investment channels are being developed all the time. Enabling users to easily
interact with investment opportunities and keep track of their performance is
important. CoinDash will build a dedicated SDK for developers to integrate 3rd party
investment instruments and enable users to invest in them directly from CoinDash.

Example:
Melonport​[12]​ is a project that creates the infrastructure for decentralized funds.
Integrating it with CoinDash will enable our users to discover new investment
opportunities, invest in them, and track their performance.

Blockchain Supported
CoinDash strives to support all smart contract blockchains for social trading features.
The current implementations support ​ethereum and RSK
[12]​ ​https://melonport.com

14

Developers
CoinDash will make tools available for developers to extend functionality
and offer greater value to users.
SaaS ​-​ ​The tools developed by CoinDash for crypto investors under the portfolio
management platform will enable module creation for pricing source, trade and
transaction history, account types, indexes calculations, and more.
Network​ - The copy-trade architecture is built around a smart contract system which
promotes transparency and extensibility. All plugin modules will enable 3rd party
developers the opportunity to create their own implementations.
Marketplace​ - Enabling 3rd party investment instruments to integrate is necessary to
promote a better marketplace for developers and investors. CoinDash will enable 3rd
party developers to integrate such tools and expose them to CoinDash users.

CoinDash Token
Every feature in the CoinDash platform that gives any financial value to its user will
require them to pay a fee. Every user who facilitates the use of a feature which in turn

ABSTRACT

time of day and days of week such as weekends and holidays. Cities may employ noise abatement inspectors to enforce noise guidelines. However, proving noise variance when
code violations occur isnât easy with existing methods. Frustrated residents end up calling local bylaw enforcement or
noise control officers. However, without any proof of code
violation thereâs not much a noise control officer can do.
There is both objective and subjective evidence for the
evidence of non-auditory effects of noise on health and wellbeing which are caused by exposure to noise [13]. Exposure
to levels above 40 dB(A) begins to influence well being and
levels above 60 dB(A) are considered detrimental to health.
There is good evidence, largely from laboratory studies, that
noise exposure impairs performance [8]. Noise exposure during sleep may increase blood pressure, heart rate and finger
pulse amplitude as well as body movements. There may
also be after-effects during the day following disturbed sleep;
perceived sleep quality, mood and performance in terms of
reaction time are all decreased following sleep disturbed by
noise [14].
In this paper we present Decibel.LIVE, a novel approach
to noise pollution monitoring using blockchain technology
and smartphones. Leveraging the decentralized nature of
the blockchain and the continuous climb in smartphone ownership and internet usage, we present an open and low-cost
platform to monitor noise pollution.

Noise pollution is one of the leading causes which adversely
affect the well-being and quality of life of residents in urban
areas. In this paper we present Decibel.LIVE, a blockchain
based decentralized platform to monitor urban noise and
compensate residents living around the noise sites. With the
Decibel.LIVE smartphone app, citizens can measure their
personal exposure to noise using smartphones as noise sensors and report excess noise to business owners responsible
for the noise sites over private encrypted channels. The
platform also implements a settlements infrastructure based
on blockchain technology which enables business owners to
compensate residents affected by noise in real-time. The
platform aggregates noise levels in a given region and presents
visual noise propagation models which can be used by communities and local noise enforcement officers to enforce noise
guidelines.

INTRODUCTION

Noise is often described as unwanted sound which is unpleasant and disruptive to hearing. It affects quality of life
because it interferes with activities like sleep, relaxation,
conversation or listening to music, TV, radio or natural
sounds.
In recent decades, increases in population have also led to
increases in traffic, construction, demolition and other noise
Noise pollution is a common problem in urban environments,
affecting human behavior, health and even childrenâs cognitive development.
Typically, cities and towns have established guidelines on
noise levels allowed in residential areas. Local laws and bylaws may restrict general construction and other sources of
noise depending on the neighborhood, commercial zones,

NOISE ASSESSMENT
Lisez Euler, lisez Euler, câest notre matre tous.
â Pierre-Simon Laplace

This section summarizes noise measurement techniques
particularly environment noise. We review noise measurement techniques and tools to capture noise data.
Sound or noise is the result of pressure variations, or oscillations, in an elastic medium (e.g., air, water, solids), generated by a vibrating surface. Sound propagates in the form
of longitudinal waves, involving a succession of compressions
and rarefactions in the elastic medium [6]. Appendix A gives
a glossary of acoustic terminology.
As sound waves travel outward from the source, their
intensity (loudness) expressed as watts per square meter
(W/m2 ) steadily decreases due to several natural phenomena such as spreading with distance, absorption by the atmosphere and wind and temperature changes. In a free field,
the intensity and sound pressure at a given point, at a distance r (in meters) from the source, is expressed by [6]:

when the application is deployed to Ethereum mainnet.

hours. Therefore a single dB(A) measurement isnt a very
good indicator of noise pollution. A much better indication
is a logarithmic average, LAeq,T which is the metric of choice
for measuring exposure to noise.
LAeq,T is the equivalent continuous dB(A) level which has
the same energy as the original fluctuating noise for the same
given period of time T and is defined as [12]:

LAeq,T = 10log10 (

Z
0

T

pA (t)2
dt)
p20

(3)

where pA (t) is obtained from applying A-weighting filter
to the raw acoustic signal p(t) and p0 is a standard reference value corresponding to the minimal audible acoustic
signal (20ÂľP a in air). The raw acoustic signal p(t) is filtered
(A-weighting) to compute the relative loudness of sound as
perceived by the human ear. A weighting is (formally defined standards IEC 61672-1 and ANSI 1.43) in the analog
or frequency domain and converted to a time domain digital
filter, normally done with z-transform or bilinear transform.
Zero dB(A) is considered the point at which a person begins to hear sound[3]. A soft whisper at 1 meter measures at
30 dB(A), a busy freeway at 15 meters at around 80 dB(A),
and a chain saw can reach 110 dB(A) or more at operating
distance. Brief exposure to noise levels exceeding 120 dB(A)
without hearing protection may even cause physical pain.
Decibel.LIVE smartphone app implements filtering to produce dB(A) events.

where Ď and c are the air density and speed of sound respectively.
From the preceding equation, if the sound pressure level,
Lm , is measured at some reference distance, rm , from the
noise source then the sound pressure level at some other
distance, r, may be estimated using [1]:
p2 = ĎcI =

Techniques for capturing noise levels

Techniques to monitor noise in urban areas vary based
on jurisdictions. Typically, noise measurements in urban
areas are carried out by designated officers or consultants
who collect data at a particular location using a sound level
meter or similar microphone-equipped device. However, the
measuring sessions take place only at few accessible spots
and during short time intervals (e.g., 30 minutes).
There are a number of limitations with such approaches.
Noise mapping campaigns are expensive due to need of expertise and human resources, the deployment of sound level
meter devices and the processing effort. Also, data collection at sparse locations and at specific times often produce
computational models with an unknown error margins.

r
)
(2)
rm
It follows that in free field conditions, the noise level decreases by 6 dB each time the distance between the source
and the observer doubles (See Figure 1).
However, free-field conditions donât exist in urban environments so, in general the equation relating sound pressure
level and sound power level is modified to account for the
presence of reflecting surfaces.
In the near field where distance from the source is equal
to about a wavelength of sound or equal to three times
the largest dimension of the sound source (whichever is the
larger), the sound field does not decrease by 6 dB each time
the distance from the source is increased (as it does in the
far field).
Our focus is the far field of a source which begins where
the near field ends and extends to infinity. This is the field
where the citizens affected by noise pollution reside. Note
that the transition from near to far field is gradual in the
transition region. In the far field, the direct field radiated
by most machinery sources will decay at the rate of 6 dB
each time the distance from the source is doubled. For line
sources such as traffic noise, the decay rate varies between
3 dB and 4 dB [6].

Alternative Approaches

Over the last few years, smartphone adoption has been
rising worldwide[10]. Modern smartphones have significant
computational power, always-on internet connectivity and
built-in sensors such as microphones, cameras, global positioning system (GPS) receiver, accelerometers, gyroscopes,
and proximity and light sensors making them as sensors
carried by humans rather than placed at static locations.
Smartphone developers now offer many sound measurement
applications that are accurate and reliable to be used to assess occupational noise exposures[7]. This has given rise to
a low-cost alternative to traditional large-scale, costly and
difficult to manage sensing infrastructure based on sensor
networks.
One such novel implementation is NoiseTube[9] which is
a mobile application platform that monitors noise pollution
involving the general public. Citizens measure their personal
exposure to noise in their everyday environment by using
GPS-equipped mobile phones as noise sensors. VANET[11]

Measuring environmental noise dB(A)

The basic unit of measurement for environmental noise, as
recommended by ISO 1996/1, is the dB(A). Noise emission
limits are also usually expressed in dB(A). Noise levels may
be measured at any moment, but noise levels vary widely
with time, e.g., traffic noise is higher at noon than at midnight and higher still during the morning and evening rush

noise data. These projects show that smartphones can be
used effectively as noise sensors to monitor noise pollution.

seconds on average, the Ethereum transaction rate is slower
than that of a typical centralized database.
Also, storing every transaction in a smart contract can be
expensive due to the gas price.
State channels are a promising approach[2] addressing the
scaling problem by moving some of the transactions off chain,
while preserving the systems decentralized structure and
strong integrity guarantees.
Instead of submitting every transaction to the blockchain,
state channels employ the blockchain to first establish a
shared deposit between two parties. The parties interact
directly and communicate with the blockchain only to close
channels or to resolve disputes between the parties. Therefore state channels dramatically increase the transaction rate
while preserving all the benefits of the blockchain.
A state channel ĎP1 âP2 between two parties P1 and P2
is created on chain using a hashed time locked contract
CP reimage which acts as an escrow. A channel is initialized when party P1 creates a conditional commitment (a
micropayment or a bid etc.) by sending a hash h to preimage contract CP reimage such that h = H(Ď) is the hash of a
secret string Ď only known to party P1 . The channel is valid
until time TExpiry .
The state of the channel is concluded in one of three ways:

ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN
TCP implementations will follow a general principle of
robustness: be conservative in what you do, be liberal in
what you accept from others.
â Jon Postel, RFC: 793, Transmission Control Protocol

In the strictest sense, a blockchain 1 is a type of database
that is shared across nodes geographically distributed in a
network. No single entity owns the data on a blockchain and
the design of a blockchain makes it infeasible to modify data
once itâs published on a public blockchain like Ethereum.
We have chosen Ethereum blockchain as the platform for
Decibel.LIVE service.

3.1

Why Ethereum?

For Decibel.LIVE, the primary use of blockchain is as a
shared public database. We want any user of Decibel.LIVE
to be able to submit a transaction to the blockchain. The
transaction propagates throughout the network and is eventually committed into a consistent ordered ledger.
Any party can view all the transactions committed on the
blockchain. If any partyâs view includes a transaction tx,
then every partyâs view will also include tx after a maximum
time bound. Therefore we need a time bound, â, which
bounds the maximum delay round trip time for a blockchain
transaction such that if a party P1 submits a transaction tx
at time T, then all parties have the same view of confirmed
transaction tx within time T + â.
Our choice of Ethereum as blockchain platform is due to
the following:

1) When party P1 closes the channel by sending a final
commitment and publishing the preimage Ď to CP reimage .
2) When party P2 closes the channel by publishing the latest
commitment it received to CP reimage .
3) Or in case of a dispute when one or both parties are
not in agreement of the latest state of the commitment.
Typically parties establish dispute resolution policies and
may employ a arbiter contract.
We denote a state channel between two parties P1 and P2
as

where party P1 makes a commitment to party P2 an action

publishing the preimage Ď of hash h = H(Ď) before time

3) Ethereum also provides a Turing-complete language called
Solidity which is used to write smart contracts.

4.

Smart contracts are programs which consist of data declarations and high-level functions. Users interact with a smart
contract by publishing a transaction containing a procedure
call, including the address of the contract, the name of the
function to invoke, and arguments to pass.
A user submits a transaction tx by paying a gas fee. The
gas price is the cost of executing the smart contract code on
Ethereum blockchain.

DECIBEL.LIVE ARCHITECTURE
I often say that when you can measure what you are
speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know
something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when
you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a
meagre and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of
knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced
to the stage of science, whatever the matter may be.

State Channels

While blockchains as distributed ledgers have proven to be
successful at low transaction volumes, scalability is a concern. As blocks are added to Ethereum blockchain every 12

4.1

Smartphone app

The Decibel.LIVE app is available for free and can be installed on GPS equipped smartphones. A beneficiary uses
Decibel.LIVE app to monitor noise and send noise events
in JSON format to the initiator over the secure Telehash
channel.

4.1.1

Gathering Noise Data

The Decibel.LIVE app collects five fields as shown in table 1 including benef iciaryId representing a beneficiary,
geolocation (lat, long) where noise sample was captured, the
noise level in dB(A) (db), and the time when the noise was
captured (timestamp). No additional information is captured.
The app measures the loudness level of the captured environmental sound at 22500 Hz, 16 bits/second at a chosen interval. The app contains a real-time signal processing
module which applies infinite impulse response (IIR) and
computes LAeq,T in dB(A) as the primary indicator of noise
pollution. IIR filters are used as they tend to mimic the
performance of traditional analog filters and make use of
feedback.
The app also takes into account two common noise indicators, Lnight and Lden which represent the equivalent sound
levels averaged over the night only (to assess sleep disturbance) and over the whole day, respectively.
These values on the A-weighted dB scale are used in the
payout settlement algorithm (see Algorithm 1).

4.1.2

Figure 2: Mesh network of secure channels connecting initiator, beneficiaries, and Preimage contract.

The dApp consists of a smart contract which we denote
here as CDecibelLive and a web based API5 to provide read
and write access to the contract.
There are four types of identities in the Decibel.LIVE
platform that interact with CDecibelLive contract â Initiator,
Beneficiary, Noise Smart Contract and Contract Monitor.

Storing Noise Data
4.2.1

Noise events collected on all secure channels are stored in
a local database and persisted on IPFS4 periodically. Events
are organized by noise contract and beneficiary:
/DecibelLIVE/{:deedId}/events/{:beneficiaryId}
At any time, payout settlement can be verified using the
noise events and policies in any noise contract CN oise even
after the contract becomes inactive.

4.2

Initiator

An initiator is an individual or business responsible for
the noise site. Every initiator is assigned a wallet within the
Decibel.LIVE platform. The wallet consists of a secret-key
sk, a public-key pk derived from the secret key, and unique
Ethereum address ainitiator = (pk, sk) constructed from the
public-key.
An initiator creates a smart contract for monitoring
noise at a noise site.

Contract Monitor

A monitor is a local authority that wishes to monitor noise
at a particular site in real time. A monitor is also assigned
a wallet consisting of a key pair and unique Ethereum address amonitor = (pk00 , sk00 ) constructed from the public-key.
However, a monitor is a read-only observer in the system.

// Refers to the initiator
InitiatingParty initiatingParty;

4.2.5 Bel token (Ă)
The DApp platform uses Bel token (Ă), an ERC20-compliant
token built on top of Ethereum, as the unit of compensation
on the blockchain-based platform. Within Decibel.LIVE,
initiators define compensation policies using Bel tokens.
A beneficiary receives compensation in the form of Bel
tokens. Bels can exchanged on a crypto currency exchange
or can be reused on the platform.
The distribution of Bels and the token supply is determined by a smart contract deployed on Ethereum.

// A dictionary of beneficiaries with
// beneficiaryIds as keys
mapping (bytes32 => BeneficiaryParty)
public beneficiaryParties;
// Store keys separately
bytes32[] beneficiaryIds;
// Current state of the contract
State public state;

4.2.6

Payout Policies

An initiator also declares incentives in the form of compensation when noise exceeds a certain threshold at certain
times during the day (or night) by hour(s) of day and day(s)
of week. Such payout policies are encapsulated in CN oise by
an initiator when a noise contract is created (see Table
2). When the contract becomes active, the policies can not
be changed.
The payout settlement algorithm (see Algorithm 1) evaluates every incoming noise event as per the payment policies
in a noise contract.

// payout policies per currency and base unit
// set in the deed
PayoutPolicy[] payoutPolicies;
An initiator creates a noise contract by filling out a contract template from the web or mobile application. The platform uses an implementation of smart contract templates[4]
to create and deploy noise contracts. In essence, CDecibelLive
uses a creational pattern and acts as a factory to create new
instances of CN oise on behalf of an initiator. Following
method in CDecibelLive creates a new noise contract.

4.2.7

State Channel

Decibel.LIVE uses Telehash7 , an encrypted mesh network
protocol for communication between the initiator and each
beneficiary. Telehash enables a completely distributed,
decentralized communication mechanism that doesnât rely
on on centralized or federated servers.
When a noise contract CN oise becomes active, the initiator
and every beneficiary of the contract is assigned a unique
Telehash address known as a hashname. A hashname is a
32-byte string that corresponds to the SHA-256 hash of one
or more public keys. A link or a channel is created connecting the initiator to every beneficiary of the contract. All
messages exchanged on a channel are encrypted end-to-end
all of the time using forward secrecy.
CP reimage creates a new channel on behalf of an initiator
with an opening balance of Ăb and hash h = H(Ď) where
Ď is secret chosen by the initiator. Ăb is the maximum
amount the initiator is willing to pay while the contract is
active. The beneficiary joins the channel after confirming
the owner of the channel using ecrecover function in Solidity.

Veracity of Data

The degree to which data is accurate and reliable is the
biggest challenge of the application. To that end, Decibel.LIVE aims to ensure high accuracy of sensor data and
low probability of incorrect inputs from a dishonest actor.

Compensation Settlement

The LAeq,T events are input into the payout settlement
algorithm (Algorithm 1). Each incoming event is checked
against the payout policies declared in the associated noise
contract. If an LAeq,T event is eligible for compensation, the
beneficiaryâs balance is updated on the channel in realtime.
When the contract expires, the balances on the channel
are published on CDecibelLive permanently recording transfer
of funds.

a) Joining the contract as beneficiaries when they
donât reside within the contract zone It is feasible
that individuals might try to temporarily position themselves within the approved contract zone for the purpose
of joining and thus benefiting from the contract. The
incentives for doing this are minimal given that the individual(s) would need to be present within the contract
zone for a reasonable amount of time to benefit in any
substantive way. However, this possibility does need to
be considered and will be mitigated through authentication i.e. pre-issuing a unique passcode to each nearby
resident which must be entered to join the contract.

b) Artificially distorting noise readings to increase
payouts Individuals might try to increase the noise readings through a variety of techniques like pre-recording
the noise closer to the sound source and playing it back,
generating another noise source within their residence,
blowing into the microphone on their smartphone to increase the sound pressure etc. These techniques will be
mitigated through sophisticated analysis of sound snippets (short duration audio recordings of < 1sec taken at
periodic intervals) for those noise readings that are identified as statistical outliers. Options such as banning the
user for the duration of the contract or a fixed period of
time (e.g. 30 days) may also be considered. It is eventually planned that much of this process will automated
using AI.

c) Joining the noise contract multiple times This will
be resolved by allowing each resident to join the contract
once only using pre-authentication techniques described
above. In addition, GPS locations for noise readings will
need to correspond to the beneficiaries location essentially eliminating the ability for a resident to join/monitor the contract on behalf of another nearby resident but
all from their within the bounds of their own residence.

4.3.2

Calibration

Prior to capturing noise levels, the smartphone app performs a set of calibrations. Data from an improperly calibrated smartphone is misleading and not useful. GPS modules in modern smartphones have a very high positioning
accuracy sufficient enough to calculate the distance from a
noise site. The app correlates GPS data with known information to determine the veracity of noise events.

5.

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we presented Decibel.LIVE, a noise monitoring and incentive platform which enables citizens monitor noise and report noise events to noise site owners on a
private encrypted channel. Site owners can define compensation policies based on the loudness of noise. Decibel.LIVE
helps citizens receive instant compensation from noise site
owners when noise exceeds thresholds defined by site owners.

1. Executive Summary
Decibel.​LIVE is a revolutionary noise monitoring platform that seeks to disrupt the noise
monitoring industry using blockchain-based smart contracts with verifiable results &
compensation direct to impacted parties.
Noise monitoring will be done at multiple GPS locations using our proprietary smartphone app
and also using our branded hardware solutions for fixed point monitoring locations.
Customers will be charged a monthly subscription fees, a commission (1%) on contract payouts
and also for hardware purchased. Other revenue is expected to come from local authorities for
monitoring data provided & advertising income.

The Decibel.​LIVE crowdsale will commence on the [TO BE ANNOUNCED] with a contribution
period of 14 days. Participants in the crowdsale will be issued with an Ethereum ERC20 token
designated ‘​BEL’​ at the rate of 5,000 BEL to 1 ETH (with a bonus allocation in the first 24 hours)..

We aim to be..
1.

The World’s #1 noise monitoring solution.

2. Extremely accurate.
3. Easy to use.
4. Recommended by happy customers.
5. Trusted.

2. Inspiration
Imagine a world where quiet existence is the norm. A world where your right to a quiet existence
is virtually guaranteed by instant financial disincentives to those whose behaviour exceeds
acceptable social parameters. These parameters vary by time of day, day of week or location and
are self-regulating.
Financial disincentives are levied instantly by smart contracts to those who partake in behaviour
‘outside the norm’ and then automatically redistributed to impacted parties as payments for loss
of quiet existence.

5

2.1 Why?
Noise, or unwanted sound, is one of the most common environmental exposures. For example, in
New York City noise is consistently the number one quality of life issue, and authorities there
received > 40,000 noise complaints in 2012 (Metcalfe 2013).
Excessive noise causes a wide variety of adverse health effects, including sleep disturbance,
cardiovascular disease, hearing loss, and increased incidence of diabetes (Passchier-Vermeer
and Passchier 2000; Sorensen et al. 2013).
The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends annual average night exposure should not
exceed 40 decibels (dB), corresponding to the sound from a quiet street in a residential area.
Persons regularly exposed to higher levels can suffer mild health effects, such as sleep
disturbance and insomnia and long-term exposure to levels above 55 dB, similar to the noise
from a busy street, can trigger elevated blood pressure and heart attacks (source: WHO website).

2.2 Noise Monitoring Today
Control of noise is predominantly the responsibility of local municipalities or authorities. Local
ordinances or bylaws generally include nuisance regulations. There is no consensus on what
should be included in a noise ordinance, therefore, noise control requirements vary widely across
the U.S and also in other regions of the world. Often, a typical local ordinance is vague and might
state, “It is unlawful for any person to make, or cause to be made any noise disturbance”
Actual quantitative sound level limits are imposed in some states, municipalities, councils and
authorities. For example the ordinance might state “The sound level at the boundary of a
residential receiving property resulting from the operation of a source on the emitter’s property
shall not exceed 45 dBA during nighttime”. Sometimes more detail regarding the method of
measure to determine compliance is provided, such as “The statistical median sound for a
one-hour period between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. shall not exceed 50 dBA.”

6

2.3 Problems we solve
1.

Response time - the response time can vary from a few hours of a complaint being
received, to days or even weeks. Often by the time the complaint(s) is followed up the
noise is not the nuisance it was at the time of complaint.

2. Bias - Often both sets of impacted parties employ consultants resulting in messy
arbitration or legal proceedings. Unless a mutually agreed noise consultant is engaged
then individual consultants may be tempted to skew results to favour the company or
individual(s) they are employed by.
3. Costs - local municipalities or authorities incur significant costs in administering noise
enforcement activities. Further, if noise control progresses to legal proceedings costs can
quickly escalate for all parties.
4. Reparation - impacted parties rarely receive any financial compensation for loss of quiet
enjoyment.

2.4 Our Solution
Decibel.​LIVE

INSTANT, DIRECT, FAIR

Decibel.LIVE will provide a mechanism where businesses or property owners can interact directly
with impacted parties (i.e. nearby residents or other businesses) thus creating a 'social contract’
providing financial compensation should pre-set conditions not be met. This will enhance the
reputation of the business and decrease the need for monitoring by local authorities,
enforcement agencies and/or noise consultants.

“A socially responsible company is one which realises that whilst it may not be able
to eliminate all noise generated, it can compensate those that are adversely
impacted by residual noise”
​ Shane Loomb, Co-Founder Decibel.LIVE

7

3. Value Proposition
3.1 Low Cost
Decibel.LIVE will be the most affordable noise monitoring solution in the market. Decibel.LIVE
contracts will be able to be initiated for a small monthly fee in contrast to current noise monitoring
which requires specialist equipment and acoustic consultants/engineers costing thousands (and
in some cases hundreds of thousands) of dollars. Often each party engage their own noise
consultant, whereas the Decibel.LIVE platform will enable parties to mutually agree on a noise
consultant or even completely avoid the need for a consultant by agreeing to use smartphone
monitoring and/or our branded noise monitoring hardware.

3.2 Live Monitoring
The Decibel.LIVE smartphone app will be free to download, easy to use and accurate to within 1.5
decibels (dB). Users will be able to see results in real time and given their involvement in the
monitoring process will have enhanced satisfaction with the outcome.

8

3.3 Instant Compensation
Impacted parties will receive instant financial compensation based on noise contract parameters.
Payments will be made direct to their online wallet in Decibel tokens (BEL’s) which will be able to
be easily converted into a range of different digital and traditional currency options.

3.4 Trusted Results Via Blockchain
Acoustic results are analysed and immutably stored using blockchain technology. These results
are cryptographically hashed then submitted hourly to the Ethereum blockchain and therefore
able to be verified by all interested parties.

3.5 Empowering
Decibel.LIVE will provide a mechanism where businesses or property owners/managers can
interact directly with impacted parties (i.e. nearby residents or other businesses) thus creating a
'social contract’ with financial compensation should conditions not be met. Impacted parties will
feel empowered using their smartphone to monitor the noise and with increased real-time
visibility of results & compensation will have greater tolerance of the offending noise.

4.1 Market Segments
Decibel.LIVE will target the following verticals through a combination of direct & relationship
marketing, with primary channels being online promotion & tradeshows.

EVENTS
Promoters of Concerts or Sporting events will be able to provide direct compensation to nearby
residents during for the exact dates that the event is held. Often these events are situated near
residential areas and attract numerous complaints during the course of the event. Decibel.LIVE
will provide a means for event promoters to compensate impacted parties during short duration
periods where noise exceeds acceptable limits, thus helping to ensure the long-term viability of
their event.

ACCOMMODATION
Hotels and apartment owners, using Decibel.LIVE will have a mechanism to control excessive
noise made by guests or residents. They will be able to charge residents or guests a bond which
will be used to fund a noise monitoring contract with the owners or other guests/residents
stipulated as beneficiaries. If maximum noise levels in the Hotel or Apartment are not exceeded,
the guest or resident is automatically reimbursed their full bond amount. If the noise limits are
exceeded, payments are automatically made to other guests or directly back to the owners. We
envisage this service will be beneficial to AirBnB providers who will be able to ensure that their
guests adhere to a reasonable level of behaviour.

11

CONSTRUCTION
Construction/demolition companies are able to operate during business hours but need to be
cognisant of minimising excessive noise. There are periods where due to time constraints these
companies would value the opportunity to extend their working hours. Decibel.LIVE provides a
means to provide compensation to those impacted by this noise during heavy construction.

MANUFACTURING
Manufacturing plants will be able to provide compensation to nearby residents, other business
owners or even employees for noise that is above acceptable limits.

HOSPITALITY
Restaurants & Bars will be able to select specific time bands in the evening and even specific
days of the week, providing compensation to nearby residents for the short time period that they
may be considered a nuisance (i.e. 11pm-1am).

TRANSPORT
Airports, Train Stations & Roading Companies will be able to provide compensation to residents
or businesses that are near hub operations or impacted along movement routes. We intend to
develop an API for airports to automatically generate contracts specific to each airline and flight
arrival/departure.

12

4.2 ‘Go-to Market’ Strategy
Following the successful completion of our crowdsale, the Decibel.LIVE website will be modified
to better promote the merits of our product. There will be options to select a subscription plan,
create an account and generate noise monitoring contracts instantly. The website will also
provide tips & suggestions for business owners on how to reach out to their impacted parties
(beneficiaries).
We have first-mover advantage in this new sector of the noise monitoring market and our
customers will also have a first-mover advantage and the opportunity to attract favorable PR. Our
approach to market will be to target the following verticals through a combination of direct
marketing, online marketing, strategic partnerships, and commission-based sales representatives.
1.

2.
3.

4.

5.
6.

ACCOMMODATION - ​strategic partnerships through initially approaching AirBnB but also
smaller accommodation websites offering a commission payment on subscription sales or
hardware sales (Decibel.LIVE noise monitoring hardware which will retail at $49). We will
also approach property developers & hotel chains using a combination of business
development & commission-based sales force.
EVENTS​ - approach event organizers directly or using commission-based sales force.
CONSTRUCTION ​- make construction/demolition companies aware that offering a
Decibel.LIVE noise solution in their tender documents could give them a competitive
advantage, particularly in tenders for local or federal/central government jobs. We will
also consider offering companies who are 'early adopters' an exclusivity for 6/12 months
over their competitors for a restricted geographic region to help gain traction.
HOSPITALITY - advertise the benefits of our service in relevant publications & via a direct
commission-based sales force. The benefits to the hospitality industry are in staying open
later and minimising/mitigating complaints.
MANUFACTURING -​ ​target manufacturing operations near residential areas again via a
commission-based sales force.
TRANSPORT -​ ​establish strategic partnerships with airports then move into other
transport sectors. We will develop API’s to enable airports to load take-off or arrival times
into our software which will automatically create time-specific contracts for each airline
thus initiating compensation payments excessive noise from low flight paths etc.

5. Revenue Projections
Decibel.LIVE will launch in Q1 2018. Our sales forecast is demonstrated by the chart below.

Revenue is generated from subscriptions, commissions, advertising revenue & hardware sales.
●

Subscriptions – charges per month for Bronze $9 (1 site), Silver $19 (2-5 sites), Gold $29
(6-10 sites), Platinum $49, (11-50 sites) & POA (51+ sites).

●

Commission​ – 1% of all contract payouts to beneficiaries.

●

Advertising​ -- display advertising on wallet pages for beneficiaries.

●

Hardware -- a Decibel.LIVE noise monitoring device is currently under development that
will be marketed to property owners. It will contain a microphone, GPS & bluetooth
transmitter and installed similar to a smoke detector.

14

15

6. How Decibel.​LIVE​ works
6.1 Contract Setup
The business (or agent for the noise offender) or property owner/manager visits the Decibel.LIVE
website or smartphone app to initiate the contract. Key information collected will be the address
of the noise site (used to establish GPS position) and maximum allowable noise readings in
Decibels (dB) by timezone throughout day.
The contract initiator will have the option to stipulate if they would like noise readings monitored
by users of the Decibel.LIVE smartphone app, the Decibel.LIVE noise meter, or an external noise
consultant. If a consultant is selected the business will nominate a proposed consultant from a list
of recommended consultants on the Decibel.LIVE website. If there are no consultants listed for
their geographic region the default will be smartphone app monitoring. If there is more than one
consultant for their area the business will be required to nominate a minimum of 2 consultants,
with the consultant selected by popular vote.

16

6.2 Registration Of Interested Parties
Once the contract is initiated it is listed as an active contract. Nearby residents will be able to
request to be added to the contract and a notification automatically sent to the contract Initiator.
If the resident is within the specified proximity of the business they will be automatically added as
a 'Beneficiary' to the contract (or the business may require a unique code be entered by the
resident to join the contract)3. Requests which come from outside the specified proximity zone
(i.e. from a local authority for access to 'Monitor' the contract) must be approved by the contract
Initiator. If the contract involves an external noise consultant they will be added by the contract
Initiator with 'Collector' status. This status will also be automatically applied to residents under the
smartphone app option in addition to their status in the contract as a Beneficiary.
●
●
●
●

Initiator - business owner (or agent)
Beneficiary - resident (or other parties impacted by noise)
Monitor - local authority (or other enforcement agency)
Collector - data provider (either noise consultants or smartphone app users)

3

Note: In the case of Airbnb and property owners it is anticipated that the contract will be initiated at the
time of booking with the bond being used to fund the contract and the property owner/manager listed as
the beneficiary under the contract

17

6.3 Noise Data Collection
Noise data collection can commence at any time but only becomes live once the contract start
date is reached. Data will initially be verified using a tolerance algorithm on a separate state
channel to minimise calculations that need to be performed within the smart contract thus
minimising gas costs. Data which is over tolerance (i.e. readings exceed decibel parameters set
by the project Initiator for the time of day) will be will be sent through to the smart contract to
initiate payments to Beneficiaries. All readings, regardless of if they trigger a payout will be
cryptographically hashed and sent to the contract each hour for subsequent verification.

6.4 Payouts
Payouts will be made instantly to contract beneficiaries in Decibel tokens (BEL’s). The DApp
platform uses a BEL token (​ß​), an ERC20-compliant token built on top of Ethereum, as the unit of
compensation on the blockchain-based platform. BEL’s can exchanged on a cryptocurrency
exchange or can be reused on the platform. The distribution of BEL’s and the token supply is
determined by a smart contract deployed on Ethereum. Beneficiaries will have an online wallet
where they will be credited with payouts from smart contracts. They will then have a number of
options for transferring or converting their tokens in other digital currencies or fiat currency.

18

7. Platform Architecture
C​DecibelLive creates and deploys new noise smart contracts on behalf of initiators. A noise contract
which we denote as C​Noise encapsulates information about the noise site such as the location
(latitude and longitude coordinates) and Ethereum addresses of ​N beneficiaries a​1 beneficiary...a​N
beneficiary confirmed by Decibel.LIVE as residents living within an area of radius r ​meters from
the noise site.

Decibel.LIVE uses Telehash, an encrypted mesh network protocol for communication between
the initiator and each beneficiary. Telehash enables a completely distributed, decentralized
communication mechanism that doesn’t rely on on centralized or federated servers. When a
noise contract C​Noise becomes active, the initiator and every beneficiary of the contract is
assigned a unique Telehash address known as a hashname. A hashname is a 32-byte string that
corresponds to the SHA-256 hash of one or more public keys. A link or a channel is created
connecting the initiator to every beneficiary of the contract. All messages exchanged on a
channel are encrypted end-to-end all of the time using forward secrecy. CP reimage creates a
new channel on behalf of an initiator with an opening balance of ßb and hash h = H(σ) where σ
is secret chosen by the initiator. ßb is the maximum amount the initiator is willing to pay while the
contract is active. The beneficiary joins the channel after confirming the owner of the channel
using ​erecover​ function in Solidity.

For more information on our architecture please refer to our technical paper available
on our website.

7.1 System Architecture
Decibel.​LIVE platform uses cloud infrastructure in multiple geographically distributed datacenters
for high availability and to achieve 99.99% uptime. We use Docker based microservices
architecture for fast and reliable deployments and code pipelines for automated image
deployments.
The platform provides a web application, an Android smartphone app and an iOS smartphone
app. Customers can use either web application or the mobile application to create new noise
contracts, join new contracts, view reports on noise levels and purchase or transfer BEL tokens.
19

Figure 7.1 System Architecture

The platform uses overlay networks on virtual machines to ensure privacy and data integrity.
Cloud based infrastructure ensures that we can scale microservices up or down as needed to
meet the demand and to keep initial setup costs as low as possible.

used to make decisions on proposals, which can be made by any token holder.
Decentralizing our governance needs to happen over time, given the sheer complexity of the
task. It is not something we intend to develop ourselves so we are closely monitoring the
progress of decentralized governance projects in the space including Aragon, Boardroom, and
Colony.
In the short term key decisions, including the spending of funds will require 3 out of 5 signatures
from a multisig account where funds from the crowdsale will be held. Initial signatories will be the
team & advisors (refer pg 22) with an additional signatory to be added from a reputable source
(‘Custodian’).
The custodian will monitor the usage of the digital tokens and share it with the community
periodically.

13. Disclaimers
Decibel.LIVE is not a cryptocurrency.
At the time of this writing, Decibel.LIVE tokens ‘BEL’s: (i) cannot be exchanged for goods or services, (ii) have no known
uses outside the Decibel.LIVE network, and (iii) cannot be traded on any known exchanges, although it is expected
they will be traded on exchanges in the future..
Decibel.LIVE is not an investment.
There is no guarantee that your BEL tokens will increase in value.
Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol
Decibel.LIVE is based upon the Ethereum protocol. As such, any malfunction, unintended function or unexpected
functioning of the Ethereum protocol may cause the Decibel.LIVE network or Decibel tokens to malfunction or function
in an unexpected or unintended manner. Ether, the native unit of account of the Ethereum Protocol may itself lose
value in ways similar to Decibel tokens, and also other ways. More information about the Ethereum protocol is available
at​ http://www.ethereum.org​.
Risks Associated with Purchaser Credentials
Any third party that gains access to the purchaser’s private keys may be able to dispose of the purchaser’s Decibel
tokens. To minimize this risk, the purchaser should guard against unauthorized access to their electronic devices.
Risk of Unfavourable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions
Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. The
functioning of the Decibel.LIVE network and Decibel tokens could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or
actions, including but not limited to restrictions on the use or possession of digital tokens like the Decibel tokens,
which could impede or limit the development of the Decibel.LIVE network.
Risk of Alternative, Unofficial Decibel.LIVE Networks
Following the sale and the development of the initial version of the Decibel.LIVE platform, it is possible that alternative
competing networks could be established, which utilize the same or similar code and functionality and are on the same
network. The official Decibel.LIVE network may compete with these alternative, competing networks, which could
potentially negatively impact the Decibel.LIVE network and Decibel tokens.
Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Decibel.LIVE Network or Distributed Applications
It is possible that the Decibel.LIVE network will not be used by a large number of businesses, individuals, and other
organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications.
Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the Decibel.LIVE network and therefore the potential uses or
value of the Decibel token.
Risk that the Decibel.LIVE Network, As Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of Token Holders
The Decibel.LIVE network is presently under development and may undergo significant changes before release. Any
expectations regarding the form and functionality of Decibel.LIVE held by the donor may not be met upon release, for
any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the Decibel.LIVE
network.

29

Risk of Theft and Hacking
Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Decibel.LIVE network or the availability of
Decibel tokens in any number of ways, including without limitation denial of service attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing,
smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus-​based attacks.
Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Decibel.LIVE network Core Infrastructure Software
The Decibel.LIVE network consists of open-​source software that is itself based on open​-source software. There is a risk
that the Decibel.LIVE team, or other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs
into the core infrastructural elements of the Decibel.LIVE network interfering with the use of or causing the loss of
Decibel tokens.
Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography
Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks
to cryptocurrencies and the Decibel.LIVE platform, which could result in the theft or loss of Decibel tokens.
Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the Decibel.LIVE Network
While Decibel tokens should not be viewed as an investment, it may have value over time. That value may be limited if
the Decibel.LIVE network lacks use and adoption. If this becomes the case, there may be few or no markets upon the
launch of the platform, limiting the value of Decibel tokens.
Risk of an Illiquid Market for Decibel tokens
There is a risk that the Decibel token will be illiquid on whatever exchanges they are traded on resulting in large price
fluctuations or the inability to buy and sell tokens.
Risk of Uninsured Losses
Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, funds held using the Decibel.LIVE or Ethereum
network are generally uninsured. In the event of loss or loss of value, there is no public insurer, such as the F.D.I.C., or
private insurer, to offer recourse to the purchaser.
Risk of Dissolution of the Decibel.LIVE Project
It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including without limitation an unfavourable fluctuation in the value of
Bitcoin or Ethereum, unfavourable fluctuation in the value of Decibel tokens, the failure of business relationships, or
competing intellectual property claims, the Decibel.LIVE project may no longer be a viable project and may dissolve or
fail to launch.
Risk of Malfunction in the Decibel.LIVE Network
It is possible that the Decibel.LIVE network malfunctions in an unfavourable way, including but not limited to one that
results in the loss of Decibel tokens, or information concerning a market.
Unanticipated Risks
Cryptocurrency and cryptographic tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks set forth here,
there are risks that the Decibel.LIVE team cannot anticipate. Risks may further materialize as unanticipated
combinations or variations of the risks set forth here.

Summary
A rapid increase in connectivity via technologies such as the internet, social networking and
smartphones has brought about a step-change in our ability to communicate. At the same time,
current audio and video calling software and instant messaging are insecure and prone to
surveillance and exploitation by governments, corporations and malicious third parties, as well as
being less efficient and cost-effective than might be expected.
EncryptoTel will combine the most promising technologies and markets in the telecommunications

1

sector, linking a virtual PBX (private branch exchange) with encryption, blockchain protocols and
cryptocurrency payments to offer significant improvements in performance, functionality and
competitive advantage. We believe this will enable us to become a leader in the PBX industry, with
a diverse platform suitable for both individual use and office/business applications.
We have already completed a working beta of our core software that is actively being tested. The
EncryptoTel application will ultimately be a multiplatform solution that enables users to connect
and make VoIP calls using any device (desktop or Android SIP, Zoiper, 3CXPhone, X-Lite and more),
and gain access to their PBX via popular messaging apps such as Telegram and Facebook
Messenger.
This white paper details the scope and vision of EncryptoTel ahead of our crowdsale in May 2017.
In the coming months we will be completing and launching our product, and making a gradual
entrance into the global PBX market. The EncryptoTel token (ticker: ETT) will be the native currency
for our services, offering discounts and other advantages, though it will also be possible to pay
using other cryptocurrencies.

Context
We enjoy an unprecedented level of connectivity. Before the rise of the internet, 25 years ago,
communication at a distance was costly and time-consuming. Even local phone calls incurred
charges; national calls could be costly during peak times, and international calls prohibitively so for
most people. Written communication by letter entailed a delivery time of at least a day, again at a
cost. Sending a letter by Airmail typically meant a round trip of over a week.
Twenty years ago, as mainstream consumers first began to access the web, email was considered
analogous to sending a letter due to the costs of using a dial-up connection. Bandwidth was limited
and relatively expensive. It was not until the advent of ubiquitous broadband that we reached a
tipping point. Audio and video calling over the internet – the ability to communicate in real-time
and at the fixed cost of the connection – became possible and rapidly accessible for the first time,
popularised by applications such as Skype, which was founded in 2003. Alongside this, social
networking quickly became established, and with it the opportunity to communicate on a one-tomany and many-to-many basis with an ease that has been unparalleled in human history.
The mass adoption of the smartphone, which began no more than ten years ago, completed the
now-clear picture of the ‘Always-On’ culture. We can communicate with anyone, anywhere in the
2

world, through a range of media including voice and video calls, instant text and picture messaging,
individually or in groups, using a range of devices and for essentially zero marginal cost.

‘The Internet is the most liberating tool for humanity ever invented, and also the best for
surveillance. It’s not one or the other. It’s both.’
– John Perry Barlow, cyber rights activist

This remarkable serious of technological and cultural step-changes has resulted in opportunities
that few would have imagined possible in previous generations: new methods and patterns of
working, new structures of business and shifting social norms. But alongside the advantages there
have arisen new risks, and the pervasive nature of the Always-On culture means we are often illequipped to recognise and mitigate these. Connectivity is so much a part of life that we rarely
question it.

The surveillance society
In an environment of such ubiquitous connectivity and communication, data has become
extremely valuable. Huge amounts of personal information are now routinely harvested by a range
of different actors, including state-backed organisations, corporations and hackers. Whilst each of
these have their own motivations, the line between them is frequently blurred. State-sponsored
hacking is becoming commonplace, as in the case of the North Korea-instigated hack of Sony
Pictures in 2014, in which personal information about employees, their families and the company
was released, including emails, information about salaries and even unpublished films. Data held
by the state and corporations may be hacked or leaked, by insiders or by malicious external parties,
and occasionally released inadvertently through oversight and incompetence.

‘Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no
different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.’
– Edward Snowden, NSA whistleblower

3

In 2015, it became public that Samsung’s smart TV could be used as a listening device;1 documents
made available by Wikileaks showed that the CIA intended to exploit this capability for a number
of similar devices.2 This is ostensibly being carried out in the name of national security, but the
very fact of the leak proves that any data collected is also prone to loss and abuse. Similar
strategies will doubtless be used by hackers as new techniques and vulnerabilities are made
known. High-profile hacks of large organisations demonstrate that the standards of security are
frequently inadequate, with lists of millions of plaintext user emails, passwords, addresses, social
security numbers and more dumped on the web.3 Repeated scandals involving celebrity photos
have arisen from cloud storage being compromised, either through poor implementation or user
error.
The reality is that in a hyper-connected world, data is not safe. We inevitably trust our personal
data to the applications we use and the organisations that own and host them. We are often
complacent about our personal security. Re-use of passwords and email addresses; carelessness
about signing up for new services with social media accounts; lack of understanding or disregard
about what happens to our data: all of these are habitual. More than this, there is an implicit
collusion that our personal data is the price of using ‘free’ platforms and applications. Corporations
collect extensive data about their customers, typically with little oversight or explicit permission
from users. This information may be stored insecurely, and may be sold or otherwise made
available to third parties.
It is our position that privacy is an important and fundamental right for every person. Freedom of
speech is a critical check on the accumulation of power, and the ability to communicate freely
without fear of surveillance – whether state-backed, corporate or by malicious individuals – is a
pre-requisite for wider societal and personal freedoms. In the information age, knowledge truly is
power. Data can be and routinely is used for profit or otherwise to the advantage of entities whose
values are not aligned with those who involuntarily provide their personal information.

Content and metadata
It is widely accepted that the content of unencrypted communications – the text, audio and video

1 https://www.cnet.com/uk/how-to/samsung-smart-tv-spying/
2 http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/wikileaks-smart-tv-surveillance-1202003656/
3 See for example https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/09/plaintext-passwords-and-wealth-of-other-data-for-6-6million-people-go-public/

4

material – is monitored, wholesale, by state-backed agencies and other organisations. In many
cases this will remain a passive process, save for when specific information is sought and trigger
words found. In other cases, the authorities will engage directly to block access to a platform or
subvert discussion – a well-known strategy employed by the Chinese government, which is
believed to fake hundreds of millions of social media posts per year.4
However, as strong encryption becomes more widely available and popular, new techniques have
been developed to enable effective surveillance. So-called metadata becomes increasingly
important: not the content of what is being communicated, but information pertaining to those
communications: date, time, type of contact (phone call, email, social media post, video/audio
call), location of participants, duration of calls, and any other data provided by apps during their
usage. In some cases, there will be financial information that can be acquired, such as data
concerning credit card transactions.
Whilst individuals may rightly be concerned about freedom of speech and financial privacy, for
businesses the issue becomes acute. Even if the content of a communication remains private,
financial records can uncover critical information that can be used by competitors for industrial
espionage. Companies, suppliers, employees, contractors and customers are all connected by an
intricate web of transactions. Any leaked information can (and inevitably will) be used to the
advantage of competitors and malicious third parties.
In the early 1990s, when the Cypherpunk movement began to advocate the use of strong
encryption in the interests of protecting financial privacy, concerns about state-sponsored
surveillance and corporate control of information, few of even the most forward-thinking critics
grasped the sheer volume and breadth of data we would transmit and need to protect a quarter of
a century later.
EncryptoTel will launch a suite of tools that will enable user-friendly and secure communication, by
combining existing applications and technologies with custom-built new ones. Privacy is a right,
but it is one that must be exercised actively and deliberately.

Background and Vision
EncryptoTel’s vision is to realise an open, reliable and above all secure means of communication
4 https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/05/19/the-chinese-government-fakes-nearly-450million-social-media-comments-a-year-this-is-why/?utm_term=.09a5c955eb20

that can be used regardless of the users’ locations. The company’s main product is a flexible and
comprehensive PBX service – that is, an internal private network that can be shared by a large
number of users, but one that can also interface with the external telecommunications network.

PBX and IPPBX
A private branch exchange (PBX) is an internal telephone exchange or switching system used
within a single office or organisation.
The chief benefits of a PBX are cost and convenience. Using an internal system allows employees to
communicate directly without requiring the use and expense of external telephone lines. Outgoing
calls by a large number of employees may be shared on just a few lines. Meanwhile, additional
services can be integrated with the switching system, such as routing calls to intercoms and other
destinations.
Some form of PBX is now the norm for businesses, particularly in large organisations, where it is
unnecessary and inefficient to rent many external lines. Internet protocol PBX (IPPBX) systems
adopt the same approach as the older traditional PBX, with the difference that they use computers
and existing internet infrastructure to route calls within an organisation. This allows for greater
efficiencies and versatility, since digital facilities can be integrated with the telephone system –
including message storage and connection to voice-over-IP (VoIP) services – while still using a
limited number of lines to interface with the external telephone network. Since almost every
business is connected to the internet and uses high-speed broadband infrastructure, IPPBX offers
substantial advantages at a low cost overhead when compared to legacy telecommunications
systems.
EncryptoTel will offer a virtual IPPBX, as well as easy integration of encrypted VoIP into existing
IPPBX networks.

We want to offer this service regardless of whether our customers are a single individual or a large
corporation with many thousands of employees. Our software and underpinning blockchain
infrastructure allows us to provide for the needs of anyone, regardless of scale, thanks to the

6

economies it offers in micro-transactions and in decentralising operations. Without blockchain
technology, EncryptoTel’s proposition would simply not be economically viable.
The idea for EncryptoTel is rooted in the development Team’s experiences of working for a
telecommunications company. Familiarity with both traditional telecommunications infrastructure
and blockchain technology raised the possibility of creating a product that was superior to
anything currently on the market. The Team has worked full-time on the project for several months
and has a public beta application. A crowdsale will provide the funds to finish the product to a high
standard and market it properly.

The opportunity for EncryptoTel
The Telecoms market is currently one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy. Whilst the
legacy telephone system is seeing reduced usage, new internet-based technologies are rapidly
expanding, offering significant benefits of cost and convenience over older approaches. It is now
possible to communicate by video chat via Skype, Facebook Messenger and many other platforms
using only a smartphone, and at no greater cost than that of the internet connection.

‘The telecom sector continues to be a critical force for growth, innovation, and disruption across
multiple technology industries.’
– Deloitte5

‘Global demand for VoIP services market was valued at over USD 83 billion in 2015, is expected to
reach above USD 140 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of above 9.1% between
2016 and 2021.’6 Due to their efficiencies and use of now-ubiquitous broadband infrastructure,
VoIP services have the potential to drive traditional calls via both landline and mobile telephones
out of the market.

The closest analogue to EncryptoTel would be a company that provides a Virtual PBX service, as
EncryptoTel will offer, and be able to sell phone numbers for users anywhere in the world.
Companies that do so currently have to collect and disclose customer information when required
by regulators. Additionally, no PBX company accepts cryptocurrency payments and leverages
blockchain technology for their underlying infrastructure. At the present time this means that
EncryptoTel has no direct competitors and offers a unique approach and package of services.
Having worked in the PBX sector, EncryptoTel’s Team is familiar with the products that exist on the
market, has conducted extensive research and has collected feedback from customers about the
major problems with current PBX systems. The Team’s combined experience will be applied to
creating a new product that is more flexible and wide-ranging than anything currently available,
circumventing or solving the drawbacks that exist in mainstream telecommunications systems and
offering many new features. The result of the work to date is an application that enables:


Private communication



Fast deployment of fully-fledged PBX



Reduction in call costs to external lines



Absolutely free and extremely secure communication within the network



Ability to pay with cryptocurrency
8



Additional transparency of control and monitoring due to the nature of blockchain
technology.

EncryptoTel’s approach avoids all of the existing disadvantages of virtual PBX systems, and adds
unique new features. In terms of payment, the use of cryptocurrency offers for the first time
genuinely anonymous access to the service. As a result of this collection of features, EncryptoTel
stands apart from any existing virtual PBX service, holds a number of competitive advantages, and
has the potential to occupy a significant fraction of the market.

Platform and technology
As a virtual PBX, EncryptoTel is designed to be highly accessible to its customers. It will not require
any telecommunications infrastructure above an internet-connected device (smartphone, tablet,
laptop, desktop). Office equipment such as telephones are not necessary, though these can be
connected to the service via a VoIP gateway if desired. Any modern PC can serve this purpose,
since it is simply a matter of interfacing the IP network with the regular telephone network.

Multiplatform, unified approach
EncryptoTel takes a multiplatform approach and can be used with Windows, Linux, iOS and
Android. It supports video and audio calls, as well as instant messaging. Numerous free apps can
be used with EncryptoTel, such as Zoiper, X-Lite and 3CXphone. These are also multiplatform
‘softphone’ apps that make audio and video calls over the internet, rather than requiring dedicated
hardware. The aim is to make EncryptoTel as versatile and accessible as possible, reducing the
frictions to getting started with the service to near zero. In due course we will integrate
EncryptoTel with other popular messaging apps including Facebook Messenger and Skype.

Call encryption
The beta version of EncryptoTel already offers traffic encryption based on SIP/TLS technologies.
This ensures that a basic level of encryption is set up when a client-server connection is established
in order to avert interception and unauthorised access.
EncryptoTel is currently working on the development of its own secure connection network, which
is based on two network contours (internal and external), and which includes several elements

9

including certification authority, organisation of VPN, distributed encrypted file system, HTTPS
server, and so on. The company will implement its own security protocols using certificate
encryption based on blockchain protocols.

User experience
Due to its integration with existing softphone applications, the EncryptoTel user experience will be
seamless. Customers who use popular apps like Zoiper will continue to use them in the same way,
with the difference that the apps will be integrated with EncryptoTel’s software and all of their calls
encrypted.

Pseudonymous payments
As explained above, maintaining privacy is not simply a matter of encrypting the content of a call
or other communication. If metadata is available then this can be used to glean valuable
information about the nature, purpose and participants of a call. Financial transactions are
particularly valuable in this regard, since they are generally linked to a credit card or bank account,
offering extensive personal data. Cryptocurrency payments will address this flaw in current PBX
systems.
Most cryptocurrencies are not strictly anonymous, but pseudonymous. Addresses are essentially
random strings of alphanumeric characters. The blockchain is transparent and it is possible to see
where money is moving, tracing transactions back to their source. However, without additional
information it is impossible to see who those addresses are associated with.
In reality, poor practice on the part of users can leak information and means it is often possible to
glean data about who is transacting. Nevertheless, it is quite possible to ensure privacy through
best practice. Further services such as mixers radically increase the complexity and cost of tracing
transactions. Privacy-centric altcoins such as Dash and Monero provide yet further facilities for
protecting the identities of cryptocurrency holders.
EncryptoTel will make it straightforward for users to pay for its services with cryptocurrency, so
that not only will it be impossible to know what is being communicated, but also who is
communicating. For existing cryptocurrency users, there will be an external plug-in to enable calls
directly from the Waves lite client to allow easy payments.

10

Functionality offered by EncryptoTel
The following services and more will be offered by EncryptoTel. These will be charged on a
subscription or per-call basis, with discounts offered for payments with the EncryptoTel token
(ETT).


Call redirection. Ability to redirect an incoming call to another phone number. Example:
The user can redirect calls to a local number, or to multiple local numbers based on who is
calling and when.



Two-factor authentication (2FA). An additional layer of protection will be offered for
services such as exchanges and crypto-wallets. Example: In addition to username-password
login, users will receive a call, text message or other authentication details before access is
granted.



Encryption and traffic protection. Traffic is reliably encrypted and protected with the latest
encryption protocols. Example: For instances such as important business negotiations or
for individuals concerned about privacy for any reason, this functionality will protect data
from audio interception and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.



Free communication. Every subscriber will receive a free internal number for the network.
Example: Talk within a network, one-on-one or with a group, free of charge.



Hide a phone number. Phone numbers used for outgoing calls will be masked from
detection by a receiving device. Example: Conduct negotiations and other communication
without revealing your direct subscriber’s number.



Scenario execution. This makes it possible to create scenarios that are executed via
SMS/MMS and calls. Example: Users can send cryptocurrency to predetermined address by
calling a designated number and entering a pin-code via their phone’s keypad.



Multiplatformity. EncryptoTel can be used with all operating systems, IP-phones and
gateways. Example: Users will have access to deployment and control of their PBX via any
device – mobile terminal, desktop workstation, tablet, etc.



Conversation recording and data storage. Recordings of conversations or other important
data can be securely stored. Example: Optionally turn on storage for all negotiations and
files. This stored data can only be decrypted by the owner using EncryptoTel’s integrated
11

blockchain technology.


Call tracking. Monitor traffic resources. Example: It is possible to create a unique number
for every advertisement resource. Statistics can be downloaded and progress monitored
from the user’s account.



IVR (interactive voice response). Voice recognition facilities. Example: Create pre-recorded
instructions for people who call you, optimising processing for incoming calls.



Video call. Face-to-face calling. Example: Call someone using a camera or begin a live tocamera broadcast.



Reminders. Synchronise your app with your calendar. Example: Prompt reminders for
important events via call or SMS.



API. Interact with the EncryptoTel service on the back-end level. Example: Integrate your
CRM or another system with EncryptoTel’s PBX and gain access to all its services, with the
opportunity to build new facilities on top of it.



AI and text interaction. Perform basic set-up and control for popular messengers using
EncryptoTel’s artificial intelligence bot. Example: Initialize a call via Telegram, XMPP/Jabber
client with the help of a simple message, such as ‘Call the number +1 … 1 from the USA
zone number, then call me back on the number +1 … 2’.

Revenue generation and return-on-investment
EncryptoTel will charge users for certain services on either a subscription or pay-as-you-go basis,
depending on the customer’s preference. Sales and revenues statistics will be clearly visible thanks
to the transparency of the blockchain.
We will be occupying the telecommunications market among cryptocurrency and blockchain
companies within a year, and will attract a large number of individual users by means of low tariffs,
broad functionality and an aggressive advertising policy. Having established a presence we will
consolidate and expand this amongst regular users and large companies alike.
ETT tokens will be sold during EncryptoTel’s crowdfund. Although different cryptocurrencies will be
used, ETT will bring discounts over other currencies, placing it in demand as a way of paying for
services. Rising demand from end users will increase the price.

12

Subscription vs per-minute charging
We want to make EncryptoTel a flexible service that allows customers to pay however they want.
We will initially offer two payment structures.
1. Pre-paid tariff. This will be a fixed monthly amount suitable for customers such as
businesses that make large volumes of calls every month. This can come with a discount on
a direct number and additional options such as IVR, answerphone, call tracking, and so on.
2. Pay as you go. This will entail making calls at the standard price, so long as your account
has sufficient funding. Customers will always be able to make secure calls within their PBX
network for free.
Aside from direct buy pressure on the native ETT token as a means of securing discounted services,
revenues from other payments will be distributed to investors on a regular basis. The easiest way
to achieve this would be via a regular dividend, but this would incur regulatory complications. A
similar way to achieve the same ends is to make a periodic buy-back of the ETT token from
supporting exchanges, and then burn it, reducing available supply and driving up the price.

Voting rights
Aside from offering a discount over other payment methods, ETT will enable holders to have a
voice in the running of the company. Holders will be able to vote on key strategic decisions, albeit
in an advisory rather than legally binding capacity.

Funding milestones
EncryptoTel has already completed a working beta version of their product (see
www.EncryptoTel.com), with several of its core features implemented. Further funding is required
to finish development and market the result. EncryptoTel has outlined a series of budgets that we
project will enable us to complete different scenarios:
1. $100,000+. This would allow us to create a fully-functional commercial product that could
compete in the global PBX market. Funds raised above this milestone would be spent
improving stability, implementing new encryption methods and redesigning the user
experience for greater accessibility.
2. $250,000+. Realisation of EncryptoTel’s own traffic encryption protocol based on blockchain
13

technology. This would include the release of mobile applications for Android and iOS for
safe and easy communication within a PBX.
3. $1,000,000+. This would enable EncryptoTel’s penetration of the international market with
an aggressive policy of expansion, allowing us to occupy a more significant fraction of the
telecommunications industry, including entry into PBX models that are already configured
and customised for the most common tasks in the B2B, B2C and B2G sectors. It would allow
us to acquire the necessary licences to allow us to provide customers with
telecommunications services and allocate numbers to them ourselves.

EncryptoTel Team
The EncryptoTel Team has extensive experience in the fields of blockchain technology, SIP
telephony and cloud PBX development.
Every member of the Team has worked in telecommunications and its associated technologies for a
minimum of six years and have together been involved in far-reaching projects – including the
creation of information systems from scratch. They are experts in every aspect of the digital
currency world, from mining to blockchain integration. The Team used to work together for the
same telecommunications company, and its members have known each other for more than five
years. It was during their time working together that they realised they could revolutionise the
digital market for IPPBX systems.
EncryptoTel has already built a working beta product that can be tested by prospective customers
and investors. The Team has previous participated in the realisation of a number of projects across
the areas required for successful implementation and launch of EncryptoTel, including the creation
of billing systems, softphone and multifunctional ERP systems. Moreover, they have sound
experience in the integration of these systems into the business process.
EncryptoTel has already spent considerable time and resources in designing their core product and
completing a working beta. The Team’s experience will help them to address any issue that arises
during the implementation process, and they have the track record to make such a complicated
project a success.

Introduction
Cryptocurrency, specifically Blockchain, has been proven to be a groundbreaking technology in
society today, yet it is still in the early stages of adoption. Consequently, many new
cryptocurrency concepts are being marketed to bridge the gap between technical complexity
and usability of Blockchain.
The potential in this growing market along with increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies
makes new projects extremely appealing for start-ups and investors alike. The market for
cryptocurrencies is not fully realized. Simply trading cryptocurrency can be a burden for many
potential users due to security concerns and identity verification difficulties.
Having easy-to-use, secure cryptocurrency technology that integrates P2P exchange between
fiat and cryptocurrency, credit card capability, and cold, secure storage of user funds while
providing novice users techniques to improve their skills is the future of safe trading and
exchange of assets. Providing users with a return on gross profits serves as an additional
enticement.
We are ETHBITS with a successful trading platform at www.ethbits.com and we are presenting
an opportunity for investors to participate in a Token Crowdsale for our new social trading
platform – iTrade.

Meet ETHBITS
Easy-to-use, secure cryptocurrency with a future-minded organization - that’s where ETHBITS
comes into play, as a trustworthy and secure alternative exchange that allows users to easily
convert fiat into any cryptocurrency. Buy or sell your favorite cryptocurrency in just a few clicks
with peace of mind, knowing that your funds are safe and you are dealing with a trustworthy
organization. With ETHBITS, security and access are the new reality and will become the
standard because we at ETHBITS believe that everyone, everywhere should have access to
crypto currencies.
Having a solid and strong foundation drives our strategy and that is why our first launch will
cover crypto to fiat conversions for citizens all over Europe. Be it Greece, Slovenia, Germany or
Finland, users will be able to convert their cryptocurrency to their local fiat.

What are ETHBITS Goals?
At ETHBITS, we are a young and innovative company and we seek not only usability, but also
hold the intrinsic standards of cryptocurrencies in high regard - the principles of anonymity and
decentralization. We aim to minimize bureaucracy and build an easy-to-use, fool-proof
platform for the masses.
Specifically, our goals are:

• To offer P2P exchanges between major fiat currencies and a variety of cryptocurrencies
with a large and active community.

• To offer a new way to trade, copying expert traders’ movements.
• To offer a physical goods exchange where users can exchange their goods in a fast and
secure manner.
In addition to creating a safe platform to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, we have implemented
several unique selling points which enable us to approach and attract a wider audience.
ETHBITS is a financial company constantly seeking new technology on the market and adapting
our future goals accordingly.

What are ETHBITS Objectives?
Currently our powerful platform enables selling and buying of cryptocurrencies using bank
transfers, and will soon make selling and buying an easy process all over Europe. ETHBITS
ensures the security of users’ funds via cold storage, and has very strict rules when selecting
sellers, providing buyers with the confidence they want.
During the first phase of the rollout, ETHBITS is integrated with the existing platform of
Ethereum, which has been proven to be a reliable and stable base. We plan to evaluate
migrating the codebase to the WAVES platform once the WAVES platform is mature. We
believe that ETHBITS can benefit from the many features WAVES can offer.
Our ultimate objective is to create an exchange for the people owned by the people which
also provides profit to the people; because we believe our profit is our investors profit too.

What are ETHBITS Innovations?
Features new to the crypto-world make our platform unique. At ETHBITS we are targeting
professionals and newcomers alike. Customer security is extremely important to us, and why
we integrated our platform with Trezor. Our unique features include:

 Pool trading – We integrate with up to 15 leading cryptocurrencies, and by using trading
forces major profits can be obtained by trading in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

 Cold and secure storage of user funds - We alleviate the worry of hacking attempts with
the use of cold and secure storage. Use your Trezor device to access and store your
money securely, using two-factor authentication and other security verification
methods.

 Catering to inexperienced users – Our system allows inexperienced traders to copy the
movements of those who are much more experienced. New traders can benefit from
the expertise and knowledge of experienced market gamers. For users with no time to
research trading, there will be the option to Auto Trade. Auto Trade is a feature that
automatically follows the top traders based on their historical as well as present
performance level. Auto Trade is the safest way of trading and will be implemented in
the ETHBITS Investment Fund.

 ETHBITS Investment Fund - We will provide a completely managed investment fund,
based on the leading cryptocurrencies. Users can choose to invest without the hassle of
knowing when to buy or to sell! We will base this in the top five currencies - users just
decide how much to invest and for how long.

 Advantages for traders – Traders who work in our platform have the opportunity of
earning a percentage of their follower’s profit and obtain power-ups to gain certain
privileges, such as reduced fees.

 Credit Card Integration - A major feature of ETHBITS Local is direct integration with the
new Mycelium card, which enables our users to spend their cryptocurrency easily and
safely. The Mycelium card is a blockchain-based card and mobile wallet for payment
management. Additional information on the Mycelium card can be found at:
https://card.mycelium.com/.

Provably Fair Profit Sharing
Ethbits shares 40% of its profits to the ETB token holders. Although Ethbits service
needs to have some centralized elements when it's launched, we strive for
decentralization and minimizing the need of trust.
All EthBits trades are publicly reported. This is a standard practice for the
contemporary cryptocurrency exchanges and also a requirement for all regulated
exchanges. EthBits takes this one step further; trade data will be uploaded to
Swarm[1] peer-to-peer storage ensuring the data availability even if the service
itself goes down some day.
To verify the trade data integrity the users can check that trades they make
appear in the published trade data. Furthermore, the completed trades get a
sequential trade id that ensures there are no gaps in the trade data.
The dividends are paid out quarterly. Based on the published trade data, EthBits
loads the ETH amount of dividend payout into a smart contract. The smart
contract contains a table of token holders taken as a snapshot of the dividends
declaration date. The token holders then proceed to call the smart contract
function pay Dividends() from the wallet where they held the tokens at the time
of a snapshot. The smart contract then will proceed to pay the dividends to the
wallet that made the claim.
If the snapshot of the token holders do not match the dividends payout amounts
100%, the dividends smart contract refuse to pay out any dividends. This way,
either all dividends get paid out fairly to the token holders or none of dividends
are paid out. EthBits researches real time dividend payouts as micro transactions.
However, as the writing of this, Ethereum network does not yet scale to such
small, high volume, transactions. This will become option when Ethereum
network receives sharing[2] and lighting network capabilities[3].

Why is ETHBITS launching a Token Crowdsale for iTrade?
Although we have seven important shareholders, we want to offer an opportunity to everyone
to become involved in the early stages of this exciting project, creating an opportunity of profit
and being part of a revolutionary movement. Exchanges work because people use them to buy
and sell their assets. Big traders (whales) have access to a premium on trading fees, but no
exchange has a model with a cash-back option.
This is what makes ETHBITS so unique - the more you use our exchange platform, the more
profit is made, which means more profit back to the users.
ETHBITS iTrade is the next step in our development and will allow new users with all the
information needed to decide whom to follow, including a full profile outlining profit and loss in
different time frames and historical graphs of performance. Users can choose to be notified
every time they copy a trade and can check the overall profit ratio for a certain period.
Features of iTrade include:









Pool trading of 15 cryptocurrencies and fiat.
Ability to use virtual cryptocurrency to gain experience and understanding of trading.
Full history of each trader (optional for traders).
Ability to automatically follow up to five traders.
Full range of professional analysis tools and trading tools.
Multiple levels of the user interface – simple, intermediate and professional.
Token rewards for high volume traders.
Token rewards for new sign-ups.

ETHBITS iTrade is taking local Bitcoins to the next level making it easy to buy
cryptocurrency world-wide. With a full history of user trading, decisions are easy,
even for novice users. With a few clicks, users can copy the trades of experienced
traders. Users can earn rewards for large volume trading and bringing new users
to the platform. To achieve that objective, we developed a token approach:
ETHBITS Tokens.

What are Tokens? How will the ETHBITS iTrade Token Crowdsale work?
The ETHBIT token is a type of currency used to pay fees on the ETHBITS Local platform (for
example to buy/sell Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies). ETHBIT tokens can also be used
to distribute dividends to investors. If you hold ETHBITS tokens, you hold a portion of our
platform, and by holding a portion of our platform you are entitled to your share of a
distribution of 40% of the platform’s profit. The dividends will be paid on a quarterly basis 1.
A total of 4 mill tokens will be sold and a maximum of 5 mill tokens will ever be in existence.
The final number of Ethbits created will be determined by how many tokens are sold in the
Token Crowdsale:

• 4 Mill tokens will be sold during the Crowdsale and all unsold will be burned 2.
• 10% of tokens sold will be used to drive the platform Ethbits iTrade
• 4% of the tokens will go to the core team and the remaining 11% will be used for
Marketing and PR3.

It’s easy to get started using an Ethereum smart contract and Ether. Receive ETHBIT tokens
from our four tiers rolling out over a four-week period https://ico.ethbits.com:

Week 1 - Tier 1 - 0.010 ETH per ETB
Week 2 - Tier 2 - 0.011 ETH per ETB
Week 3 - Tier 3 - 0.012 ETH per ETB
Week 4 - Tier 4 - 0.013 ETH per ETB

Dividends are to be paid quarterly starting three months after the Token Crowdsale.

Note that unsold Tokens will not be considered in the distribution of the 40% of gross profit. The minimum investment needed
to be raised in the Token Crowdsale is 7500 ETHER. We are expecting that most of the investment will be allocated to
development by the core team, as well as local legislative compliance activities.

Cryptocurrencies will change the world and ETHBITS wants to be there when it happens by
offering an innovative and secure platform to allow the world to safely trade and exchange
assets.
Bitcoins are gaining legitimacy and with increasing numbers of companies like Reddit,
WordPress, Baidu, and small businesses (like pizza chains) accepting Bitcoin payments, it’s the
start of a financial revolution. Binary trading and Forex brokers have begun allowing trades with
Bitcoins. Bitcoin is the pioneer of the new cryptocurrency era, but the diverse cryptocurrency
scene, fails to convince the masses.
As the one and only intermediary, ETHBITS will guide and eventually be the technology that
gives both experienced and novice users a peek into the future of currency.
With this Token Crowdsale we offer you a new business model, which in our vision is bound to
succeed.

SUMMARY

Exscudo is the next-gen financial ecosystem. Its main
goal is to integrate cryptocurrencies into the traditional
financial world and to create a single gateway to the
market for common users, traders, investors and financial
institutions. This is the cryptocurrency liquidity center
featuring a whole range of add-on services meant to
improve users’ experience. All Exscudo services are
connected to the liquidity center via the company’s own
blockchain EON - this measure makes them more secure
and transparent than existing cryptocurrency exchanges.
The EON blockchain platform enables the whole system
to be transparent without disclosing bank secrecy.
We are building a new financial ecosystem, that’s why
we do not want to attract venture capital to finance our
product. We are going for an ICO instead, attracting the
crypto community to be our stockholders. Every EON
coin holder can start his or her own node, deposit the
coins and get the commission from the transactions
processed by the node.
Exscudo strives to make operations with cryptocurrencies
legally compliant both for individuals and financial
institutions, making it easy for them to enter the
cryptocurrency market.

INTRODUCTION.
THE CHALLENGES
OF TRADITIONAL
FINANCIAL
MARKETS

Traditional Financial Market
The traditional market has a complex structure, it is
archaic and overly regulated. Here is an outline of how it
looks like today:

The access to it is rather complicated for an individual.
Besides, it involves a long chain of intermediaries, where
everybody charges commissions, making the access to
the market for those who would like to trade quite pricy.
Such a structure prevents small individual capitals from
entering the market.
Everybody has faced this problem if he or she tried to
transfer money from one country to another or any
other kind of international transaction - sometimes
commissions are as high as 10% or more!
With cryptocurrencies the commissions are minimal
and are equal to some fractions of a percent, and there
is no threshold. The system makes microtransactions
possible, which are quite problematic on the traditional
market. Thus, what is left for the majority of small market
5

MARKETS

participants are high commissions, high spreads and
exchange differences.
Nowadays capital markets tend to be simpler, direct
access to capital for market participants, eradication of
intermediaries and lower commissions.

Once the suitable technologies for the realization of
these needs emerged, the market began to actively
implement them. Thanks to blockchain technology and
cryptocurrencies it becomes possible to renew the market
entirely.

Appeal of Cryptocurrencies for the
Traditional Finance Market
Investment protection in times of crisis is one of the
most important investment skills. Whenever some kind
of natural, political or financial crisis breaks out, gold
remains one of the best investment of your capital.
Traditionally, gold and other precious metals are
considered one of the best ways to hedge risks. However,
cryptocurrency has recently become attractive from

6

INTRODUCTION.
THE CHALLENGES
OF TRADITIONAL
FINANCIAL
MARKETS

investment point of view as an alternative to hedge
against local political, economic and market risks. In
addition, the growth potential of cryptocurrency is huge.
High market volatility is attractive for traders. These assets
have earned the reputation of an attractive object of highrisk and high-yield investments.

Low Penetration
of the Traditional Banking System
Another problem of the traditional financial system is low
penetration of banking systems around the world.
According to recent studies of McKinsey&Company,
about 2.5 billion of adult population all over the world do
not have access to banks and microfinance institutions.
However according to the International
Telecommunication Union, 47% of the world’s population,
or 3.4 billion people have internet access. Thus, for a
great number of people, more than 2 billion around the
world, the best tool to be involved in the global economy
is to make online cryptocurrency transactions.

Challenges of the Cryptocurrency Market
Since 2009 the cryptocurrency market has gone from the
very beginning to the formation of the basic structure.
Despite the fact that the market has evolved, its members
continue to face a number of difficulties at both technical,
legal and product levels.
States endeavor to monitor the financial system and
prevent the economy from growing in the gray zone.
Due to the fact that many cryptocurrency projects
operate in an unregulated area, states refuse to consider
cryptocurrency as a means of payment at the national
level. This is the reason for all the major legal difficulties
of the cryptocurrency market. For this particular reason
institutional investors can not enter the market because
of concerns regarding client due diligence, the laws
on anti-money laundering and other issues that arise
in connection with the cryptocurrency pseudonymous
nature.

7

INTRODUCTION.
THE CHALLENGES
OF TRADITIONAL
FINANCIAL
MARKETS

Technical issues are associated with the complexity of
blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies for everyday
users. There are few convenient integrated products on
the market, which could become a single point of access
to the market for everyone.
It is difficult for an average user to create a
cryptocurrency wallet to keep his assets safe.
Some other technical issues are related to scalability
of existing blockchain technologies, bandwidth, the
size of blockchain and vulnerability to SPAM attacks.
Besides, a number of modern cryptocurrency exchanges
were created by enthusiasts, which were not proficient
in the sphere of IT-security which results in possible
vulnerabilities of the exchanges.
Some technical difficulties are also connected with the
consensus algorithm: PoW (proof-of-work) leads to the
mining centralization; and existing PoS (proof-of-stake)
consensus algorithms allow use of various types of
attacks.
One cannot deny the issue of hyper-volatility of markets
in conditions of limited supply. With high regional
fragmentation of markets, isolation of funds of the
exchange order books (with separate margin trading and
separate exchange operations) and the absence of a large
and single center of liquidity, market makers can easily
manipulate cryptocurrency prices.
In addition, the fragmentation of the market affects the
issue of the optimal price choice. Traders need to gather
information from dozens of websites, web forums and
other sources to make a simple choice concerning the
price.
Another urgent problem of cryptocurrency markets lays
within the lack of high-tech solutions with a high degree
of technical security and legal protection of assets, highperformance architecture platforms and professional
tools for trading. This is another reason why institutional
investors still cannot enter the cryptocurrency market.
Because of all the problems mentioned above the spread
of cryptocurrencies on the traditional financial market
is rather low. These challenges limit the involvement of

8

FINANCIAL
MARKETS

new user segments, which slows down the penetration of
cryptocurrency into new regions.
According to the latest Juniper Research, by 2019, the
number of active Bitcoin users can get closer to 5 million.
However, now the blockchain network has reached its
capacity limit of 350 thousand confirmed transactions per
day - if we compare it with the traditional financial market,
then PayPal at the same stage of development had more
than 100 million active accounts, all this despite the fact
that it worked with a less developed IT infrastructure
and besides required passport data of the user for
authentication.investment point of view as an alternative
to hedge against local political, economic and market
risks. In addition, the growth potential of cryptocurrency
is huge. High market volatility is attractive for traders.
These assets have earned the reputation of an attractive
object of high-risk and high-yield investments.
There is a large number of start-ups, but the market is
still undergoing its infancy. There is a lack of professional
and user-friendly, scalable infrastructure products for the
propagation of cryptocurrency to the mass market and
involvement of users from the classical market.

EXSCUDO
PROJECT MISSION
DESCRIPTION

The main goal of the project is the integration of
cryptocurrencies with the world of equity and financial
markets. We strive to let every person who has access
to the Internet into the cryptocurrency market simply,
quickly, legally and securely. Exscudo solves almost
all of the aforementioned problems found on the
cryptocurrency market:

Trading and Investment
A long chain of intermediaries on fiat exchanges may
ruin your trading experience. 2.5 bn people worldwide
are unbanked and do not have access to any financial
system.
Exscudo provides an opportunity to trade in the open
market with minimal commissions from any device
connected to the Internet. Users can invest, trade,
purchase and manage funds from one single account.

Versatile Trading Tools
Many cryptocurrency exchanges are limited only to
buying and selling currencies and offer the same trading
interfaces for beginners and experts.
The Exscudo exchange features web, mobile clients and
a professional trading terminal. The interfaces are both
user-friendly, adaptable to the needs of experienced
traders and include all the necessary graphs and
indices.

Data Security
The majority of wallets and exchanges are susceptible to
hacks. Data transmission and storage becomes even more
challenging.
Exscudo solves the problem of security. EON,
our proprietary blockchain platform, provides for
independence, decentralized data access and transaction
encryption. Exscudo Channels is a safe way of messaging
and transferring money.

10

EXSCUDO
PROJECT MISSION
DESCRIPTION

Legal Compliance
Institutional investors do not enter the cryptocurrency
market due to legal restrictions. This is also one of the
reasons why retail companies do not accept payments in
cryptocurrencies.
Exscudo grants financial institutions legal access to
cryptocurrencies. Our Merchant Platform lets stores
accept cryptos. To comply with international and national
legislation, Exscudo is getting all necessary licences in the
country of residence in the EU.
Our task is to provide users with professional tools for
legitimate trading, ensuring a reliable technical and legal
protection of their financial assets.
We are creating a center of cryptocurrency liquidity a market in which people without access to banking
ecosystem can just buy and sell digital assets as easily as
institutional investors.
Exscudo’s main task is to provide an ultimate trading and
exchange functionality for different client groups:
Simple operations and one-click services for
those who only need a simple way to buy or sell
cryptocurrencies;
Advanced functionality with automatic trading and
unique strategy development tools for professional
traders;
Simple gates and other features for stores and
cryptocurrency ATM networks.
Another one of Exscudo’s priority is to grant private and
institutional investors access to operations on both crypto
and fiat currency markets that are fully compliant with
the corresponding rules and regulations. This means that
we are integrating our payment system with the banking
system. The underlying technology is EON, a blockchain
network developed specially for financial applications.
EON has the functionality of smart transactions that
handle the interaction of the elements of the Exscudo
Ecosystem.

11

EXSCUDO
PROJECT MISSION
DESCRIPTION

Every user can monitor the anonymized transaction
history in the blockchain through the block explorer. This
grants the transparency of capital flow and eliminates
the necessity of trust to financial reporting of the
exchange, since any transaction can be viewed in the
open blockchain. This innovation makes for transactions
transparent and prevents any possible fraudulent activities
by the payment operators.

The Exscudo ecosystem includes a number of services
- tools for both private investors in crypto-currencies
and for financial institutions. Due to the EON-blockchain
all our solutions work together sharing within the
ecosystem.

DESCRIPTION

The terminal delivers full support of exchange functions,
with a wide range of analytical possibilities, support
of different types of orders, online-listings, interactive
graphs and technical indicators, trading signals and
copies of transactions. The powerful trading system
allows traders to opt for complicated strategies.

EON
To gain independency from third-party developers,
Exscudo uses its own distributed network called EON.
This technology allows Exscudo to handle transactions
between the Exscudo Stock exchange and international
banks, as well as cryptocurrency wallet users and fiat
accounts holders. EON is the fuel that empowers the
whole system. It uses smart transactions algorithm that is
similar, but not equal to the smart contracts mechanism
of the Ethereum network. For security reasons, only the
Dev team will be able to add new smart transactions to
the network at this stage.
EON is not a fully open source project, but the parts that
cover the rules of the consensus, emission and block
confirmation will be published on Github. The part that
deals with the Exscudo Stock Exchange is classified. You
can learn more about EON on its website.
Thanks to our EON blockchain, market participants have
direct access to the capital market. Exscudo’s goal is
to provide everyone, even unbanked people, with the
opportunity to enter the market on an equal basis with
institutional investors and professional traders.
EON gives a number of advantages to the financial
market:
ecosystem simplification;
fast clearing;
low operating costs;
low counterparty risk;
transparency and verifiability;
friendly software development environment.

Exscudo Channels: Secure Chat-wallet
This is one single application that unites the functions
of a multi-currency wallet and an encrypted messenger.
It allows for easy access to the personal account and
financial services of Exscudo. The multicurrency wallet
allows the user to manage cryptocurrency accounts at
any place and time. It helps execute internal transfers
between accounts with instant conversion on the
exchange at market rate and to make payments through
NFC on mobile clients (PayWave).
The payment systems are integrated with the liquidity
center which allows them to use the relevant exchange
rate, a minimum commission for conversion, as well as
to reduce the time for conversion and the time period
required to transfer the funds to the account.
Decentralized messenger for secure communication and
the option to make financial transactions directly on the
chats. You can communicate confidentially and transfer
funds safely, simply by sending a message to your contact.
Despite the usual private conversations, users can create
and join free and paid public and private channels. This
provides a wide range of opportunities not only for
cryptocurrency users, but also for media, bloggers and
public persons.
How EON Blockchain Conducts Transactions of Exscudo
Channels App
A user is sending a message.
His or her contact is receiving the message.
1. The user enters the message and hits ‘send’ button;
2. The message is encoded with the public key of the
contact;
3. The encoded message is sent to a peer;
4. The peer lists the message as ‘unverifiable’ (which is
not included in the blockchain);
5. The message is transmitted to other peers;
a. If the message contains text, ‘5-handshake’ rule
works:

b. If the message contains a payment transaction, it
will be included in the blockchain:
i.

the peer generates a block;

ii. the transaction in the block becomes verified;
iii. this blockchain spreads to other peers.
6. The contact`s peer receives the message;
7. The contact requests all the unreceived messages
from the peer;
8. The message is received by the contact`s device;
9. The message is decoded and displayed in the chat.

Debit Cards
Debit Cards are connected to the user account and
provide the option to pay and exchange currencies in real
time.
This is the most simple connection for the user between
the classical financial market and the cryptocurrency
market. Simply deposit the fiat or cryptocurrency on your
account in the Exscudo wallet and the card is ready to be
used. The currencies are exchanged for the price of the
Exscudo Exchange at the moment of purchase. The card
is accepted all over the world for online purchases and in
brick-and-mortar stores with minimum commissions.

Merchant Tools
It is the fastest, safest and cheapest payment method for
clients in terms of commission. the merchant features
low commission, compared to fiat currencies and a
multitude of supported cryptocurrencies for payment.
It has ability to generate reports for points of sale. This
is a solution for business entities that are willing to
accept cryptocurrencies and may or may not wish to
deal with them directly. The cryptocurrencies accepted
from customers can be automatically converted into
fiat currencies and transferred to the company’s bank
account. The currencies are exchanged for the price
on the Exscudo Exchange at the moment of purchase.
This eliminates the problem of exchange differences
and allows for a minimum spread. This merchant
platform enables the company to operate and accept
cryptocurrencies legally.

EON NETWORK
BRIEF DESCRIPTION

Unfortunately, existing blockchain systems could not give
us enough flexibility, functionality and independence
from third parties, which motivated us to develop our
own blockchain platform - EON.
EON is a decentralized blockchain-based platform that
provides the infrastructure for the Exscudo services. This
platform is not an alternative for Bitcoin, Ethereum and
any other altcoin - it was created to solve specific tasks
within the Exscudo system. Some existing blockchains
either do not have any long-term roadmaps, or have flaws
in their architecture.
EON is not superior to any leading blockchain-based
platforms, but it enables Exscudo to be independent and
launch new functions when it is needed.
The architecture of EON is based on a simple core.
The core calculates a math model and has a number
of services connected to it. These services add more
functionality to the Exscudo system.
EON blockchain is not open source, 95% of the code is
proprietary. However all the parts concerning consensus
rules, coin emission and block confirmation will be
published on GitHub. Open source code allows the
community to audit these parts of the system, create their
own coins based on EON and to integrate their projects
into the Exscudo system.

EON Blockchain Basic Principles
Data Exchange
All the nodes are passive. This means that the system does
not use any broadcasting to spread information among
the nodes. Data exchange is performed according to two
principles:
1. Storage of new user transactions;
2. Requesting nodes to share new data.
There is no node which ‘knows’ everything about the
system. It just connects to random nodes.
If the node which receives request behaves outside the
framework defined by the model, it is placed in the black
30

EON NETWORK
BRIEF DESCRIPTION

list. After some time the blacklisted node will go into ‘read
only’ mode - it will not participate in the generation of
new blocks. If there are several such nodes, then after a
while they will be ‘sorted out’ from the main network.
The algorithm of data distribution over the network
provides for their random spread, i.e. no one can find
out from which particular node the data came into
the network. The node checks all incoming data: if
the transaction does not have a valid signature, or
does not pass the parameter check, it is rejected and
not processed. Each transaction type is checked in
accordance with its logic.
Transactions
The term “transaction” is used to denote a data packet
signed by the sender, which contains a description
of some action - an atomic change in the state of the
system. Any particular action of a user is sent to the
system by means of a particular transaction.
EON transactions, unlike Bitcoin transactions, do not have
locking scripts. Instead, explicitly defined user profile links
are used to identify the sender and the recipient.
Each transaction contains the following data:
its creation time;
its lifespan time in case it is not included in the block;
base transaction link, which is included in the
blockchain earlier;
recipient address;
commission amount in EON coins;
the data itself;
sender address;
sender signature.
Signature
Digital signatures are based on the elliptic curves
algorithm EdDSA, or rather its accelerated and enhanced

31

EON NETWORK
BRIEF DESCRIPTION

version - Ed25519. This algorithm was developed and
implemented by Bernstein (https://cryptojedi.org/papers/
ed25519-20110926.pdf).
For transactions performed on behalf of an aggregator
profile, a multi-signature is used. For example it can be a
“settlement account”, the withdrawal of coins from which
is carried out by voting of several managers.
Accounts
The term ‘account’ is used to refer to a member
of a system that can act as a sender or recipient of
transactions. Transactions sent on behalf of an unknown
account are not accepted for processing.
Each account has an address. This address is formed
on the basis of a public key. The state of the account
at a particular time is determined as the result of the
execution of a sequence of atomic actions described by
transactions.
To register a new account, the system uses a transaction
of the appropriate type which allows you to transfer the
data necessary to verify the transactions sent on behalf
of this member to the network. In addition to saving the
above data, this will eliminate the danger of sending coins
to a non-existent account.
The registration transaction does not contain a
commission, this moment opens technical possibilities
for organizing a DDoS attack. Protection is ensured by the
fact that registration transactions have a minimum priority
and are included in the block last.
Consensus
New blocks are added in equal time intervals.
Each node can offer its own variant of a new block,
if it has synced its chain with at least one more node.
To perform chain synchronization between nodes, a
comparison between their cumulative complexity is made
and the more complex variant is chosen.

32

EON NETWORK
BRIEF DESCRIPTION

The cumulative complexity of block B is calculated by the
following rule:

D=Dprev+bal(A’)*M/hash(hash(Bprev),A)
1. It takes generation signature (hash Bprev) in the
previous block.
2. To verify the ownership of the address, it is signed
using the user key of the generating block (A).
3. The scope of the hash function (M) is divided by
the value obtained from the first 8 bytes of the
signature.
4. To obtain a new cumulative complexity, multiplication
of the value obtained at step 3 and the amount of
deposited funds (balA ‘) is made.
5. Complexity of the previous block (B prev) is added.
In view of the fact that keys corresponding to users
are publicly known, each participant can check the
complexity himself.
It is clear from the equation that there is a restriction
on the signature of blocks in the network. Blocks in the
network can only be signed by delegates who must
confirm their obligations by depositing funds through
issuing the relevant transaction. The size of the deposit
must exceed the minimum value in XXXX coins (the exact
value will be announced at the official launch of the
network).
A delegate can withdraw the deposited funds through a
reverse transaction. The delay in withdrawal of funds from
the deposit (the duration of the guarantee period) exceeds
the maximum depth of branching.
Half of the fee for the released block, which is equal to the
amount of commissions for all block transactions, is sent
to the account that issued the block for its generation.
The other half is distributed according to the algorithm.
You can find more details about the rules of the EON
network in the official whitepaper on the website
http://eontechnology.org

33

EON NETWORK
BRIEF DESCRIPTION

Exscudo Integration
The majority of the code of the Exscudo ecosystem is
proprietary because of our security policy. However we
try to make the ecosystem as transparent as possible
to the community and open to integration with other
services and platforms.
We will publish the source code concerning consensus
rules, coin emission and block confirmation on GitHub.
The description of the mathematical model is available in
the EON whitepaper on the site eontechnology.org.
For more information on building additional services and
applications on EON, integrating new smart transactions
(smart contracts) into the blockchain platform thirdparty devs should contact our team for additional
information.
In the future we will release API for merchant services and
API for exchange trading, which will allow many services
to be integrated into our ecosystem.
Security and Audit
In the second quarter of 2017 we are conducting
an external independent security audit of the EON
blockchain. During 2017 we are conducting an external
security audit of all components of the exchange
ecosystem.
In addition, during 2017 we will conduct an external
independent audit of the public part of the ecosystem and
all innovations that we will use to work with banks and
external services.
We will publish the source code concerning consensus
rules, coin emission and block confirmation on GitHub.
The description of the mathematical model is available in
the EON whitepaper on the site eontechnology.org.
Our philosophy is based on three main principles:
1. Creating a reliable technology platform with deep
protection from external threats.
2. Protection from human factor and human errors.
3. Protection against unauthorized access to insider
information.
34

EON NETWORK
BRIEF DESCRIPTION

An important component of our protection is the EON
blockchain, which allows us to eliminate direct access to
cryptocurrencies and store them in secure cold wallets,
and to store fiat currencies in a bank account.
Due to the blockchain platform and Colored Coins
technology, trading on the exchange is carried out
through the exchange of colored coins, which are
equivalent to and can be redeemed for the corresponding
cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.
In addition, due to the team’s high competence in
building banking and exchange products, we use
advanced architectures and security solutions in our
products.

35

COINS AND ICO

ICO Goals
In Exscudo, we are building a new architecture of the
financial ecosystem and therefore do not want to follow
the standard pattern, the beaten path of centralized
venture financing, creating another tool of the old
economy, as so we are holding an ICO. And we invite the
community to become our shareholders.
One of the main objectives of the ICO is the launch of the
decentralized EON network, and the organization of the
collective ownership of the EON network.
Every EON coin holder can start his or her own node,
deposit the coins and get the commission from the
transactions processed by the node.
In addition, due to the capitalization of the network,
we plan to accelerate the launch of the products of the
Exscudo ecosystem to the market. And also to ensure high
liquidity of the Exscudo ecosystem, in order to provide the
community with low fees for financial transactions in the
ecosystem.

ICO Plan
The ICO will be held in one stage, which will last 37 days,
from April 25 to May 31, 2017.
A few weeks before the ICO, coins pre-order will be
launched. You can book some volume of EONs in your
account before the ICO starts.
Those who book the investment package in advance and
buy them out within the first 48 hours during the ICO will
receive a 10% bonus in the form of additional EONs to the
account.
All pre-orders will be listed in one common ‘book’ and
will be closed upon the appropriate payment within 48
hours from the start of ICO in higher priority than other
orders.
Besides, those who buy non-reserved coins during the
first week of ICO are awarded with 5% bonus coins.
During the second week the bonus is 2.5%. There will be
no bonuses during the third week and later.

36

COINS AND ICO

In addition, all those who participate in the ICO will
receive a bonus for their personal account on the stock
exchange. Everyone who participates in the ICO will get
a zero commission for all operations on the exchange
for a daily trading-exchange volume equal to the amount
invested. This lifetime privilege is assigned to your
account.
All pre-sale coin orders will be listed in a single
orderbook. The coins that have been reserved in advance
can be redeemed within 48 hours of the start of the
crowdsale. At the same time, payments received for the
purchase of the coins in the first 48 hours will be closed
according to the priority order from the orderbook.
Payments received outside the presale campaign will be
closed in the order in which the payments are received.

20%
of all coins will be allocated to the technical fund for the
initial stabilization of the network. They will not enter the
market in the next a few years as they will be deposited on
corporate Exscudo nodes. Later, as soon as the network
has reached the necessary level of decentralization,
the destiny of these coins will be determined by the
company’s board of directors.

In the event that not all of the coins allocated for
investment are sold during the ICO, 50% of the remaining
unsold coins will be distributed among the ICO
participants, in shares equal to possession of the tokens at
the time of the ICO’s end.
The shares of the Exscudo team, the board of directors,
the share of technical coins, the Bounty campaign coins,
and the coins of advisors and testers will not participate in
the distribution of the unsold portion of the coins.
Out of the remaining 50% of unsold coins we will form a
non-profit Exscudo fund, its main task will be scientific
development of the EON blockchain and Exscudo security
systems.
The starting price of the EON coins will be announced
before the ICO.

COINS AND ICO

ICO Key points. Development Plan.
This is a preliminary plan of the Exscudo development
depending on the sum of invested funds during the
ICO:
1 000 - 3 500 BTC
Formation of a decentralized EON network.
Expansion of the ecosystem products to the second
stage.
Expansion of the ecosystem products to the 3rd stage.
Certification of the company as a financial institution
in accordance with international standards.
General marketing and product launch.
3 500 - 10 000 BTC
Increase of the liquidity of the ecosystem in fiat
currency to reduce commission and time delays when
working with fiat currencies through our partner
banks.
Opening of the company’s operational offices in
China, USA, Great Britain.
Local procedures of legal conformity in some
countries which will enable us to work with financial
institutions.
Local marketing in selected countries.
Complete external, independent security audit.
10 000 - 20 000 BTC
Further increase of the liquidity of the ecosystem
in fiat currency to reduce commission and time
delays when working with fiat currencies through
our partner banks. The second phase of the liquidity
increase is required due to the growing number
of users, and hence the increase in the number of
international transactions.
40

COINS AND ICO

Expansion into countries with a large share of
“unbanked people” and unstable national currencies.
Promotion of Exscudo as an alternative to the
standard payment system.
20 000 BTC +
Further increase of the liquidity of the ecosystem in
fiat currency to reduce commission and time delays
when working with fiat currencies through our
partner banks.

Why Invest in EON
In the Escudo ecosystem one basic type of coin is used:
EON.
It assumes there are 2 types of income.
Commission for owners of running EON network
nodes, confirming transactions in the network.
Speculative income. The number of coins is limited,
their emission will be carried out at a time in the
amount of 240,000,000 EON. Additional emissions
are prohibited according to the consensus rule laid
down when the network is launched.
Bonus
The sum a user invests into the project during the ICO
is equal to the sum that can be traded daily with zero
commission on the Exscudo Exchange. This privilege is
granted to the user account for life.

Filecoin: A Decentralized Storage Network
Protocol Labs
August 14, 2017
Abstract
The internet is in the middle of a revolution: centralized proprietary services are being replaced with
decentralized open ones; trusted parties replaced with verifiable computation; brittle location addresses
replaced with resilient content addresses; inefficient monolithic services replaced with peer-to-peer algorithmic markets. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain networks have proven the utility of decentralized transaction ledgers. These public ledgers process sophisticated smart contract applications and
transact crypto-assets worth tens of billions of dollars. These systems are the first instances of internetwide Open Services, where participants form a decentralized network providing useful services for pay,
with no central management or trusted parties. IPFS has proven the utility of content-addressing by
decentralizing the web itself, serving billions of files used across a global peer-to-peer network. It liberates data from silos, survives network partitions, works offline, routes around censorship, and gives
permanence to digital information.
Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that turns cloud storage into an algorithmic market. The
market runs on a blockchain with a native protocol token (also called “Filecoin”), which miners earn
by providing storage to clients. Conversely, clients spend Filecoin hiring miners to store or distribute
data. As with Bitcoin, Filecoin miners compete to mine blocks with sizable rewards, but Filecoin mining
power is proportional to active storage, which directly provides a useful service to clients (unlike Bitcoin
mining, whose usefulness is limited to maintaining blockchain consensus). This creates a powerful incentive for miners to amass as much storage as they can, and rent it out to clients. The protocol weaves
these amassed resources into a self-healing storage network that anybody in the world can rely on. The
network achieves robustness by replicating and dispersing content, while automatically detecting and
repairing replica failures. Clients can select replication parameters to protect against different threat
models. The protocol’s cloud storage network also provides security, as content is encrypted end-to-end
at the client, while storage providers do not have access to decryption keys. Filecoin works as an incentive
layer on top of IPFS [1], which can provide storage infrastructure for any data. It is especially useful
for decentralizing data, building and running distributed applications, and implementing smart contracts.
This work:
(a) Introduces the Filecoin Network, gives an overview of the protocol, and walks through several
components in detail.
(b) Formalizes decentralized storage network (DSN) schemes and their properties, then constructs Filecoin as a DSN.
(c) Introduces a novel class of proof-of-storage schemes called proof-of-replication, which allows proving
that any replica of data is stored in physically independent storage.
(d) Introduces a novel useful-work consensus based on sequential proofs-of-replication and storage as a
measure of power.
(e) Formalizes verifiable markets and constructs two markets, a Storage Market and a Retrieval Market,
which govern how data is written to and read from Filecoin, respectively.
(f) Discusses use cases, connections to other systems, and how to use the protocol.
Note: Filecoin is a work in progress. Active research is under way, and new versions of this paper will
appear at https://filecoin.io. For comments and suggestions, contact us at research@filecoin.io.

Introduction

Filecoin is a protocol token whose blockchain runs on a novel proof, called Proof-of-Spacetime, where blocks
are created by miners that are storing data. Filecoin protocol provides a data storage and retrieval service
via a network of independent storage providers that does not rely on a single coordinator, where: (1) clients
pay to store and retrieve data, (2) Storage Miners earn tokens by offering storage (3) Retrieval Miners earn
tokens by serving data.

1.1

Elementary Components

The Filecoin protocol builds upon four novel components.
1. Decentralized Storage Network (DSN): We provide an abstraction for network of independent
storage providers to offer storage and retrieval services (in Section 2). Later, we present the Filecoin
protocol as an incentivized, auditable and verifiable DSN construction (in Section 4).
2. Novel Proofs-of-Storage: We present two novel Proofs-of-Storage (in Section 3): (1) Proof-ofReplication allows storage providers to prove that data has been replicated to its own uniquely dedicated
physical storage. Enforcing unique physical copies enables a verifier to check that a prover is not
deduplicating multiple copies of the data into the same storage space; (2) Proof-of-Spacetime allows
storage providers to prove they have stored some data throughout a specified amount of time.
3. Verifiable Markets: We model storage requests and retrieval requests as orders in two decentralized
verifiable markets operated by the Filecoin network (in Section 5). Verifiable markets ensure that
payments are performed when a service has been correctly provided. We present the Storage Market
and the Retrieval Market where miners and clients can respectively submit storage and retrieval orders.
4. Useful Proof-of-Work : We show how to construct a useful Proof-of-Work based on Proof-ofSpacetime that can be used in consensus protocols. Miners do not need to spend wasteful computation
to mine blocks, but instead must store data in the network.

1.2

Protocol Overview

• The Filecoin protocol is a Decentralized Storage Network construction built on a blockchain and with
a native token. Clients spend tokens for storing and retrieving data and miners earn tokens by storing
and serving data.
• The Filecoin DSN handle storage and retrieval requests respectively via two verifiable markets: the
Storage Market and the Retrieval Market. Clients and miners set the prices for the services requested
and offered and submit their orders to the markets.
• The markets are operated by the Filecoin network which employs Proof-of-Spacetime and Proof-ofReplication to guarantee that miners have correctly stored the data they committed to store.
• Finally, miners can participate in the creations of new blocks for the underlining blockchain. The
influence of a miner over the next block is proportional to the amount of their storage currently in use
in the network.
A sketch of the Filecoin protocol, using nomenclature defined later within the paper, is shown in Figure 1
accompanied with an illustration in Figure 2.

1.3

Paper organization

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We present our definition of and requirements for a
theoretical DSNscheme in Section 2. In Section 3 we motivate, define, and present our Proof-of-Replication
and Proof-of-Spacetime protocols, used within Filecoin to cryptographically verify that data is continuously
4

stored in accordance with deals made. Section 4 describes the concrete instantiation of the Filecoin DSN,
describing data structures, protocols, and the interactions between participants. Section 5 defines and describes the concept of Verifiable Markets, as well as their implementations, the Storage Market and Retrieval
Market. Section 6 motivates and describes the use of the Proof-of-Spacetime protocol for demonstrating and
evaluating a miner’s contribution to the network, which is necessary to extend the blockchain and assign
the block reward. Section 7 provides a brief description of Smart Contracts within the Filecoin We conclude
with a discussion of future work in Section 8.

Definition of a Decentralized Storage Network

We introduce the notion of a Decentralized Storage Network (DSN) scheme. DSNs aggregate storage offered
by multiple independent storage providers and self-coordinate to provide data storage and data retrieval to
clients. Coordination is decentralized and does not require trusted parties: the secure operation of theses
systems is achieved through protocols that coordinate and verify operations carried out by individual parties.
DSNs can employ different strategies for coordination, including Byzantine Agreement, gossip protocols, or
CRDTs, depending on the requirements of the system. Later, in Section 4, we provide a construction for
the Filecoin DSN.
Definition 2.1. A DSN scheme Π is a tuple of protocols run by storage providers and clients:
(Put, Get, Manage)
• Put(data) → key: Clients execute the Put protocol to store data under a unique identifier key.
• Get(key) → data: Clients execute the Get protocol to retrieve data that is currently stored using key.
• Manage(): The network of participants coordinates via the Manage protocol to: control the available
storage, audit the service offered by providers and repair possible faults. The Manage protocol is run
by storage providers often in conjunction with clients or a network of auditors1 .
A DSN scheme Π must guarantee data integrity and retrievability as well as tolerate management and storage
faults defined in the following sections.

2.1
2.1.1

Fault tolerance
Management faults

We define management faults to be byzantine faults caused by participants in the Manage protocol. A DSN
scheme relies on the fault tolerance of its underlining Manage protocol. Violations on the faults tolerance
assumptions for management faults can compromise liveness and safety of the system.
For example, consider a DSN scheme Π, where the Manage protocol requires Byzantine Agreement (BA)
to audit storage providers. In such protocol, the network receives proofs of storage from storage providers
and runs BA to agree on the validity of these proofs. If the BA tolerates up to f faults out of n total
nodes, then our DSN can tolerate f < n/2 faulty nodes. On violations of these assumptions, audits can be
compromised.
2.1.2

Storage faults

We define storage faults to be byzantine faults that prevent clients from retrieving the data: i.e. Storage
Miners lose their pieces, Retrieval Miners stop serving pieces. A successful Put execution is (f, m)-tolerant
if it results in its input data being stored in m independent storage providers (out of n total) and it can
tolerate up to f byzantine providers. The parameters f and m depend on protocol implementation; protocol
designers can fix f and m or leave the choice to the user, extending Put(data) into Put(data, f , m). A Get
execution on stored data is successful if there are fewer than f faulty storage providers.
For example, consider a simple scheme, where the Put protocol is designed such that each storage provider
stores all of the data. In this scheme m = n and f = m − 1. Is it always f = m − 1? No, some schemes can
be designed using erasure coding, where each storage providers store a special portion of the data, such that
x out of m storage providers are required to retrieve the data; in this case f = m − x.

2.2

Properties

We describe the two required properties for a DSN scheme and then present additional properties required
by the Filecoin DSN.
1 In

the case where the Manage protocol relies on a blockchain, we consider the miners as auditors, since they verify and
coordinate storage providers

8

2.2.1

Data Integrity

This property requires that no bounded adversary A can convince clients to accept altered or falsified data
at the end of a Get execution.
Definition 2.2. A DSN scheme Π provides data integrity if: for any successful Put execution for some data
d under key k, there is no computationally-bounded adversary A that can convince a client to accept d0 , for
d0 6= d at the end of a Get execution for identifier k.
2.2.2

Retrievability

This property captures the requirement that, given our fault-tolerance assumptions of Π, if some data has
been successfully stored in Π and storage providers continue to follow the protocol, then clients can eventually
retrieve the data.
Definition 2.3. A DSN scheme Π provides retrievability if: for any successful Put execution for data under
key, there exists a successful Get execution for key for which a client retrieves data.2 .
2.2.3

Other Properties

DSNs can provide other properties specific to their application. We define three key properties required by
the Filecoin DSN: public verifiability, auditability, and incentive-compatibility.
Definition 2.4. A DSN scheme Π is publicly verifiable if: for each successful Put, the network of storage
providers can generate a proof that the data is currently being stored. The Proof-of-Storage must convince
any efficient verifier, which only knows key and does not have access to data.
Definition 2.5. A DSN scheme Π is auditable, if it generates a verifiable trace of operation that can be
checked in the future to confirm storage was indeed stored for the right duration of time.
Definition 2.6. A DSN scheme Π is incentive-compatible, if: storage providers are rewarded for successfully
offering storage and retrieval service, or penalized for misbehaving, such that the storage providers’ dominant
strategy is to store data.

2 This

definition does not guarantee every Get to succeed: if every Get eventually returns data, then the scheme is fair.

3

Proof-of-Replication and Proof-of-Spacetime

In the Filecoin protocol, storage providers must convince their clients that they stored the data they were
paid to store; in practice, storage providers will generate Proofs-of-Storage (PoS) that the blockchain network
(or the clients themselves) verifies.
In this section we motivate, present and outline implementations for the Proof-of-Replication (PoRep) and
Proof-of-Spacetime (PoSt) schemes used in Filecoin.

3.1

Motivation

Proofs-of-Storage (PoS) schemes such as Provable Data Possession (PDP) [2] and Proof-of-Retrievability
(PoR) [3, 4] schemes allow a user (i.e. the verifier V) who outsources data D to a server (i.e. the prover P) to
repeatedly check if the server is still storing D. The user can verify the integrity of the data outsourced to a
server in a very efficient way, more efficiently than downloading the data. The server generates probabilistic
proofs of possession by sampling a random set of blocks and transmits a small constant amount of data in
a challenge/response protocol with the user.
PDP and PoR schemes only guarantee that a prover had possession of some data at the time of the challenge/response. In Filecoin, we need stronger guarantees to prevent three types of attacks that malicious
miners could exploit to get rewarded for storage they are not providing: Sybil attack, outsourcing attacks,
generation attacks.
• Sybil Attacks: Malicious miners could pretend to store (and get paid for) more copies than the ones
physically stored by creating multiple Sybil identities, but storing the data only once.
• Outsourcing Attacks: Malicious miners could commit to store more data than the amount they can
physically store, relying on quickly fetching data from other storage providers.
• Generation Attacks: Malicious miners could claim to be storing a large amount of data which they
are instead efficiently generating on-demand using a small program. If the program is smaller than
the purportedly stored data, this inflates the malicious miner’s likelihood of winning a block reward in
Filecoin, which is proportional to the miner’s storage currently in use.

3.2

Proof-of-Replication

Proof-of-Replication (PoRep) is a novel Proof-of-Storage which allows a server (i.e. the prover P) to convince
a user (i.e. the verifier V) that some data D has been replicated to its own uniquely dedicated physical
storage. Our scheme is an interactive protocol, where the prover P: (a) commits to store n distinct replicas
(physically independent copies) of some data D, and then (b) convinces the verifier V, that P is indeed
storing each of the replicas via a challenge/response protocol. To the best of our knowledge, PoRep improves
on PoR and PDP schemes, preventing Sybil Attacks, Outsourcing Attacks, and Generation Attacks.
Note. For a formal definition, a description of its properties, and an in-depth study of Proof-of-Replication,
we refer the reader to [5].
Definition 3.1. (Proof-of-Replication) A PoRep scheme enables an efficient prover P to convince a verifier
V that P is storing a replica R, a physical independent copy of some data D, unique to P. A PoRep protocol
is characterized by a tuple of polynomial-time algorithms:
(Setup, Prove, Verify)
• PoRep.Setup(1λ , D) → R, SP , SV , where SP and SV are scheme-specific setup variables for P and V, λ
is a security parameter. PoRep.Setup is used to generate a replica R, and give P and V the necessary
information to run PoRep.Prove and PoRep.Verify. Some schemes may require the prover or interaction
with a third party to compute PoRep.Setup.
10

• PoRep.Prove(SP , R, c) → π c , where c is a random challenge issued by a verifier V, and π c is a proof
that a prover has access to R a specific replica of D. PoRep.Prove is run by P to produce a π c for V.
• PoRep.Verify(SV , c, π c ) → {0, 1}, which checks whether a proof is correct. PoRep.Verify is run by V and
convinces V whether P has been storing R.

3.3

Proof-of-Spacetime

Proof-of-Storage schemes allow a user to check if a storage provider is storing the outsourced data at the time
of the challenge. How can we use PoS schemes to prove that some data was being stored throughout a period
of time? A natural answer to this question is to require the user to repeatedly (e.g. every minute) send
challenges to the storage provider. However, the communication complexity required in each interaction can
be the bottleneck in systems such as Filecoin, where storage providers are required to submit their proofs to
the blockchain network.
To address this question, we introduce a new proof, Proof-of-Spacetime, where a verifier can check if a prover
is storing her/his outsourced data for a range of time. The intuition is to require the prover to (1) generate
sequential Proofs-of-Storage (in our case Proof-of-Replication), as a way to determine time (2) recursively
compose the executions to generate a short proof.
Definition 3.2. (Proof-of-Spacetime) A PoSt scheme enables an efficient prover P to convince a verifier
V that P is storing some data D for some time t. A PoSt is characterized by a tuple of polynomial-time
algorithms:
(Setup, Prove, Verify)
• PoSt.Setup(1λ , D) → SP , SV , where SP and SV are scheme-specific setup variables for P and V, λ is a
security parameter. PoSt.Setup is used to give P and V the necessary information to run PoSt.Prove
and PoSt.Verify. Some schemes may require the prover or interaction with a third party to compute
PoSt.Setup.
• PoSt.Prove(SP , D, c, t) → π c , where c is a random challenge issued by a verifier V, and π c is a proof
that a prover has access to D for some time t. PoSt.Prove is run by P to produce a π c for V.
• PoSt.Verify(SV , c, t, π c ) → {0, 1}, which checks whether a proof is correct. PoSt.Verify is run by V and
convinces V whether P has been storing D for some time t.

3.4

Practical PoRep and PoSt

We are interested in practical PoRep and PoSt constructions that can be deployed in existing systems and do
not rely on trusted parties or hardware. We give a construction for PoRep (see Seal-based Proof-of-Replication
in [5]) that requires a very slow sequential computation Seal to be performed during Setup to generate a
replica. The protocol sketches for PoRep and PoSt are presented in Figure 4 and the underlying mechanism
of the proving step in PoSt is illustrated in Figure 3.
3.4.1

Cryptographic building blocks

Collision-resistant hashing. We use a collision resistant hash function CRH : {0, 1}∗ → {0, 1}O(λ) . We
also use a collision resistant hash function MerkleCRH, which divides a string in multiple parts, construct a
binary tree and recursively apply CRH and outputs the root.
zk-SNARKs. Our practical implementations of PoRep and PoSt rely on zero-knowledge Succinct Noninteractive ARguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) [6, 7, 8]. Because zk-SNARKs are succinct, proofs are
very short and easy to verify. More formally, let L be an NP language and C be a decision circuit for L.
A trusted party conducts a one-time setup phase that results in two public keys: a proving key pk and a
verification key vk. The proving key pk enables any (untrusted) prover to generate a proof π attesting that
11

x ∈ L for an instance x of her choice. The non-interactive proof π is both zero-knowledge and proof-ofknowledge. Anyone can use the verification key vk to verify the proof π; in particular zk-SNARK proofs are
publicly verifiable: anyone can verify π, without interacting with the prover that generated π. The proof π
has constant size and can be verified in time that is linear in |x|.
A zk-SNARK for circuit satisfiability is a triple of polynomial-time algorithms
(KeyGen, Prove, Verify)
• KeyGen(1λ , C) → (pk, vk). On input security parameter λ and a circuit C, KeyGen probabilistically
samples pk and vk. Both keys are published as public parameters and can be used to prove/verify
membership in LC .
• Prove(pk, x, w) → π. On input pk and input x and witness for the NP-statement w, the prover Prove
outputs a non-interactive proof π for the statement x ∈ LC .
• Verify(vk, x, π) → {0, 1}. On input vk, an input x, and a proof π, the verifier Verify outputs 1 if
x ∈ LC .
We refer the interested reader to [6, 7, 8] for formal presentation and implementation of zk-SNARK systems.
Generally these systems require the KeyGen operation to be run by a trusted party; novel work on Scalable
Computational Integrity and Privacy (SCIP) systems [9] shows a promising direction to avoid this initial
step, hence the above trust assumption.
3.4.2

Seal operation

The role of the Seal operation is to (1) force replicas to be physically independent copies by requiring provers
to store a pseudo-random permutation of D unique to their public key, such that committing to store n
replicas results in dedicating disk space for n independent replicas (hence n times the storage size of a
replica) and (2) to force the generation of the replica during PoRep.Setup to take substantially longer than
the time expected for responding to a challenge. For a more formal definition of the Seal operation see [5].
The above operation can be realized with SealτAES−256 , and τ such that SealτAES−256 takes 10-100x longer than
the honest challenge-prove-verify sequence. Note that it is important to choose τ such that running SealτBC
is distinguishably more expensive than running Prove with random access to R.
3.4.3

Practical PoRep construction

This section describes the construction of the PoRep protocol and includes a simplified protocol sketch in
Figure 4; implementation and optimization details are omitted.
Creating a Replica. The Setup algorithm generates a replica via the Seal operation and a proof that it was
correctly generated. The prover generates the replica and sends the outputs (excluding R) to the verifier.

Proving Storage. The Prove algorithm generates a proof of storage for the replica. The prover receives a
random challenge, c, from the verifier, which determines a specific leaf R c in the Merkle tree of R with root
rt; the prover generates a proof of knowledge about R c and its Merkle path leading up to rt.

Verifying the Proofs. The Verify algorithm checks the validity of the proofs of storage given the Merkle
root of the replica and the hash of the original data. Proofs are publicly verifiable: nodes in the distributed
system maintaining the ledger and clients interested in particular data can verify these proofs.

Practical PoSt construction

This section describes the construction of the PoSt protocol and includes a simplified protocol sketch in Figure 4; implementation and optimization details are omitted. The Setup and Verify algorithm are equivalent
to the PoRep construction, hence we describe here only Prove.
Proving space and time. The Prove algorithm generates a Proof-of-Spacetime for the replica. The prover
receives a random challenge from the verifier and generate Proofs-of-Replication in sequence, using the output
of a proof as an input of the other for a specified amount of iterations t (see Figure 3).

Usage in Filecoin

The Filecoin protocol employs Proof-of-Spacetime to audit the storage offered by miners. To use PoSt in
Filecoin, we modify our scheme to be non-interactive since there is no designated verifier, and we want any
member of the network to be able to verify. Since our verifier runs in the public-coin model, we can extract
randomness from the blockchain to issue challenges.

Filecoin: a DSN Construction

The Filecoin DSN is a decentralized storage network that is auditable, publicly verifiable and designed on
incentives. Clients pay a network of miners for data storage and retrieval; miners offer disk space and
bandwidth in exchange of payments. Miners receive their payments only if the network can audit that their
service was correctly provided.
In this section, we present the Filecoin DSN construction, based on the DSN definition and Proof-ofSpacetime.

4.1

Setting

4.1.1

Participants

Any user can participate as a Client, a Storage Miner, and/or a Retrieval Miner.
• Clients pay to store data and to retrieve data in the DSN, via Put and Get requests.
• Storage Miners provide data storage to the network. Storage Miners participate in Filecoin by offering
their disk space and serving Put requests. To become Storage Miners, users must pledge their storage
by depositing collateral proportional to it. Storage Miners respond to Put requests by committing to
store the client’s data for a specified time. Storage Miners generate Proofs-of-Spacetime and submit
them to the blockchain to prove to the Network that they are storing the data through time. In case
of invalid or missing proofs, Storage Miners are penalized and loose part of their collateral. Storage
Miners are also eligible to mine new blocks, and in doing so they hence receive the mining reward for
creating a block and transaction fees for the transactions included in the block.
• Retrieval Miners provide data retrieval to the Network. Retrieval Miners participate in Filecoin by
serving data that users request via Get. Unlike Storage Miners, they are not required to pledge,
commit to store data, or provide proofs of storage. It is natural for Storage Miners to also participate
as Retrieval Miners. Retrieval Miners can obtain pieces directly from clients, or from the Retrieval
Market.
4.1.2

The Network, N

We personify all the users that run Filecoin full nodes as one single abstract entity: The Network. The
Network acts as an intermediary that runs the Manage protocol; informally, at every new block in the
Filecoin blockchain, full nodes manage the available storage, validate pledges, audit the storage proofs, and
repair possible faults.
4.1.3

The Ledger

Our protocol is applied on top of a ledger-based currency; for generality we refer to this as the Ledger, L. At
any given time t (referred to as epoch), all users have access to Lt , the ledger at epoch t, which is a sequence
of transactions. The ledger is append-only3 . The Filecoin DSN protocol can be implemented on any ledger
that allows for the verification of Filecoin’s proofs; we show how we can construct a ledger based on useful
work in Section 6.
4.1.4

The Markets

Demand and supply of storage meet at the two Filecoin Markets: Storage Market and Retrieval Market.
The markets are two decentralized exchanges and are explained in detail in Section 5. In brief, clients and
miners set the prices for the services they request or provide by submitting orders to the respective markets.
The exchanges provide a way for clients and miners to see matching offers and initiate deals. By running
the Manage protocol, the Network guarantees that miners are rewarded and clients are charged if the service
requested has been successfully provided.
3t

< t0 implies that Lt is a prefix of L0t

4.2

Data Structures

Pieces. A piece is some part of data that a client is storing in the DSN. For example, data can be deliberately divided into many pieces and each piece can be stored by a different set of Storage Miners.
Sectors. A sector is some disk space that a Storage Miner provides to the network. Miners store pieces
from clients in their sectors and earn tokens for their services. In order to store pieces, Storage Miners must
pledge their sectors to the network.
AllocationTable. The AllocTable is a data structure that keeps track of pieces and their assigned sectors.
The AllocTable is updated at every block in the ledger and its Merkle root is stored in the latest block. In
practice, the table is used to keep the state of the DSN, allowing for quick look-ups during proof verification.
For more details, see Figure 5.
Orders. An order is a statement of intent to request or offer a service. Clients submit bid orders to the
markets to request a service (resp. Storage Market for storing data and Retrieval Market for retrieving data)
and Miners submit ask orders to offer a service. The order data structures are shown in Figure 10. The
Market Protocols are detailed in Section 5.
Orderbook. Orderbooks are sets of orders. See the Storage Market orderbook in Section 5.2.2 and Retrieval
Market orderbook in Section 5.3.2 for details.
Pledge. A pledge is a commitment to offer storage (specifically a sector ) to the network. Storage Miners
must submit their pledge to the ledger in order to start accepting orders in the Storage Market. A pledge
consists of the size of the pledged sector and the collateral deposited by the Storage Miner (see Figure 5 for
more details).

Protocol

In this Section, we give an overview of the Filecoin DSN by describing the operations performed by the
clients, the Network and the miners. We present the methods of the Get and the Put protocol in Figure 7
and the Manage protocol in Figure 8. An example protocol execution is shown in Figure 6. The overall
Filecoin Protocol is presented in Figure 1.
4.3.1

Client Cycle

We give a brief overview of the client cycle; an in-depth explanation of the following protocols is given in
Section 5.
17

1. Put: Client stores data in Filecoin.
Clients can store their data by paying Storage Miners in Filecoin tokens. The Put protocol is described
in detail in Section 5.2.
A client initiates the Put protocol by submitting a bid order to the Storage Market orderbook (by
submitting their order to the blockchain). When a matching ask order from miners is found, the client
sends the piece to the miner. Both parties sign a deal order and submit it to the Storage Market
orderbook.
Clients should be able to decide the amount of physical replicas of their pieces either by submitting
multiple orders (or specifying a replication factor in the order). Higher redundancy results in a higher
tolerance of storage faults.
2. Get: Client retrieves data from Filecoin.
Clients can retrieve any data stored in the DSN by paying Retrieval Miners in Filecoin tokens. The
Get protocol is described in detail in Section 5.3.
A client initiates the Get protocol by submitting a bid order to the Retrieval Market orderbook (by
gossiping their order to the network). When a matching ask order from miners is found, the client
receives the piece from the miner. When received, both parties sign a deal order and submit it to the
blockchain to confirm that the exchange succeeded.
4.3.2

Mining Cycle (for Storage Miners)

We give an informal overview of the mining cycle.
1. Pledge: Storage Miners pledge to provide storage to the Network.
Storage Miners pledge their storage to the network by depositing collateral via a pledge transaction in
the blockchain, via Manage.PledgeSector. The collateral is deposited for the time intended to provide
the service, and it is returned if the miner generates proofs of storage for the data they commit to
store. If some proofs of storage fail, a proportional amount of collateral is lost.
Once the pledge transaction appears in the blockchain, miners can offer their storage in the Storage
Market: they set their price and add an ask order to the market’s orderbook.

2. Receive Orders: Storage Miners get storage requests from the Storage Market.
Once the pledge transaction appears in the blockchain (hence in the AllocTable), miners can offer their
storage in the Storage Market: they set their price and add an ask order to the market’s orderbook
via Put.AddOrders.

Put.AddOrders
 • inputs: list of orders O1 ..On

Once orders are matched, clients send their data to the Storage Miners. When receiving the piece,
miners run Put.ReceivePiece. When the data is received, both the miner and the client sign a deal
order and submit it to the blockchain.

• outputs: deal order Odeal signed by Ci and Mj
3. Seal: Storage Miners prepare the pieces for future proofs.
Storage Miners’ storage is divided in sectors, each sector contains pieces assigned to the miner. The
Network keeps track of each Storage Miners’ sector via the allocation table. When a Storage Miner
sector is filled, the sector is sealed. Sealing is a slow, sequential operation that transforms the data
in a sector into a replica, a unique physical copy of the data that is associated to the public key of
the Storage Miner. Sealing is a necessary operation during the Proof-of-Replication as described in
Section 3.4.

4. Prove: Storage Miners prove they are storing the committed pieces.
When Storage Miners are assigned data, they must repeatedly generate proofs of replication to guarantee they are storing the data (for more details, see Section 3). Proofs are posted on the blockchain
and the Network verifies them.

Mining Cycle (for Retrieval Miners)

We give an informal overview of the mining cycle for Retrieval Miners.
1. Receive Orders: Retrieval Miners get data requests from the Retrieval Market.
Retrieval Miners announce their pieces by gossiping their ask orders to the network: they set their
price and add an ask order to the market’s orderbook.


2. Send: Retrieval Miners send pieces to the client.
Once orders are matched, Retrieval Miners send the piece to the client (see Section 5.3 for details).
When the piece is received, both the miner and the client sign a deal order and submit it to the
blockchain.

Put.SendPieces
 • inputs:


 – an ask order Oask

 – a bid order Obid

 – a piece p
• outputs: a deal order Odeal signed by Mi
4.3.4

Network Cycle

We give an informal overview of the operations run by the network.
1. Assign: The Network assigns clients’ pieces to Storage Miners’ sectors.
Clients initiate the Put protocol by submitting a bid order in the Storage Market4 .
When ask and bid orders match, the involved parties jointly commit to the exchange and submit a
deal order in the market. At this point, the Network assigns the data to the miner and makes a note
of it in the allocation table.

Manage.AssignOrders
 • inputs:


1
n
..Odeal
 – deal orders Odeal

 – allocation table allocTable
• outputs: updated allocation table allocTable0
2. Repair: The Network finds faults and attempt to repair them.
All the storage allocations are public to every participant in the network. At every block, the Network
checks if the required proofs for each assignment are present, checks that they are valid, and acts
accordingly:
• if any proof is missing or invalid, the network penalizes the Storage Miners by taking part of their
collateral,
• if a large amount of proofs are missing or invalid (defined by a system parameter ∆fault ), the
network considers the Storage Miner faulty, settles the order as failed and reintroduces a new
order for the same piece into the the market,
• if every Storage Miner storing this piece is faulty, then the piece is lost and the client gets refunded.

orders are submitted via the blockchain, see Section 5.

The following are the intuitions on how the Filecoin DSN achieves integrity, retrievability, public verifiability
and incentive-compatibility.
• Achieving Integrity: Pieces are named after their cryptographic hash. After a Put request, clients only
need to store this hash to retrieve the data via Get and to verify the integrity of the content received.
• Achieving Retrievability: In a Put request, clients specify the replication factor and the type of erasure
coding desired, specifying in this way the storage to be (f, m)-tolerant. The assumption is that given
m Storage Miners storing the data, a maximum of f faults are tolerated. By storing data in more than
one Storage Miner, a client can increase the chances of recovery, in case Storage Miners go offline or
disappear.
• Achieving Public Verifiability and Auditability: Storage Miners are required to submit their proofs of
storage (πSEAL , πPOST ) to the blockchain. Any user in the network can verify the validity of these
proofs, without having access to the outsourced data. Since the proofs are stored on the blockchain,
they are a trace of operation that can be audited at any time.
• Achieving Incentive Compatibility: Informally, miners are rewarded for the storage they are providing.
When miners commit to store some data, then they are required to generate proofs. Miners that skip
proofs are penalized (by losing part of their collateral) and not rewarded for their storage.
• Achieving Confidentiality: Clients that desire for their data to be stored privately, must encrypt their
data before submitting them to the network.

Filecoin Storage and Retrieval Markets

Filecoin has two markets: the Storage Market and the Retrieval Market. The two markets have the same
structure but different design. The Storage Market allows Clients to pay Storage Miners to store data. The
Retrieval Market allows Clients to retrieve data by paying Retrieval Miners to deliver the data. In both
cases, clients and miners can set their offer and demand prices or accept current offers. The exchanges are
run by the Network - a personification of the network of full nodes in Filecoin. The network guarantees that
miners are rewarded by the clients when providing the service.

5.1

Verifiable Markets

Exchange Markets are protocols that facilitate exchange of a specific good or service. They do this by enabling buyers and sellers to conduct transactions. For our purposes, we require exchanges to be verifiable:
a decentralized network of participants must be able to verify the exchange between buyers and sellers.
We present the notion of Verifiable Markets, where no single entity governs an exchange, transactions are
transparent, and anybody can participate pseudonymously. Verifiable Market protocols operate the exchange
of goods/services in a decentralized fashion: consistency of the orderbooks, orders settlements and correct
execution of services are independently verified via the participants - miners and full nodes in the case of
Filecoin. We simplify verifiable markets to have the following construction:
Definition 5.1. A verifiable Market is a protocol with two phases: order matching and settlement. Orders
are statements of intent to buy or sell a security, good or service and the orderbook is the list of all the
available orders.
Verifiable Market Protocol
Order matching:
1. Participants add buy orders and sell orders to the orderbook.
2. When two orders match, involved parties jointly create a deal order that commits the two parties to
the exchange, and propagate it to the network by adding it to the orderbook.
Settlement:
3. The network ensures that the transfer of goods or services has been executed correctly, by requiring
sellers to generate cryptographic proofs for their exchange/service.
4. On success, the network processes the payments and clears the orders from the orderbook.

Figure 9: Generic protocol for Verifiable Markets

5.2

Storage Market

The Storage Market is a verifiable market which allows clients (i.e. buyers) to request storage for their data
and Storage Miners (i.e. sellers) to offer their storage.
5.2.1

Requirements

We design the Storage Market protocol accordingly to the following requirements:
• In-chain orderbook: It is important that: (1) Storage Miners orders are public, so that the lowest
price is always known to the network and clients can make informed decision on their orders, (2) client
orders must be always submitted to the orderbook, even when they accept the lowest price, in this way
the market can react to the new offer. Hence, we require orders to be added in clear to the Filecoin
blockchain in order to be added to the orderbook.
24

• Participants committing their resources: We require both parties to commit to their resources
as a way to avoid disservice: to avoid Storage Miners not providing the service and to avoid clients not
having available funds. In order to participate to the Storage Market, Storage Miners must pledge,
depositing a collateral proportional to their amount of storage in DSN (see Section 4.3.3 for more
details). In this way, the Network can penalize Storage Miners that do not provide proofs of storage
for the pieces they committed to store. Similarly, clients must deposit the funds specified in the order,
guaranteeing in this way commitment and availability of funds during settlement.
• Self-organization to handle faults: Orders are only settled if Storage Miners have repeatedly
proved that they have stored the pieces for the duration of the agreed-upon time period. The Network
must be able to verify the existence and the correctness of these proofs and act according to the rules
outlined in the Repair portion of Subsection 4.3.4.
5.2.2

Datastructures

Put Orders. There are three types of orders: bid orders, ask orders and deal orders. Storage Miners create
ask orders to add storage, clients create bid orders to request storage, when both parties agree on a price,
they jointly create a deal order. The data structures of the orders are shown in detail in Figure 10, and the
parameters of the orders are explicitly defined.
Put Orderbook. The Orderbook in the Storage Market is the set of currently valid and open ask, bid and
deal orders. Users can interact with the orderbook via the methods defined in the Put protocol: AddOrders,
MatchOrders as described in Figure 7.
The orderbook is public and every honest user has the same view of the orderbook. At every epoch, new
orders are added to the orderbook if new order transactions (txorder ) appear in new blockchain blocks; orders
are removed if they are cancelled, expired or settled. Orders are added in blockchain blocks, hence in the
orderbook, if they are valid:
Definition 5.2. We define the validity of bid, ask, deal orders:
(Valid bid order): A bid order from client Ci , Obid := hsize, funds[, price, time, coll, coding]iCi is valid if:
• Ci has at least the amount of funds available in their account.
• time is not set in the past
• The order must guarantee at least a minimum amount5 of epochs of storage.
(Valid ask order): An ask order from Storage Miner Mi , Oask := hspace, priceiMi is valid if:
• Mi has pledged to be a miner and the pledge will not expire before time epochs.
• space must be less than Mi ’s available storage: Mi pledged storage minus the storage committed
in the orderbook (in ask and deal orders).
(Valid deal order): A deal order Odeal := hask, bid, tsiCi ,Mj is valid if
• ask references an order Oask such that: it is in the Storage Market OrderBook, no other deal orders
in the Storage Market OrderBook mention it, it is signed by Ci .
• bid references an order Obid such that: it is in the Storage Market OrderBook, no other deal orders
in the Storage Market OrderBook mention it, it is signed by Mj .
• ts is not set in the future or too far in the past.
Remark. If a malicious client receives a signed deal from a Storage Miner, but never adds it to the orderbook,
then the Storage Miner cannot re-use the storage committed in the deal. The field ts prevents this attack
because, after ts, the order becomes invalid and cannot be submitted in the orderbook.

5 This

will be a parameter of the system.

5.2.3

The Storage Market Protocol

In brief, the Storage Market protocol is divided in two phases: order matching and settlement:
• Order Matching: Clients and Storage Miners submit their orders to the orderbook by submitting a
transaction to the blockchain (step 1). When orders are matched, the client sends the piece to the
Storage Miner and both parties sign a deal order and submit it to the orderbook (step 2).
• Settlement: Storage Miners seal their sectors (step 3a), generate proofs of storage for the sector containing the piece and submit them to the blockchain regularly (step 3b); meanwhile, the rest of the
network must verify the proofs generated by the miners and repair possible faults (step 3c).
The Storage Market protocol is explained in detail in Figure 11.

5.3

Retrieval Market

The Retrieval Market allows clients to request retrieval of a specific piece and Retrieval Miners to serve it.
Unlike Storage Miners, Retrieval Miners are not required to store pieces through time or generate proofs of
storage. Any user in the network can become a Retrieval Miner by serving pieces in exchange for Filecoin
tokens. Retrieval Miners can obtain pieces by receiving them directly from clients, by acquiring them from
the Retrieval Market, or by storing them from being a Storage Miner.
5.3.1

Requirements

We design the Retrieval Market protocol accordingly to the following requirements:
• Off-chain orderbook: Clients must be able to find Retrieval Miners that are serving the required
pieces and directly exchange the pieces, after settling on the pricing. This means that the orderbook
cannot be run via the blockchain - since this would be the bottleneck for fast retrieval requests - instead
participant will have only partial view of the OrderBook. Hence, we require both parties to gossip their
orders.
• Retrieval without trusted parties: The impossibility results on fair exchange [10] remind us that
it is impossible for two parties to perform an exchange without trusted parties. In the Storage Market,
the blockchain network acts as a (decentralized) trusted party that verifies the storage provided by
the Storage Miners. In the Retrieval Market, Retrieval Miners and clients exchange data without the
network witnessing the exchange of file. We go around this result by requiring the Retrieval Miner to
split their data in multiple parts and for each part sent to the client, they receive a payment. In this
way, if the client stops paying, or the miner stops sending data, either party can halt the exchange.
Note that for this to work, we must assume that there is always one honest Retrieval Miner.
• Payments channels: Clients are interested in retrieving the pieces as soon as they submit their
payments, Retrieval Miners are interested in only serving the pieces if they are sure of receiving a
payment. Validating payments via a public ledger can be the bottleneck of a retrieval request, hence
we must rely on efficient off-chain payments. The Filecoin blockchain must support payment channels
which enable rapid, optimistic transactions and use the blockchain only in case of disputes. In this way,
Retrieval Miners and Clients can quickly send the small payments required by our protocol. Future
work includes the creation of a network of payment channels as previously seen in [11, 12].
5.3.2

Data Structures

Get Orders. There are three types of orders in the Retrieval Market: clients create bid orders Obid , Retrieval
Miners create ask orders Oask , and deal orders Odeal , are created jointly when a Storage Miner and a client
agree on a deal. The datastructures of the orders is shown in detail on Figure 10.
Get Orderbook. The Orderbook in the Retrieval Market is the set of valid and open ask, bid and deal
orders. Unlike the Storage Market, every user has a different view of the orderbook, since the orders are
gossiped in the network and each miner and client only keep track of the orders they are interested in.
27

Storage Market Protocol
Order Matching
1. Storage Miner Mi and Client Ci add orders to the OrderBook:
(a) Mi creates Oask 1 , Oask 2 , .. and Cj creates Obid 1 , Obid 2 , ...
(b) Orders are submitted to the blockchain via Put.addOrders(O 1 , O 2 , ..)
(c) On success, the orders are added to the OrderBook, the funds from Cj are deposited and
the space from Mi is reserved.
2. When orders match, involved parties jointly create Odeal and add it to the OrderBook:
(a) Mi and Cj independently query the OrderBook via Put.matchOrders(O).
(b) If Mi and Cj have matching orders :
• Cj sends the piece p to Mi via Put.SendPieces(Obid , Oask , p)
• Mi receives the piece p from Cj via Put.ReceivePieces(Obid , Oask , p).
• Mi signs Odeal and sends it to Cj
(c) Cj signs Odeal and adds it to the OrderBook via Put.addOrders(Odeal )
Settlement
3. The Network checks if the Storage Miners are correctly storing the pieces:
(a) When a Storage Miner fills a sector, they seal it (they create a unique replica) via
Manage.SealSector and submit the proof πSEAL and rt to the blockchain.
(b) Storage Miners generate new proofs at every epoch and add them to the Filecoin
blockchain every ∆proof epochs via Manage.ProveSectors.
(c) The Network runs Manage.RepairOrders at every epoch. If proofs are missing or invalid,
the network tries to repair in the following ways:
• if any proofs are missing or invalid, it penalizes the Storage Miners by taking part
of their collateral,
• if a large amount of proofs are missing or invalid for more than ∆fault epochs, it
considers the Storage Miner faulty, settles the order as failed and reintroduces a new
order for the same piece into the the market,
• if every Storage Miner storing this piece is faulty, then the piece is lost and the client
gets refunded.
4. When the time of the order is expired or funds run out, if the service was correctly provided,
the Network processes the payments, and removes the orders.

5.3.3

The Retrieval Market Protocol

In brief, the Retrieval Market protocol is divided in two phases: order matching and settlement:
• Order Matching: Clients and Retrieval Miners submit their orders to the orderbook by gossiping their
orders (step 1). When orders are matched, the client and the Retrieval Miners establish a micropayment
channel (step 2).
• Settlement: Retrieval Miners send a small parts of the piece to the client and for each piece the client
sends to the miner a signed receipt (step 3). The Retrieval Miner presents the delivery receipts to the
blockchain to get their rewards (step 4).
The protocol is explained in details in Figure 12.
Retrieval Market Protocol
Order Matching:
1. Retrieval Miners and Clients add orders to the Get.OrderBook:
(a) Retrieval Miners Mi creates ask orders (Oask 1 , Oask 2 , ..) and Client Cj creates bid orders
(Obid 1 , Obid 2 , ..).
(b) Both Mi and Cj gossip their orders in the Filecoin network via Get.addOrders
(c) Since there is no commonly shared orderbook, when users receive orders, they add them
to their own orderbook’s view. Differently from the Storage Market, these orders are not
binding and no resource is committed (e.g. clients don’t do any deposit).
2. When orders match, involved parties jointly create Odeal and add it to the Get.OrderBook:
(a) Retrieval Miner Mi and Client Cj independently run Get.matchOrders that queries their
own current Get.OrderBook view.
(b) Both Mi and Cj sign Odeal and add it to their Get.OrderBook via Get.addOrders (as
described before)
(c) Ci and Mj setup a micropayment channel for Odeal
Settlement:
3. Both parties check whether the piece has been delivered:
(a) Mi sends the piece p in parts via Get.SendPieces
(b) Cj receives the p in parts and for each part, Cj acknowledges delivery by sending a
micropayment via Get.ReceivePiece
4. When the p has been received by Cj , Mj can present the micropayments to the network and
retrieve the payment, both parties remove their orders from the orderbooks.

Useful Work Consensus

The Filecoin DSN protocol can be implemented on top of any consensus protocol that allows for verification
of the Filecoin’s proofs. In this section, we present how we can bootstrap a consensus protocol based on
useful work. Instead of wasteful Proof-of-Work computation, the work Filecoin miners do generating Proofof-Spacetime is what allows them to participate in the consensus.
Useful Work. We consider the work done by the miners in a consensus protocol to be useful, if the outcome
of the computation is valuable to the network, beyond securing the blockchain.

6.1

Motivation

While securing the blockchain is of fundamental importance, Proof-of-Work schemes often require solving
puzzles whose solutions are not reusable or require a substantial amount wasteful computation to find.
• Non-reusable Work: Most permissionless blockchains require miners to solve a hard computational
puzzle, such as inverting a hash function. Often the solutions to these puzzles are useless and do not
have any inherent value beyond securing the network. Can we re-purpose this work for something
useful?
Attempts to re-use work: There have been several attempts to re-use mining power for useful computation. Some efforts require miners to perform a special computation alongside the standard Proofof-Work. Other efforts replace Proof-of-Work with useful problems that are still hard to solve. For
example, Primecoin re-uses miners’ computational power to find new prime numbers, Ethereum requires miners to execute small programs alongside with Proof-of-Work, and Permacoin offers archival
services by requiring miners to invert a hash function while proving that some data is being archived.
Although most of these attempts do perform useful work, the amount of wasteful work is still a prevalent factor in these computations.
• Wasteful Work: Solving hard puzzles can be really expensive in terms of cost of machinery and
energy consumed, especially if these puzzles solely rely on computational power. When the mining
algorithm is embarrassingly parallel, then the prevalent factor to solve the puzzle is computational
power. Can we reduce the amount of wasteful work?
Attempts to reduce waste: Ideally, the majority of a network’s resources should be spent on useful work.
Some efforts require miners to use more energy-efficient solutions. For example, Spacemint requires
miners to dedicate disk space rather than computation; while more energy efficient, theses disks are
still “wasted”, since they are filled with random data. Other efforts replace hard to solve puzzles with
a traditional byzantine agreement based on Proof-of-Stake, where stakeholders vote on the next block
proportional to their share of currency in the system.
We set out to design a consensus protocol with a useful work based on storing users’ data.

6.2

Filecoin Consensus

We propose a useful work consensus protocol, where the probability that the network elects a miner to create
a new block (we refer to this as the voting power of the miner) is proportional to their storage currently in
use in relation to the rest of the network. We design the Filecoin protocol such that miners would rather
invest in storage than in computing power to parallelize the mining computation. Miners offer storage and
re-use the computation for proof that data is being stored to participate in the consensus.
6.2.1

Modeling Mining Power

Power Fault Tolerance. In our technical report [13], we present Power Fault Tolerance, an abstraction
that re-frames byzantine faults in terms of participants’ influence over the outcome of the protocol. Every
participant controls some power of which n is the total power in the network, and f is the fraction of power
30

controlled by faulty or adversarial participants.
Power in Filecoin. In Filecoin, the power pti of miner Mi at time t is the sum of the Mi ’s storage assignments. The influence Iit of Mi is the fraction of Mi ’s power over the total power in the network.
In Filecoin, power has the following properties:
• Public: The total amount of storage currently in use in the network is public. By reading the blockchain,
anyone can calculate the storage assignments of each miner - hence anyone can calculate the power of
each miner and the total amount of power at any point in time.
• Publicly Verifiable: For each storage assignment, miners are required to generate Proofs-of-Spacetime,
proving that the service is being provided. By reading the blockchain, anyone can verify if the power
claimed by a miner is correct.
• Variable: At any point in time, miners can add new storage in the network by pledging with a new
sector and filling the sector. In this way, miners can change their amount of power they have through
time.
6.2.2

Accounting for Power with Proof-of-Spacetime

Every ∆proof blocks6 , miners are required to submit Proofs-of-Spacetime to the network, which are only
successfully added to the blockchain if the majority of power in the network considers them valid. At every
block, every full node updates the AllocTable, adding new storage assignments, removing expiring ones and
marking missing proofs.
The power of a miner Mi can be calculated and verified by summing the entries in the AllocTable, which
can be done in two ways:
• Full Node Verification: If a node has the full blockchain log, run the NetworkProtocol from the
genesis block to the current block and read the AllocTable for miner Mi . This process verifies every
Proof-of-Spacetime for the storage currently assigned to Mi .
• Simple Storage Verification: Assume a light client has access to a trusted source that broadcasts
the latest block. A light client can request from nodes in the network: (1) the current AllocTable entry
for miner Mi , (2) a Merkle path that proves that the entry was included in the state tree of the last
block, (3) the headers from the genesis block until the current block. In this way, the light client can
delegate the verification of the Proof-of-Spacetime to the network.
The security of the power calculation comes from the security of Proof-of-Spacetime. In this setting, PoSt
guarantees that the miner cannot lie about the amount of assigned storage they have. Indeed, they cannot
claim to store more than the data they are storing, since this would require spending time fetching and
running the slow PoSt.Setup, and they cannot generates proofs faster by parallelizing the computation, since
PoSt.Prove is a sequential computation.
6.2.3

Using Power to Achieve Consensus

We foresee multiple strategies for implementing the Filecoin consensus by extending existing (and future)
Proof-of-Stake consensus protocols, where stake is replaced with assigned storage. While we foresee improvements in Proof-of-Stake protocols, we propose a construction based on our previous work called Expected
Consensus [14]. Our strategy is to elect at every round one (or more) miners, such that the probability of
winning an election is proportional to each miner’s assigned storage.
Expected Consensus. The basic intuition of Expected Consensus EC is to deterministically, unpredictably,
and secretly elect a small set of leaders at each epoch. On expectation, the number of elected leaders per
6∆

proof

is a system parameter.

31

epoch is 1, but some epochs may have zero or many leaders. Leaders extend the chain by creating a block and
propagating it to the network. At each epoch, the chain is extended with one or multiple blocks. In case of a
leaderless epoch, an empty block is added to the chain. Although the blocks in chain can be linearly ordered,
its data structure is a direct acyclic graph. EC is a probabilistic consensus, where each epoch introduces
more certainty over previous blocks, eventually reaching enough certainty that the likelihood of a different
history is sufficiently small. A block is committed if the majority of the participants add their weight on the
chain where the block belongs to, by extending the chain or by signing blocks.
Electing Miners. At every epoch, each miner checks if they are elected leader, this is done similarly to
previous protocols: CoA [15], Snow White [16], and Algorand [17].
Definition 6.1. (EC Election in Filecoin) A miner Mi is a leader at time t if the following condition is met:
H



t||rand(t)


Mi

/2L ≤

pti
Σj ptj

Where rand(t) is a public randomness available that can be extracted from the blockchain at epoch t, pti
is the power of Mi . Consider the size of H(m) to be L for any m, H to be a secure cryptographic hash
function and hmiMi to be a message m signed by Mi , such that:



hmiMi := (m), SIGMi H(m)
In Figure 13, we describe the protocol between a miner (ProveElect) and a network node (VerifyElect).
This election scheme provides three properties: fairness, secrecy and public verifiability.
• Fairness: each participant has only one trial for each election, since signatures are deterministic and t
and rand(t) are fixed. Assuming H is a secure cryptographic hash function, then H(ht||rand(t)iMi )/2L
must be a real number uniformly chosen from (0, 1). Hence, the probability for the equation to be
true must be pti /Σj ptj , which is equal to the miner’s portion of power within the network. Because this
probability is linear in power, this likelihood is preserved under splitting or pooling power. Note that
the random value rand(t) is not known before time t.
• Secret: an efficient adversary that does not own the secret key Mi can compute the signature with
negligible probability, given the assumptions of digital signatures.
• Public Verifiability: an elected leader i ∈ Lt can convince a efficient verifier by showing t, rand(t),
H(ht||rand(t)ii )/2L ; given the previous point, no efficient adversary can generate a proof without
having a winning secret key.

Smart Contracts

Filecoin provides two basic primitives to the end users: Get and Put. These primitives allow clients to store
data and retrieve data from the markets at their preferred price. While the primitives cover the default use
cases for Filecoin, we enable for more complex operations to be designed on top of Get and Put by supporting a deployment of smart contracts. Users can program new fine-grained storage/retrieval requests that
we classify as File Contracts as well as generic Smart Contracts. We integrate a Contracts system (based
on [18]) and a Bridge system to bring Filecoin storage in other blockchain, and viceversa, to bring other
blockchains’ functionalities in Filecoin.
We expect a plethora of smart contracts to exist in the Filecoin ecosystem and we look forward to a community
of smart-contract developers.

7.1

Contracts in Filecoin

Smart Contracts enable users of Filecoin to write stateful programs that can spend tokens, request storage/retrieval of data in the markets and validate storage proofs. Users can interact with the smart contracts
by sending transactions to the ledger that trigger function calls in the contract. We extend the Smart Contract system to support Filecoin specific operations (e.g. market operations, proof verification).
Filecoin supports contracts specific to data storage, as well as more generic smart contracts:
• File Contracts: We allow users to program the conditions for which they are offering or providing
storage services. There are several examples worth mentioning: (1) contracting miners: clients can
specify in advance the miners offering the service without participating in the market, (2) payment
strategies: clients can design different reward strategies for the miners, for example a contract can pay
the miner incresignly higher through time, another contract can set the price of storage informed by
a trusted oracle, (3) ticketing services: a contract could allow a miner to deposit tokens and to pay
for storage/retrieval on behalf of their users, (4) more complex operations: clients can create contracts
that allow for data update.
• Smart Contracts: Users can associate programs to their transactions like in other systems (as in
Ethereum [18]) which do not directly depend on the use of storage. We foresee applications such as:
decentralized naming systems, asset tracking and crowdsale platforms.

7.2

Integration with other systems

Bridges are tools that aim at connecting different blockchains; while still work in progress, we plan to support
cross chain interaction in order to bring the Filecoin storage in other blockchain-based platforms as well as
bringing functionalities from other platforms into Filecoin.
• Filecoin in other platforms: Other blockchain systems such as Bitcoin [19], Zcash [20] and in
particular Ethereum [18] and Tezos, allow developers to write smart contracts; however, these platforms
provide very little storage capability and at a very high cost. We plan to provide a bridge to bring
storage and retrieval support to these platforms. We note that IPFS is already in use by several
smart contracts (and protocol tokens) as a way to reference and distribute content. Adding support
to Filecoin would allow these systems to guarantee storage of IPFS content in exchange of Filecoin
tokens.
• Other platforms in Filecoin: We plan to provide bridges to connect other blockchain services with
Filecoin. For example, integration with Zcash would allow support for sending requests for storing
data in privacy.

Future Work

This work presents a clear and cohesive path toward the construction of the Filecoin network; however, we
also consider this work to be a starting point for future research on decentralized storage systems. In this
section we identify and populate three categories of future work. This includes work that has been completed
and merely awaits description and publication, open questions for improving the current protocols, and
formalization of the protocol.

8.1

On-going Work

The following topics represent ongoing work.
• A specification of the Filecoin state tree in every block.
• Detailed performance estimates and benchmarks for Filecoin and its components.
• A full implementable Filecoin protocol specification.
• A sponsored-retrieval ticketing model where any client C1 can sponsor the download of another client
C2 by issuing per-piece bearer-spendable tokens.
• A Hierarchical Consensus protocol where Filecoin subnets can partition and continue processing transactions during temporary or permanent partitions.
• Incremental blockchain snapshotting using SNARK/STARK
• Filecoin-in-Ethereum interface contracts and protocols.
• Blockchain archives and inter-blockchain stamping with Braid.
• Only post Proofs-of-Spacetime on the blockchain for conflict resolution.
• Formally prove the realizations of the Filecoin DSN and the novel Proofs-of-Storage.

8.2

Open Questions

There are a number of open questions whose answers have the potential to substantially improve the network
as a whole, despite the fact that none of them have to be solved before launch.
• A better primitive for the Proof-of-Replication Seal function, which ideally is O(n) on decode (not
O(nm)) and publicly-verifiable without requiring SNARK/STARK.
• A better primitive for the Proof-of-Replication Prove function, which is publicly-verifiable and transparent without SNARK/STARK.
• A transparent, publicly-verifiable Proof-of-Retrievability or other Proof-of-Storage.
• New strategies for retrieval in the Retrieval Market (e.g. based on probabilistic payments, zero knowledge contingent payments)
• A better secret leader election for the Expected Consensus, which gives exactly one elected leader per
epoch.
• A better trusted setup scheme for SNARKs that allows incremental expansion of public parameters
(schemes where a sequence of MPCs can be run, where each additional MPC strictly lowers probability
of faults and where the output of each MPC is usable for a system).

34

8.3

Proofs and Formal Verification

Because of the clear value of proofs and formal verification, we plan to prove many properties of the Filecoin
network and develop formally verified protocol specifications in the coming months and years. A few proofs
are in progress and more in mind. But it will be hard, long-term work to prove many properties of Filecoin
(such as scaling, offline).
• Proofs of correctness for Expected Consensus and variants.
• Proof of correctness for Power Fault Tolerance asynchronous 1/2 impossibility result side-step.
• Formulate the Filecoin DSN in the universal composability framework, describing Get, Put and Manage
as ideal functionalities and prove our realizations.
• Formal model and proofs for automatic self-healing guarantees.
• Formally verify protocol descriptions (e.g. TLA+ or Verdi).
• Formally verify implementations (e.g. Verdi).
• Game theoretical analysis of Filecoin’s incentives.

1. Executive Summary

Prediction markets are poised to become one of the most disruptive innovations in capital markets
and data science since the beginning of the Information Revolution. First proposed in the early 90s,
prediction markets have yet to attract mass attention in the realm of forecasting and decision-making
despite their documented efficacy for information aggregation. This is largely due to over-regulation
in many of the world’s leading financial sectors. With the invention of powerful, peer-to-peer
computing technologies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, the scientific exploration of market-based
forecasting can proceed uninhibited and at a rate and scale previously unimaginable. Our team
believes undoubtedly that prediction markets will disrupt some of the largest existing industries in
the near term. Looking forward, we expect that the Gnosis prediction market platform will form the
basis for machine information economies on a global scale.
In order for a prediction market platform to become truly disruptive, it must be universal and
draw from a global liquidity pool. The platform must be decentralized, permissionless, and trustless
for such a liquidity pool to exist. With these requirements in mind, the Gnosis team has selected the
Ethereum network as the core protocol upon which the platform will be built.

1.1

Problem Overview
Generally speaking, the Information Revolution has made it easier for individuals to quickly retrieve
data about any topic. Despite the ease of access we enjoy today, this form of information aggregation
still requires a great deal of coordination to be effective. More often than not, the data is severely
lacking in context and objectivity and requires heavier lifting to produce actionable information
for use in decision-making processes. The reason for this is straightforward: written information
is inextricably linked to the writer’s individual biases and agenda, making it difficult to delineate
useful information from opinions or intentional misinformation. In other words, it’s easy to find
what people have said but hard to ascertain what they actually believe.
Financial markets are particularly interesting in this regard in that the act of speculation elicits a
highly effective form of information aggregation that requires no coordination (i.e. the “invisible
hand”) and more closely mirrors individual beliefs. Principally, market speculators who believe they

Chapter 1. Executive Summary

have superior information buy shares when they believe a company is undervalued and sell shares
when they believe the company is overvalued. A monetary incentive exists to “update” a common
data point (i.e. share price) when there is profit potential, and there is a disincentive to misreport in
the form of financial loss. The resulting equilibrium share price reflects the prevailing market-wide
sentiment about a company’s value at any given time. In summary, information aggregation occurs
with skin in the game - a characteristic that:
1. effectively glues an individual’s action to their privately held beliefs and
2. is absent from other methods for information aggregation such as polling.
This is vital for understanding the principal function of prediction markets.
A prediction market, in essence, is a vehicle for aggregating information about the expected
outcome of a future event.1 Unlike a traditional financial market, prediction markets frame themselves
as questions about the future, typically with binary outcomes. For example: Which presidential
candidate will win the 2016 election? Shares are divided among pre-defined options (e.g. Hillary
Clinton, Donald Trump, Other) with corresponding share prices equaling $1. Each option’s share
price reflects its probability of occurrence. So long as an individual believes they have superior
information about the event in question, s/he has an incentive to purchase shares that reflect his/her
beliefs about the outcome, thereby updating information captured by the prediction market. At the
market’s conclusion, the winning option’s shares become redeemable for $1, while all other shares
become worthless. Individual actors who purchased the winning shares receive profit equal to $1 purchase price x number of shares.
Ex: Which presidential candidate will win the 2016 election?
(A) Hillary Clinton ($0.40) = 40% chance of winning
(B) Donald Trump ($0.50) = 50% chance of winning
(C) Other ($0.10) = 10% chance of winning
(A) + (B) + (C) = $1.00 (100%)
Over the last several decades, prediction markets have seen a surge in use due to their superior
ability to effectively aggregate all available information relevant to an event’s outcome. Prediction
markets have already been implemented with success for a variety of applications. Initially, these
markets were limited to academic purposes, the first of which being the Foresight Exchange. Later,
prediction markets were tested by the intelligence industry through projects such as DARPA’s FutureMAP, which was, “an experiment to see whether market-generated predictions could improve
upon conventional approaches to forecasting.” Perhaps most straightforward and general was Intrade’s prediction market, which allowed for event futures on the outcome of decidable events such
as elections, current events, and sports. During its existence, Intrade showed that such markets could
garner significant volume and estimate the likelihood of potential outcomes with greater accuracy
than traditional polling methods. More recently, prediction markets have found use as internal tools
to inform organizations, such as large corporations and nonprofits.
Prediction markets have limited accessibility, liquidity, and market variety resulting from strict
financial and gaming regulation in the U.S. that extends well-beyond the country’s borders. In 2012,
Ireland-based Intrade was sued by the CFTC in violation of its ban on off-exchange options trading,
leading to the site’s ultimate closure in March 2013.2 Per the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act, it is
illegal to solicit U.S. based customers to buy and sell commodity options unless classified as exempt
or listed on a CFTC-regulated exchange. Intrade’s sudden closure raised suspicions about market

markets

1.2 Mission Statement

manipulation and around claims about its markets’ liquidity.3 Similarly, prediction markets have been
met with resistance within corporate environments. Despite evidence of early successes for corporate
decision making in forward-thinking organizations such as Google, prediction markets have failed to
garner popular support from product/project managers for a variety of reasons, including manager
bias, organizational friction, and a lack of well-established guidelines for facilitating successful
internal markets.
Despite the aforementioned challenges, prediction markets have seen a resurgence of interest
both in academia and the private sector. More recently, New Zealand-based prediction market
PredictIt has been able to operate under the benediction of the CFTC, albeit with severe limitations.
PredictIt positions itself as “an experimental research and educational facility of Victoria University
of Wellington,” rather than a betting site. Pursuant to a letter of non-action received from the CFTC
in October 2014, the platform’s markets are restricted to 5,000 total traders per contract, with a
limit on individual investment of $850.4 Furthermore, use of the platform is illegal in the states of
Washington and Nevada.
We must face a hard truth that prediction markets, despite being rigorously tested, cuttingedge instruments for forecasting the future, will never reach their full potential if built on 21st
century database technologies. Traditional prediction market applications that operate on centralized
platforms will tend towards proprietary designs, siloing data and reducing overall liquidity - a recipe
for impotent markets that leave much to be desired in terms of accuracy and precision. Furthermore,
these databases lack the resilience necessary to resist censorship and reach untapped liquidity pools
across the globe, the effect of which suffocates any prediction market’s viability as a platform and
stunts its growth as a means of information exchange. Because these efficient, flexible, and scalable
markets for specialized information exchange do not yet exist, investors and speculators are forced to
accept the high costs associated with constructing custom financial instruments in highly regulated
environments.

1.2

Mission Statement
“Our mission is to build an accessible prediction market platform enabling the free
flow of useful information.”
Gnosis will be a disruptive force driving change in a number of systemically important global
markets, including finance, gambling, insurance, and information. Gnosis prediction markets will
also find applications in new forms of distributed, market-based governance protocols, and will
provide unique incentivization opportunities for both local and global economies.
Gnosis is well-positioned as a medium for a long-term shift toward information arbitrage
economies that will power the Internet of Things, as well as more advanced forms of artificial
intelligence. We believe that we are on the cusp of a Cambrian explosion of machine intelligence
that will leverage a global liquidity pool of information for decision-making and will be deeply
interwoven on a shared blockchain fabric such as Ethereum. Decentralized prediction markets seeded
on Gnosis will be the ideal medium of exchange for these intelligent agents.

1.3.2

Create the “Google” of Customized Information Searching
Gnosis enables anyone to ask a question and fund the search for answers. This creates new economic
opportunities for subject matter experts and more efficient avenues for crowdsourcing and aggregating
information. The power of “search” is decentralized and inclusive.

1.3.3

Become the Standard for Predictive Assets
Gnosis seeks to establish a global, open prediction market platform with a single liquidity pool.
This limitless resource enables the simple creation of custom prediction market applications and
embodies a flexible marketplace for blockchain oracle services.

2. Token Mechanism

The token sold during the token launch is known as the Gnosis Token, or GNO. This is the only time
that these tokens can be created, and therefore the total supply of GNO is fixed.
Fees, similar to those of a trading market, will be charged to participants on the Gnosis Services
and Applications layers (but as a reminder, not the bare bones Core layer). These fees will initially
be denominated in cryptocurrency, namely BTC or ETH. Gnosis seeks to not only create interesting
software, but also a community of those interested in sharing their wisdom on Gnosis markets. To do
this, we needed to create a model that lowers the barrier to entry for repeat users (e.g. having to pay
BTC/ETH repeatedly). Therefore, in addition to paying this fee in BTC or ETH, Gnosis ecosystem
participants will be able to pay the fee in Wisdom, or WIZ, tokens.
Gnosis Wisdom (WIZ) can be used to pay platform fees on the Services layer, subsidize the fees
of other participants, provide initial subsidies for markets, or for market trading. WIZ will be pegged
to $1 USD worth of fees. In this way, WIZ acts as a coupon for $1 of use within Gnosis.
Gnosis tokens (GNO) are the generator for Wisdom token (WIZ) creation. WIZ can only be
created via activating the utility of the Gnosis (GNO) tokens. This is done via a smart contract
system. The smart contract works as follows: GNO token holders agree to “lock” their tokens in a
smart contract (30-365 days). A multiplier is added for longer lock durations. The smart contract
determines the user selected lock duration and applies that duration to a formula that is designed
to regulate the supply of WIZ tokens currently in use. Prior to locking their GNO tokens in the
smart contract, users will be able to see exactly how much WIZ they will receive as a result of
executing the smart contract. Once users execute the contract, 30% of their WIZ will be distributed
for immediate use, and the remaining 70% will be distributed proportionally over the locked duration.
Once the lock duration expires, the locked GNO ceases to generate WIZ and the GNO becomes
freely transferable by the holder. There is no limit (other than duration) for how many times GNO
tokens may be used to create WIZ.
How Can Gnosis Remain Viable if Participants Choose Not to Pay in WIZ?
A core value proposition of Gnosis (and decentralization) is to guarantee future characteristics
of platforms to both users and developers without relying on the trustworthiness of an operating
company. In order to do this, elements including fee rates, must be codified into the software itself. It

12

Chapter 2. Token Mechanism

is expected that WIZ will be the overwhelmingly predominant method for paying fees in the Gnosis
ecosystem. In the unexpected event that this is not true, and users are paying in BTC or /ETH, the
platform may become vulnerable to low-fee copycats or potentially even illegal forks of the Gnosis
codebase.
These alternative platforms may logically cause erosion of the Gnosis userbase, subsequently
triggering justified loss of developer confidence that their created markets and applications will
remain viable on Gnosis. In order to avoid this scenario, we designed a fee-reduction mechanism to
bolster competitiveness of the Gnosis platform. The result is added confidence for developers and
partners that Gnosis is the infrastructure they should be building markets on.
NOTE: It is unlikely that this mechanism will be used as game theory and expectations point to
users predominantly paying fees in WIZ. In the event this mechanism is triggered, we expect the
occurrence to be extremely rare.
Two core requirements for the fee reduction mechanism is that it is both decentralized and costly.
The mechanism must be costly in order to eliminate spam or manipulation. The core functionality of
the mechanism is as follows: All fees paid in BTC/ETH/Tokens go to an auction contract outside the
control of the Gnosis team. If fees exist in the auction contract, any GNO token holder can submit
a bid, bidding their held GNO against some amount of fees contained in the auction contract. If
the bid is accepted, the GNO will then enter the auction contract and the user will receive the fees
specified. When the user’s GNO enters the auction contract, the fee reduction mechanism will be
triggered causing a reduction in fees on Gnosis proportional to the total amount of GNO held in this
auction contract. The auction contract is one-way and GNO cannot leave this wallet.

Figure 2.1: Examples of GNO and WIZ Utility

3. Platform Model

The Gnosis platform will be composed of three primary layers: Core, Services, and Application.

Figure 3.1: Primary layers of the Gnosis platform

3.1
3.1.1

Gnosis Layers
Layer One: Gnosis Core
The Core layer provides the foundational smart contracts for Gnosis use: event token creation and
settlement, a market mechanism, oracle, and a management interface. This layer is and always will
be free and open to use. Creating new markets is near zero marginal cost, and to remain competitive
fees will have to approach zero. Instead of grasping at the maximum possible fees while remaining
competitive, we feel that it is prudent to eliminate fees at the most basic contract level. It should be in

Chapter 3. Platform Model

14

every party’s best interest to use the existing open source and feeless contracts instead of deploying
their own version.
3.1.2

Layer Two: Gnosis Services
The Gnosis Services layer will offer additional services on top of Gnosis Core and will use a trading
fee model. These services will include a state channel implementation1 , new market mechanisms,
stablecoin and payment processor integrations, open source template applications, application
customization tools, and the oracle marketplace. More features may be introduced as deemed useful.
These components are necessary for most consumer applications building on Gnosis.
State channels are a prerequisite for betting and financial applications requiring thousands or
more transactions per second. Without stablecoins, market participants are subject to the volatility
of the cryptocurrency which the market is denominated in and the event outcome that they are
predicting. Application templates, customization tools, and advanced oracle selection will allow us
to execute on our vision of lowering the barrier to entry for new prediction market based applications
by at least two orders of magnitude. While some applications and participants will interact with
Gnosis on the Core level, we are confident that these services will provide a compelling reason for
Services level use.

3.1.3

Layer Three: Gnosis Applications
On top of the Services layer (or in some cases, just Gnosis Core) is the Gnosis application layer.
These applications are primarily front-ends that target a particular prediction market use case and or
customer segment. Some of these applications may be built by Gnosis, while others will be built by
third parties. Our vision for Gnosis is to have a wide variety of prediction market applications built
atop the same platform and liquidity pool. These applications will likely charge additional fees or
use alternative business models such as market making, information selling, or advertising. As we’ll
see in the next section on tokens, many Gnosis applications may include token holding as a core
component of their business model.

4. Gnosis Applications

With the Gnosis prediction market platform serving as a global liquidity hub, decentralized application developers will be able to create new classes of predictive assets that can be used in any number
of simple or complex applications. The following section will introduce a set of innovations that are
readily implementable in existing markets with the use of Gnosis prediction markets. It will also
attempt to define entirely new verticals that are made possible through the use of predictive assets.

4.1

Financial Instruments
Prediction markets can enable the creation of financial instruments that track stock price or commodity value with greater specificity than existing derivatives. If we conceptualize traditional financial
instruments as expressions of economic value, one could argue that the “expressiveness” of current
market offerings is limited to statements of ownership in an asset (e.g. currencies, equities), of
financial relationships between economic entities (e.g. bonds), and meta-statements about value
relative to an instrument (e.g. derivatives). Prediction markets enable more nuanced and specific
expressions about economic events, which in turn signal value more explicitly (along with risk) at
both the macro and micro-economic level.
For example, markets can be created asking, “What will this corporation’s Q4 gross revenue
be on a specified date?” One might imagine that information drawn from this and many adjacent
markets could be used as an input to inform more advanced predictive/decision-making models
in finance, government, insurance, and beyond. Such a market could inform analysts’ earnings
per share (EPS) estimates for the quarter; alternatively, markets can be constructed to predict EPS
itself, sidestepping the need for analyst forecasts altogether. More readily available and reliable
information in this area can lead to better price discovery, minimizing both short-term volatility and
long-term risk.
Alternatively, prediction markets can be used to create pegged and stable currencies. For example,
an EtherUSD currency can be implemented by creating a scalar market which asks, “What will
the Ether/USD exchange rate be at a future date?” Liquidity from this market can then be used to
offer EtherUSD tokens which are pegged to the USD value. These tokens would be sold at a small

Chapter 4. Gnosis Applications

16

Figure 4.1: Financial Instruments: Predicting EPS
markup dependent on the cost of the market to provide liquidity. In another case, stable currencies
(currencies designed to have stable value) can be constructed by taking a basket of positions in both
sides of many markets.
While these synthetic instruments seem somewhat complex in nature, they illustrate the diverse
applicability of prediction markets in finance and represent a tremendous economic opportunity for a
diverse set of local experts in a truly global environment.

4.2

Insurance & Hedging Instruments
As stated previously, highly liquid prediction markets are remarkably accurate in assessing the
likelihood of future events and therefore signaling associated risks. In the context of insurance, a
prediction market could be used to estimate the likelihood of an insured event and may serve as an
input to or even replace certain actuarial models. For example, a home insurance policy could create
a market asking, “Will this area flood in the next year?” or “Will an earthquake over 5.0 magnitude
occur within 50 miles of this location?” Probabilities drawn from these markets can effectively
approximate more sophisticated actuarial estimates that require highly specialized (i.e. expensive)
training. In our case, risk measurement becomes democratized, creating new economic opportunities
for any participants with valuable localized knowledge.

4.3 Information

17

Figure 4.2: Hedging risks: Travel insurance
Furthermore, an insurance policy can be automated by creating smart contracts which buy “Yes”
positions in each market affecting policy risk. In theory, shares in “Yes” positions should pay out an
amount equal to or greater than the projected damage if an event occurs. The cost to the consumer
for these contracts should be equal to the cost of all shares for their policy, plus some markup so that
the insurance decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) may profit. The Gnosis Oracle Market
serves as a hub for claim inspectors to offer their inspection services to settle outstanding claims.
This insurance method should result in lower costs to the consumer as it automates business and
accounting functions and crowdsources the actuarial process, as well as claims inspection.

4.3

Information
Prediction market applications for information sales can be broken into two major categories: sales
of insider information, and sales of device data.
The sale of insider information has incredibly high utility but is ethically and legally questionable.
For example, a market could be created asking, “Will corporation A acquire corporation B within
set time frame?” In an anonymous prediction market, traders with insider information (e.g. high
level executives in corporation A) could participate in this market for an almost guaranteed profit.
The benefit of these types of markets is that they offer real-time access to all information relevant
to a corporation’s value, leading to more accurate pricing and strong-form efficient markets. The
downside, however, is that such markets can sidestep existing SEC regulation that prevent insiders
from individually profiting on material, nonpublic information. In the coming years, we will observe
the interplay between new information markets and the incumbent financial system. We expect

18

Chapter 4. Gnosis Applications

regulators to continue to adapt its restrictive regime around insider information for prediction markets
but with much difficulty given the decentralized nature of competing, blockchain-based platforms.
What we may witness by way of response from the market is a stronger trend towards financial
transparency by default, which arguably shrinks the pool of profitable insider information and
introduces greater efficiency into global markets.

Figure 4.3: Information gathering: Gauging the price of a piece of art before the auction is vital for
auction houses. Prediction markets can garner the expertise of specialists.

The latter example of device data sales may result in more efficient Internet of Things (IoT)
optimizations, but it requires prediction market scaling tools (e.g. state channels) to achieve high
frequency participation with low transaction cost. An example of this application could be smart
cars participating in a market asking, “What is the traffic speed at this location?” Such a market
resembles something like Waze, a consumer GPS navigation application, but for machine-to-machine
interactions, providing a profit opportunity for sensor devices reporting probability estimates used to
directly optimize IoT operations. In the prior example, markets on traffic speed would be used for
driverless car routing or by third party maps services.

4.4 Governance

4.4

19

Governance
Decision making is at the core of all governance models. Organizations must make decisions on
which policies to implement in order to maximize future welfare. For a government, this could mean
deciding how to budget annual tax revenues among competing policy initiatives. Take, for example,
the following questions:
“Should a portion of the budget be allocated for infrastructure projects or for education? Which
option will result in greater GDP?”
Within a corporation, many decisions must be made over the course of a fiscal year, with
variations in frequency, time sensitivity, and value to the firm. Disputes can arise within a broad
class of decisions at all levels of a company, many of which can be catastrophic if poorly executed,
such as a decision about whether or not to acquire a competitor. In most cases of governance, such
decisions are made using a hybrid of democratic and autocratic processes. The former involves a
voting process in which members of an organization or government cast votes (allocated through an
egalitarian or proportional representation) where a plurality, majority, or supermajority is required to
implement a decision. The latter involves a hierarchical model in which designated individuals make
absolute decisions over their domains of control. Metrics on share price or future revenue may be the
deciding factors for evaluating the resulting performance at a later date. Both of these models suffer
from information and coordination inefficiencies, often resulting in the implementation of policies
and actions that poorly optimize organizational welfare.
Futarchy, coined by Robin Hanson of George Mason University, offers an alternative, marketbased approach to governance. In futarchy, markets are used to decide on and implement policies.
These markets follow a general form of:
“What will a future welfare metric be if a policy is implemented?”
For example, a corporation could ask, “What will our Q4 revenue be if we fire our CEO?”
(Market A) and conversely, “What will our Q4 revenue be if we don’t fire our CEO?” (Market B).
We can refer to these bi-directional markets as decision markets. Speculators who believe they hold
unique insights into the outcome of firing or keeping the CEO are incentivized to participate in both
markets. If the speculator believes that revenue will be maximized by firing the CEO, then he/she
will buy long shares in the company’s expected revenue [E(r)] if the CEO is fired and short shares
in the E(r) if the CEO is not fired. Upon market closure, a decision is made corresponding to the
greater expected outcome. In our CEO example, if the market value for Market A E(r) is greater than
Market B E(r), then the organization fires the CEO. Market participants are then rewarded depending
on their accuracy in predicting future revenue.
In this model, governance is both marketized and automated. Policies are determined by values
found on an open market and implemented either through bonded delegates or an automated process.
Prediction markets have shown to be the most efficient information aggregation tool, lending credence
to the hypothesis that futarchy can more accurately identify policies that will optimize outcomes
while also lowering bureaucratic overhead.

4.5

Incentivization
Apart from estimating event probabilities, prediction markets can be used to incentivize actions in
the real world. An agent wishing to incentivize an action creates a market asking “Has a particular
event occurred?” or “Will this event occur at a particular date?” Following the creation of these
markets, the creator aggressively buys shares in the “No” outcome. Assume a participant observes

20

Chapter 4. Gnosis Applications

the prediction market and believes he/she can implement the action described. By buying “Yes”
shares at low cost in the market, this participant is effectively guaranteeing payment if they can
complete the action, resolving the market in their favor.
An example of this applied mechanism is a market for zero-day software security exploits. In this
case, a company could ask, “Will a zero-day exploit be discovered in our software?” A penetration
tester would attempt to discover exploits in the software. If an exploit is found, the tester would
buy shares in the market for “Yes, an exploit will be discovered,” and then reveal the exploit, either
directly to the company by openly releasing the exploit or by using it in practice. For this particular
application, the company would likely benefit from creating a secondary smart contract which pays
the tester an additional amount for revealing the exploit privately to them.
This mechanism of incentivizing actions extends similarly to any event whose outcome can be
heavily influenced by market participants. A use case which we find particularly interesting is the
automated political action committee (PAC). A PAC raises money for the purpose of influencing an
election or legislation. Through a combination of prediction markets and smart contracts, we can
automate this process. First, a smart contract is created which is designated to impact a particular
political outcome. Actors may donate money to this contract.
Following this, a market is created asking, “Will this legislation pass?” The PAC smart contract
(smartPAC) spends its funds to buy shares in “No” (this will not pass). This effectively creates an
incentive for actors to buy shares in “Yes” with the intent to impact the legislation positively and
profit. If the legislation passes, then the smartPAC has achieved its purpose. If the legislation does
not pass, then the contract profits from its positions in the market. This profit is then retained to be
used for a future market created the next time similar legislation is proposed. Funds are rolled over
similarly until the legislation passes. Effectively, this creates an ever increasing incentive to pass the
legislation.

4.6

Sports Betting

Figure 4.4: Using prediction markets for sports betting

4.6 Sports Betting

21

Global online sports gaming is a massive market, with at least high 100s of billions wagered
through regulated markets, and some estimate shows that 10 times that volume goes through
unregulated markets. Companies such as William Hill make over 1B in revenue yearly. Despite this
massive opportunity, companies and governments have been slow to innovate on existing models.
Existing applications operate on siloed data and liquidity pools, have limited accessibility, and
are slow to bring new products to market. Additionally, with centralized services, the user incurs
additional risk such as theft or other failure, and unexpected issues with payment processors.
Two major impediments contribute to this situation. The first is that becoming a new entrant to
the gaming market is a costly endeavor, with startup costs for a new company being at least in the
several millions. Another major roadblock is the aforementioned siloing and accessibility issues.
Without open, equitable, and transparent access to markets, products can not offer a platform model
promoting innovation, and odds suffer.
Gnosis brings innovations that aim to solve these problems. Gnosis operates as an open platform,
where access is unbiased and transparent. Thanks to this, incumbents and new participants can safely
reap the rewards of operating on the same platform, such as added liquidity translating to better
odds. Gnosis can be accessed anywhere and provides the same markets to all parties. Additionally,
our platform provides the majority of back-end logic necessary for a new application, lowering the
barrier of entry for new entrants by at least 2 orders of magnitude.

5. Roadmap

Key Activities & Partnerships
• Gnosis has been live on the Ethereum Mainnet for over 18 months. We updated to the next
major software release in August. Gnosis was described by Vitalik as most advanced DApp
currently live on main net in early 2016 interview
• Substantial work has been performed toward state channels and scaling. By implementing
state channels into our software architecture, Gnosis is pioneering one of the most important
tools for scaling DApps on the blockchain
• Ramping up community engagement efforts. Massive growth in social media following.
Surpassed 1000 slack members and 2500 Twitter followers. Gnosis is actively pursuing high
profile partnerships within Ethereum ecosystem, financial sector, and other fields.

5.2

Competitive Analysis
Gnosis competes directly with blockchain-based prediction market platform, Augur. Table 5.1
highlights the differences between the two platforms at a high level. The following section seeks
to expound the differences between the two offerings in greater detail. It is also worth noting that
Gnosis competes indirectly with sports betting exchanges and option markets such as William Hill
and Nadex, respectively.
Gnosis differentiates itself from Augur in a few important ways. First and foremost, Gnosis is
positioned as a platform for building decentralized prediction market applications as opposed to
simply being a hub for market-making activity. The distinction is subtle but represents a wholly
different strategic approach to capturing the burgeoning predictive asset market; the value proposition
of the former centers itself on the production of actionable information, while the latter centers itself
on generating data. Although Gnosis invests heavily in the development of its trading engine, crucial
to Gnosis’ mission and thesis is the transformation of this large set of prediction market data points
into meaningful information that can be utilized by human and AI decision-making agents. In order
to make this a reality, Gnosis plans on focusing a significant amount of resources towards enabling
the creation of decentralized prediction market applications that make it simpler and easier for users

24

Chapter 5. Roadmap

to gain insights into complex topics and make more well-informed decisions.
The platforms also differ in their mechanisms for resolving market outcomes. Augur’s design is
fully decentralized and requires Reputation (REP) token holders to allocate a certain portion of time
per month for reporting event outcomes. The result is a resolution process that is theoretically more
difficult to game but suffers from slow payouts. Taking this cost as a significant point of friction that
may hamper the speed of prediction market adoption, Gnosis made an important design decision to
create an oracle solution that is centralized by default and features a truly decentralized failsafe. This
mechanism enables quicker resolutions via specialized, reputation-backed oracle services offered
through Gnosis’ oracle marketplace without sacrificing the benefits of decentralization.

Figure 5.1: Comparison between Gnosis and Augur
The trajectories of each platform also differ, at least in part, when considering the ongoing
research that is being conducted around long-term scalability and market-based governance. With
respect to scalability, blockchain-based prediction markets that aim to serve data-hungry IoT applications will suffer from prohibitive transaction costs due to the high frequency of requests. While
protocol-level scaling solutions (i.e. sharding) are still in development, Gnosis has committed
resources towards investigating off-chain scaling solutions such as state channels, which enable
verifiable, on-chain settlement of large volume transactional events that is cost-effective. Gnosis
identifies its active leadership in state channel research as a significant competitive advantage in the
decentralized prediction market space precisely because it enables decentralization at scale. Any
first mover advantage captured by Augur in the Ethereum space will be quickly outpaced once
platform scaling becomes the primary concern. In addition, Gnosis was awarded a grant by the
Ethereum Foundation to conduct research on market-based governance, known as futarchy (detailed
in Ongoing Research below). Selection by leading scientists in the blockchain field further signals
the overall strength of the Gnosis leadership team.

Use of Sale Proceeds
Platform Development

Platform development will include building upon and securing core smart contracts, additional
frameworks such as a comprehensive oracle market, trading and management interfaces, service
level app templates and customization tools, and integrations with future Ethereum infrastructure
such as state channels and stablecoins.
Legal Costs

Legal requirements include corporate setups in at least 3 locations for crowdsale, operations, and
gaming licenses. Work has been done prior to token launch with a US law firm to develop a legal
opinion of the interpretation with US law. Ongoing resources will be required for gaming and
possible financial use case legal work. A legal contingency fund will be reserved in case of future
issues.

Marketing and Business Development

Business development efforts will be focused on identifying and forming relationships with new
projects and existing partnerships which can be built on Gnosis. Marketing will be focused on
marketing Gnosis applications to their potential customer segment. Additional efforts will be spent
on increasing awareness and knowledge of the Gnosis platform and what can be built with it.

5.4
5.4.1

Development Roadmap
Current State
Gnosis has been under development for over two years starting at the beginning of January 2015.
Since then there were multiple iterations over the core parts of Gnosis. This includes the smart
contracts powering the framework as well as the general web interface and the gnosis.js library.
Several integrations of Gnosis with other projects like uPort, MetaMask or RealityKeys have been
tested. In addition to developing Gnosis core infrastructure Gnosis has been developing other
products like the Gnosis multisig wallet (https://wallet.gnosis.pm), which is used by several
projects (Golem, Weifund, Stable, ...) setting a standard for secure fund management. Gnosis is
also involved in development of developer tools and developed the first version of a program, which
turned into the widely used TestRPC.

5.4.2

Future Development
Throughout the preparation of the token auction, development of core Gnosis technology continued
making sure that next iterations can be published in time.
2017 Q2:

• Additional office in Berlin
Parts of the team will join the vibrant Ethereum community in Berlin, working out of the
ETHDEV office.
• gnosis.js beta & smart contracts beta
gnosis.js is an easy-to-use tool to enable every website developer to build applications on
top of Gnosis. gnosis.js will integrate with redesigned, more modular smart contracts and
GnosisDB as only backend.
• Gnosis management interface beta
A new interface to create and maintain markets is in the making, giving Gnosis a modern look
and intuitive and productive user experience. The interface will offer a light version providing
all functionalities needed to get started as well as an advanced interface to get the most out of
the functionalities offered by Gnosis.
• GnosisDB alpha
Storage of data on a blockchain is very expensive. The blockchain should only be used to
verify the accuracy of information. GnosisDB is a generic database layer combining cheap
storage with the advantage of fast document search and retrieval.
2017 Q3:

• Gnosis Hackathon
Gnosis will host a hackathon to support developers building apps on top of Gnosis.
• RealityKeys oracle integration
RealityKeys will be the first external oracle provider integrated into Gnosis. The RealityKeys

5.4 Development Roadmap

27

service provides automated and human-verified data designed to enable a new generation of
automated information services.
• CryptoEconomic experiments
Thanks to a generous grant from the Ethereum foundation, Gnosis will be running a series of
experiments to test the viability of Futarchy.
• Oraclize integration
Oraclize will be the second external oracle provider to be integrated into Gnosis. Oraclize
aims to be the privileged data gateway between blockchain protocols and the world wide web.
Oraclize’s main goal is to provide a way for smart contracts to break free of their constraints
and provide them with the ability to access all the data they need from the web without
compromising their trustless nature.
2017 Q4:

• Gnosis AMA DApp with Twitter integration
The first end user facing application will target the blockchain audience. Gnosis AMA (ask
me anything) DApp allows anyone to ask the market for an estimate: “When will Ethereum
switch to Proof of Stake”, “Will Bitcoin hardfork?”. A Twitter bot integration will make it
possible to participate by tweeting.
• GNOWIZ functionality
Together with the first end user facing application we will enable the WIZ functionality for
paying fees.
• On-chain exchange as price oracle
As part of offering WIZ functionality, a newly designed market maker will be deployed. This
market maker can serve as a universal price oracle for tokens and will enable using WIZ to
pay fees for markets traded in any ERC20 token.
2018 Q1:

• GNODEX alpha
GNODEX will be the decentralized, scalable state channel based exchange to trade predictive
assets. The development already started, however, due to its complexity it is expected that
an MVP will take at least a year of development. Gnosis seeks to combine forces with other
teams to build the basic layers required to offer a decentralized exchange, with Gnosis adding
layers required to offer trading of prediction market outcomes.
• Futarchy DAO alpha
Gnosis will build a tool to create DAOs that only use prediction markets to make decisions.
The concept was popularized under the name Futarchy by our advisor Robin Hanson. Futarchy
DAOs will measure the market reaction of a decision. The DAO will only make decisions if
the market would react friendly to it.
• Gnosis trading interface alpha
The generic Gnosis interface does not meet the requirements for a trading application. For this
reason Gnosis is working on an additional interface dedicated to traders. Gnosis will combine
the best parts of existent trading interfaces from Kraken, Poloniex and other trading platforms
to provide a seamless user experience.
2018 Q2:

• Gnosis desktop standalone client alpha
Gnosis will offer a standalone application based on Electron, which will come with IPFS

Chapter 5. Roadmap

28

and an Ethereum light client integration. It will allow a fully decentralized prediction market
service ensuring that Gnosis prediction markets can be used from anywhere in the world.
• One other Gnosis DApp
It is the core concept of Gnosis to enable third parties to develop prediction market applications
on top of Gnosis. To accelerate platform adoption, the Gnosis team will develop DApps directly
as well. Which application areas we choose to work on will be based on our own business
development research and coordinated with outside teams that decide to build on Gnosis.
2018 Q3:

• Gnosis mobile standalone client alpha
As mobile becomes the dominating platform for application users, Gnosis seeks to have
dedicated applications for Android and iOS. Based on the popular Status.IM client, Gnosis
will provide fully decentralized prediction markets on mobile.
• Gnosis DApp Store
Gnosis will integrate a DApp store into the standalone apps for desktop and mobile to promote
apps.

5.5

Ongoing Research
Thanks to a generous grant from the Ethereum foundation, Gnosis will be running a series of
experiments to test the viability of Futarchy. Over the next two months we will be running at least
three experiments that will test foundational assumptions toward the successful implementation
of Futarchy. The first two experiments will test the ability of actors to manipulate the outcome of
markets when incentive is provided. In the first of these experiments, a market will be created which
is resolved by a smart contract verified to output 5 at a particular time. In the second experiment, the
smart contract will resolve to either 0 or 10 dependent on a random seed. In each of these markets,
an incentive will be provided to manipulators if they are able to push market values away from their
expected outcomes. By providing this reward we simulate market participants who have incentive
(likely by being shareholders in an organization) to misinform a Futarchy market and will be able to
provide quantitative information regarding the viability of such schemes. In the third market, we
will simulate Futarchy more directly with markets determined by Ethereum blockchain difficulty
at a time in the future. Through these experiments and general tools which we plan to create on
Gnosis, we aim to forge a solid platform for DAOs (and other types of organizations) to use Futarchy
to inform and automate their decision making.

6. Token Auction

Platform, or “app” tokens in decentralized networks can be distributed in a variety of ways. In the
Bitcoin and altcoin model these tokens are distributed gradually via a proof of work or proof of stake
mechanism. There are variations within these mechanisms which are primarily dependent on the
supply curve. This curve determines the rate of dispersion of the total coin supply.
Over the last two years, an informal standard for the token purchase mechanism has emerged. In
this mechanism, cryptocurrency is sent to an address in exchange for some amount of app tokens.
These launches typically run for approximately a thirty day period. The rate of conversion between
the sent cryptocurrency and the received app tokens decreases over this thirty day period (i.e. fewer
tokens per unit of cryptocurrency). For example, the rate during the first two weeks may remain at 1
ETH for 200 Tokens and then decrease linearly to 1.5 ETH for 200 Tokens and below over the open
period. The amount of tokens created is often wholly dependent on the amount of cryptocurrency
sent in. If the rate is 1 ETH for 200 tokens and 1M ETH is sent, 200M tokens will be created.
This model causes friction for purchasers in that they are compelled to purchase app tokens
earlier than they feel is justified for fear of price increases. The uncertainty in token creation may
also potentially lessen the utility of the app tokens themselves.
Our Innovations

In the Gnosis launch, 10 million Gnosis tokens (GNO) will be created and a percentage of them will
be distributed through the token launch. The launch period will end when either of the following
ending criterion is met: approximately $12.5M USD denominated in ETH worth of GNO is sold, or
9 million GNO tokens are sold.
During the launch, participants will be able to send Ether to a token launch address, committing
to buy GNO at or below the current price at the time of their purchase. The price of GNO will be
determined by a falling, as compared to the current trend of rising, price specification. The price of
GNO will decrease every block that elapses during the launch. The price per GNO sold in the final
block, when either ending criterion is satisfied, is the price that will be applied to all preceding sales
during the launch period. Therefore, token launch participants are committing to a maximum price
per Gnosis token and will receive tokens at this rate or lower.

30

Chapter 6. Token Auction

Example user experience

For example, Gnosis creates 10M tokens and begins the token launch. Alice sends 1 ETH to the
token launch address while the rate is at 1 GNO for 1 ETH. The token launch process continues,
with the price per GNO lowering each block. approximately $12.5M USD denominated in ETH
worth of GNO is sold on the 7th day of the launch. On the ending block, tokens were sold at a rate
of 1 GNO for 0.5 ETH. The token launch concludes, and every participant gets tokens equal to the
amount of Ether that they sent, at the rate of 1 GNO for 0.5 ETH (the price when the ending criterion
triggered). Alice, who contributed 1 ETH on day one, would therefore receive 2 GNO, applying
the final sale price to her 1 ETH purchase. Again, participants declare the maximum price they are
willing to pay for GNO, but ultimately receive the lowest price that any purchaser pays for GNO as
the final sale price is applied to all purchasers.
Participation

Economic theory dictates that purchasers should participate only when GNO tokens reach a price
they feel is representative of their utility in the Gnosis ecosystem. Tokens will sell for a very high
price on the initial blocks, representing high demand for the product. If a buyer believes the price is
fair, economic theory would encourage participation. If not, economic theory dictates buyers should
wait until GNO reaches a price they feel is warranted by GNO’s functionality in the platform. It is
important to emphasize that our token launch model is significantly different from previous models.
Participating early provides no special benefits.
Origin of this mechanism

Alex van de Sande, seeking out a model that better enabled participation and eliminated some of the
aforementioned friction created by existing mechanisms, originally proposed this auction mechanism.
We agreed with his suggestion and following the initial idea, we worked with Alex and Vitalik
Buterin, who also supported this design, to create the mechanism that we have now settled on.
Code

Stefan George, technical co-founder of Gnosis has released our smart contract source code along
with the code for our token launch mechanisms. Additionally, his multisig wallet, recently used by
Golem, is also available for review.

8. Legal Considerations

Due to our aspirations for what Gnosis may one day become, the Gnosis team exercised extreme
legal diligence in the lead-up to our launch. This diligence includes significant expenditures on
several law firms around the globe to evaluate the implications of our structure, token launch, and
operations. In the United States, we’ve worked closely with Perkins Coie. In our home jurisdiction
of Gibraltar, we’ve worked closely with Isolas. Due to the retrospective nature of regulatory action,
the Gnosis team can make no guarantees regarding the legality of the platform or launch in any given
jurisdiction. Regardless, we are confident in, and proud of, the work we’ve done to shape Gnosis
into what we hope is a model of regulatory compliance for decentralized applications and token
launches. We will be responsive and collaborative with any regulators as necessary going forward.

8.1

Legal Implications of Token Launches
GNO tokens are functional utility tokens within the Gnosis platform. GNO tokens are not securities.
GNO tokens are non-refundable. GNO tokens are not for speculative investment. No promises
of future performance or value are or will be made with respect to GNO, including no promise
of inherent value, no promise of continuing payments, and no guarantee that GNO will hold any
particular value. GNO tokens are not participation in the Company and GNO tokens hold no rights
in said company. GNO tokens are sold as a functional good and all proceeds received by Company
may be spent freely by Company absent any conditions. GNO tokens are intended for experts in
dealing with cryptographic tokens and blockchain-based software systems.

8.2

Legal Landscape for Prediction Markets
As discussed herein, prediction markets are an area of interest for many regulators around the globe,
including those within the United States. Though we feel decentralization holds great promise, we
must, and intend to, operate our business in accordance with the laws of relevant jurisdictions. As
such, Gnosis may not be immediately available in certain jurisdictions. The Gnosis team and our
advisors are aggressively pursuing strategies to bring the benefits of Gnosis and the information

38

Chapter 8. Legal Considerations

sharing economy to the globe as quickly as possible. First steps may include obtaining financial or
gaming licenses as required by law.

9. Gnosis Architecture

Gnosis is still under heavy development and will be for a while. Parts in this section are subject to
change.

9.1

Systems Architecture
Gnosis aims to be a fully decentralized, serverless prediction market application framework. Gnosis
achieves this goal by utilizing existing technologies like Ethereum and IPFS advancing their features
with new solutions like state-channels for scalable applications.

9.1.1

Core Components
The Gnosis core components consist mainly of four technologies, which are combined in a easy-touse javascript library gnosis.js. Used technologies include:
1. Ethereum allows to run decentralized code with smart contracts, making transfer and settlement of assets simple and censorship resistant. Gnosis is using Ethereum for creation of
events and markets. Every prediction market trade and every settlement is ultimately done on
this layer.
2. IPFS allows to store static files in a distributed file system. It is using distributed hash tables
to distribute files. Gnosis is using IPFS to store all static files gnosis.js or any UI element. In
addition meta information of events is stored in IPFS.
3. GnosisDB tries to compensate the shortcomings of Ethereum and IPFS, which come without
search capabilities. GnosisDB offers a distributed, scalable search combining on-chain with
off-chain data and will be used to query event descriptions of prediction markets.
4. GNODEX is a decentralized exchange to trade predictive assets (prediction market outcome
tokens) using state channels. State channels allow to scaleout transaction capacity of Ethereum,
which is needed to make Gnosis prediction markets accessible to a large scale of users.

40

Chapter 9. Gnosis Architecture

Figure 9.1: Gnosis architecture

9.2

Contract Architecture
The Gnosis smart contract design follows a very modular contract structure making it easy to split
functionalities to upgrade or reuse parts. The current Gnosis implementation consists of over 25
smart contracts ranging from market makers to different oracle solutions. All of them have been
written in Solidity.
For every prediction market two objects have to be created: An event object referencing a real
world event and a market object, which connects the market maker with the event. Once the event
occurred, the event can be resolved and winnings can be redeemed.

9.2.1

Event Factory
The event factory contract allows to create new event contracts, which can be used to resolve markets.
Every event contract has the following (main) properties:
1. Oracle
2. Outcome tokens
3. Collateral token
Oracle

The event references an oracle contract, which will resolve the event. Gnosis is agnostic towards
oracles and allows to use any contract as oracle, which is implementing the oracle interface.
Outcome Tokens

Events can resolve to a number in a range (ranged event) or an outcome out of a list of outcomes. An
example for a ranged event is the Apple stock price on date X. An example for a non-ranged event
would be the winner of the World Cup on date X, which has a list of teams as outcomes. For every
outcome, an ERC20 compatible outcome token is created. Ranged events are represented with two
outcome tokens for long and short positions. Non-ranged events have an outcome token for every
defined outcome. Every outcome has a probability between 0% and 100%. All outcomes together

9.2 Contract Architecture

41

Figure 9.2: Contract architecture
add up to the probability of 100%. After an event is resolved the outcome is known. The winning
outcome has now the probability of 100%. All other losing outcomes have the probability of 0%.
Collateral Token

The ERC20 compatible collateral token defines the currency in which the event is traded. It is
possible to generate and redeem a full set of outcome tokens for 1 collateral token, because all
outcomes together always have the same probability of 100%.
Assuming there is an event with two outcomes and a user invests 10 collateral tokens he will
receive 10 outcome tokens for every outcome. The user decides to bet on outcome 1 and sells all
outcome tokens for outcome 2. The price he can ask for outcome 2 tokens, depends on the market’s
estimate on outcome 2 will be the winning outcome. Assuming the market believes that outcome 2
will happen with 70% probability, 10 outcome 2 tokens can be sold for 7 collateral tokens. Hence
the user invested 10 - 7 = 3 collateral tokens for 10 outcome 1 tokens. When the event occurred and
outcome 1 was the winning outcome, the 10 outcome 1 tokens can be redeemed for 10 collateral
tokens and the user earned a profit of 7 collateral tokens.
Common collateral tokens will be ether tokens or stable coins, which allow to trade without
additional currency fluctuation risk.
Outcome Tokens as Collateral Token - Conditional Markets

Outcome tokens are ERC20 compatible and can be used as collateral tokens for other events.
The interesting feature of outcome tokens is, that they only have a value when the outcome they
represent occurred. Trading an event using an outcome token as collateral implies that the event is
only relevant under the assumption that the outcome occurred. This allows to create events with
conditional probabilities.
Assuming we want to predict, how the potential change of the Microsoft CEO affects the
Microsoft stock price, we create two events:
1. Will Steve Ballmer be CEO of Microsoft end of 2014?

42

Chapter 9. Gnosis Architecture

Outcomes: Yes, No
2. What is Microsoft stock price end of 2014?
Outcome: Any number
The first event can use Ether as collateral token but for the second market, we use the No outcome
token representing the outcome “Steve Ballmer is not CEO of Microsoft end of 2014”. Any market
using the second event is predicting the stock price of Microsoft end 2014 under the assumption that
Steve Ballmer is no longer CEO end 2017.
9.2.2

Market Factory
The market factory allows to create new market contracts, which allow to trade outcome tokens on
markets with a market maker. Every market contract has the following (main) properties:
1. Event
2. Market maker
3. Market fee
Event

A market is always associated to an event and has to be funded in the event’s denomination. The
market maker buys and sells event outcome tokens via the event contract.
Market Maker

A market maker contract like the LMSR market maker allows trading of outcome tokens. The LMSR
calculates prices for event outcome tokens based on demand using a logarithmic market scoring
rule. The higher the demand the higher the price for the outcome token is. Assuming an event was
resolved the demand for the winning outcome token will be so high that the price converges towards
1.
Market Fee

If a market maker is created the creator can define an optional fee - essentially a spread between bid
and ask. This collected fee can compensate the market creator for the the initial funding he spent on
the market maker to give the initial liquidity.

9.3

Oracle Architecture
While all other parts of a prediction market can be automatically executed by smart contracts on
the blockchain, the somehow need to get the information about what happened in the real world
to decide which outcome tokens have to be paid out. The Gnosis platform is oracle agnostic. Any
contract can serve as an oracle so any oracle solution that will be development on Ethereum might
be used by Gnosis. However, we do not only rely on external oracles, we developed a few our self.
Different applications will have different oracle needs regarding resolution speed, decentralization or
trust needs and costs. We anticipate 4 categories of oracles:
1. On chain oracles
2. Centralized oracles
3. Decentralized oracles
4. Hybrid oracles (centralized first + dec. as a backstop)

9.3 Oracle Architecture
9.3.1

43

On-chain Oracles
We can directly provide an oracle about on-chain information. All that is needed is a simple interface
contract that makes sure that the data is available in the right format. A few examples for this kind of
data:
1. What will the difficulty be at block x?
2. What will be the price of a specific token on a decentralized exchange in one month?
3. Futarchy - will a DAO accept a specific proposal?
While the number of those use cases is limited today it will only grow. We can see Gnosis
markets complementing almost every DApp project on Ethereum.

9.3.2

Centralized Oracle
For some applications it will just be fine to rely on a single data provider. In some cases there is just
a single source of truth - e.g. a sensor measurement by a specific sensor, or game results from the
NFL. If those data are available in a structured format only a signature of the issuer is necessary to
make them smart contract compatible. We know that more and more institutions are looking into
making their data smart contract compatible. However - in the meantime a trusted data signer might
as well be for some applications the best solution. It is important to note that the signer (oracle) does
not need to know about the prediction market or even Ethereum. Once the right outcome is signed
anyone can submit this data to the blockchain and the smart contract will evaluate the signature.
Centralised oracle providers that we have already integrated or are planning to include https:
//www.realitykeys.com/, http://www.oraclize.it/ and https://smartcontract.com/.

9.3.3

Decentralized Oracle
Many proposal have been made for how to implement decentralized oracles. The common scheme is
that the truth is a schelling point. Different decentralized oracle mechanisms usually set up various
coordination games where participants are voting in an economically incentivised way. If they vote
along with the majority they gain some value, if they vote against the majority they lose value.
Projects implementing those schemes include Augur, Aeternity, Reality Token. All of these projects
could (maybe slightly modified) be used on Gnosis. We tried to use the essence of those concepts
and came up with a solution that does not have any operating costs. In contrast the Augur concept
expects individuals to actively and regularly report on the outcome of events. Gnosis in contrast
will use a concept called the “Ultimate Oracle” with the big advantage of not having any operation
costs.
In the concept anyone can make a claim that a specific event had a specific outcome by putting
money on the line. This claim can be disputed by anyone by putting more money on the line on
an alternative outcome. The Ultimate Oracle will decide on an outcome if it continues to be the
frontrunner (outcome with most money behind it) for a specific period of time (e.g. 24h). In this case
all money that is put on losing outcomes will be distributed to those putting money on the winning
outcome. To avoid that people will put money on the winning outcome shortly before it is confirmed
the amount is capped at a proportion of the amount of money on the other outcomes. A concrete implementation can be found here: https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnosis-contracts/blob/
master/contracts/solidity/Oracles/UltimateOracle.sol. A discussion about the game
theoretical reasoning behind this concept can be found here.

Chapter 9. Gnosis Architecture

44

Figure 9.3: The "Ultimate Oracle"

9.3.4

Hybrid Oracles
In practice mainly combinations of those models will be used. For cost and resolution time reasons
a centralized oracle will be used first. The oracle will publish a result as fast as possible (could
be within seconds after an event occurs). This will trigger a dispute period. The length of the
dispute period could be determined by the latest trading prices of the prediction market. If the
suggested outcome traded close to 1 the market already agreed on this outcome and the dispute
period can be very short. During this period anyone can trigger a dispute at some costs and give
the responsibility for the outcome to a more decentralized or more secure oracle - e.g. a 3 out of
5 oracle. If the outcome of this oracle will still be disputed a fully decentralized oracle like the
“Ultimate Oracle” can be used as a mechanism of last resort. This approach combines the low
cost, high speed advantages of centralized oracles without compromising with the security that
comes from a fully decentralized oracle which is used as a backstop. Find a implementation of
this hybrid model here: https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnosis-contracts/tree/master/
contracts/solidity/Oracles.

9.3.5

Oracle Standard for Event Descriptions
It does not make sense to store the full plain text event description on the blockchain. For this
reasons we have in coordination with other oracle providers defined a standard format to store event
information in a JSON file together with a deterministic process to generate an unique identifier for
such an event description.

9.4 gnosis.js

45

Figure 9.4: Hybrid Oracles

9.4

gnosis.js
gnosis.js is a free, easy-to-use javascript library, which can be used by anyone to create applications
on top of Gnosis. gnosis.js combines the interfaces exposed by all four core components adding
wrapping functions to allow for easy trading and creation of events, markets and oracles. An alpha
version can be found here.
gnosis.js is used by the Gnosis administration tool offering a standard generic interface to
manage prediction markets. An alpha version of the admin interface can be found here: https:
//admin.gnosis.pm/

9.5
9.5.1

GNODEX
State Channels
State channels allow transactions to occur without requiring them to be sent to the blockchain
immediately. Transactions are exchanged in the form of signed messages which guarantee the
transaction’s future execution on the blockchain. The speed for such transactions is not limited by
the block time, but by the speed of the channel used to exchange the signed messages. Additionally,
the number of transactions are not limited by the block size or gas limit of the blockchain, but by the
bandwidth of the exchange channel. In short, state channels allow an almost unlimited number of
transactions with almost instant finality.
The difference between regular blockchain transactions and state channels is similar to the
difference between a regular bank transaction and a bank check. Instead of sending a transaction
via a bank and waiting for their confirmation, one can sign a check independently and exchange
it with someone else. However, unlike the bank check, which might be not covered, state-channel
transactions are cryptographically signed and can be verified by anyone.

9.5.2

Off-chain Order Books
The use of state channels is crucial to the development of an order book for a decentralized exchange,
as the speed and volume of transactions in an exchange factors critically into its usability and cost
effectiveness. An off-chain order book that operates with minimal trust and can be audited or

46

Chapter 9. Gnosis Architecture

disputed by anyone through submitting cryptographically signed orders to the blockchain, if the
order book misbehaves, is the goal of our implementation.
The Open Order Problem

Although cryptography renders the orders themselves tamperproof, it does not resolve a form of
market manipulation here on referred to as the open order problem. Market makers stand to lose
on markets if enough winning shares are bought from them, so they are incentivized not to include
unfavorable orders come settlement. Similarly, market participants may manipulate the market
by taking advantage of better network access to front run regular participants, degrading the user
experience for those traders without the resources to conduct high frequency trading.
To solve the open order problem, we use blinded batch auctions. Traders submit their orders
encrypted with a public encryption key, the orders are aggregated by the exchange, and a corresponding private key is published after the batch is resolved. The provider of the key pair will be a group
of independent servers running a distributed key generation protocol. That way, nobody is able
to manipulate the market as indicated unless they somehow corrupt the distributed key generation
service past a threshold of servers.
It should be noted that although orders may be blinded by the use of hash submissions followed
by the submission of the order after the batch period ends, that gives market participants the option
of failing to submit the order if it turns out to be unfavorable to them. This is why we have opted for
full encryption in this case.

9.6

GnosisDB
Ethereum promises censorship resistant, decentralized applications. However, as of today some parts
of a DApp stack are still served from some central services, which are controlled by a third party and
can be censored. One of those services is document search. Searching in a larger amount of data
is hardware intensive task, which benefits from centralized execution and thus is most efficiently
done by a remote service indexing data. In the case of Gnosis thousands of event descriptions for
prediction markets have to be served to DApps. We present an approach using smart contracts to
verify search results by using a smart contract as a judge to decide on censorship of results and
punishing bad behavior.
Ethereum allows to run decentralized applications, saving their state on the blockchain. However,
changing the state of applications and storing data is very costly. According to the yellow paper, the
fee is 20k gas to store a 256 bit word. Storing 1KB of data costs 0.0128 ETH (0.18 USD; 1ETH =
14.5USD): 20k ∗ (1024/32) ∗ 20 GWei = 0.0128 ether.
Besides limited storage capabilities, searching for data on the blockchain is very difficult as well.
As of today, the only way to query the blockchain via JSON RPC is executing a call to a predefined
contract function. Searching across different contracts is very limited as the same access controls
apply as for regular transactions.
IPFS and Swarm on the other hand are protocols designed to create a permanent and decentralized
method of storing and sharing files. Storing is very cheap but both protocols come without search
capabilities.
Our approach allows everyone to add records to a public database, making all records searchable
from any DApp. Search results can be verified and censorship can be detected, resulting in a
punishment of the search provider.

9.6 GnosisDB
9.6.1

47

Indexing Data
To allow a decentralized search, all indexed data should be available to everyone, so anyone is able
to start an indexing service based on the same data source. As the indexed data is too large to be
saved on the blockchain, alternative storage solutions like IPFS have to be used. Everyone can easily
add files to IPFS but the hash used to retrieve the data from IPFS is only known to the user adding
the file. To allow everyone discovering files included in the index, the IPFS hash of every file added
to the index should be saved on the blockchain as a reference.
This can be done by adding the IPFS hash to a merkle tree maintained in a smart contract.
By doing so, additional information available at transaction execution time, like the sender and
timestamp can be included in the root hash:
bytes32 rootHash = sha256(rootHash, documentHash, now, msg.sender);
By adding the IPFS hash to the hash chain, we can show anytime later, that an IPFS document
has been part of index at the time it was added. A merkle tree allows to prove membership but not
non-membership. An indexing service could provide search results containing documents, which are
not part of the merkle tree and it would be impossible to show that they are not part of the tree. A
simple approach to prove non-membership is by adding every IPFS hash to a Solidity mapping:
mapping (bytes32 => uint) documents;
The mapping maps IPFS hashes to the block number at the time the document was added. Proof
of non-membership is now very simple: Any IPFS object, which is not referenced in this mapping,
was never added to the index.
To inform indexing services about new documents, an Ethereum event should be triggered when
a new record is added. Every indexing service can listen to the blockchain for events and retrieve the
referenced files from IPFS to add them to their index. A newly started indexing service can iterate
over all events to load all IPFS objects and restore the entire index.

9.6.2

Query Data
One option to guarantee that a searchresult was not manipulated is indexing all data locally and
perform the query against the local index. This won’t be a feasible option for most DApps as search
indexes can become very large. Another approach to ensure that results are not manipulated is to
make manipulation very costly. Everyone, who offers an indexing service, should put up a security
deposit. The indexing service will lose the deposit if manipulation can be detected. To detect
manipulation search results should be shared between clients receiving search results and other
indexing services, which can validate results.
Discover Indexing Service

Before any query can be answered, a connection has to be established between the DApp and the
indexing service.
The DApp has to perform a handshake with the indexing service:
1. A DApp sends out a whisper message asking for indexing services.
2. The indexing service responds with signed connection information (protocol, host, port).
3. The DApp waits for the first response and validates, that the indexing service address derived
from the signature has put up a security deposit. Two indicators can be used to determine the
selected indexing service:
(a) How big is the security deposit. The larger the deposit, the more expensive is manipulation.

48

(b) The faster a whisper response arrives, the faster future queries will be responded, as the
indexer is most likely closer to the DApp user. This is important, if the communication
is solely done via whisper.
4. A direct IP connection can be established with the given information. In case the indexer or
the DApp user don’t want to reveal their IP or have restricted access, queries can be send via a
1:1 whisper connection.
Sending Query

To make sure a result cannot be censored a query object has to define all conditions a document has
to meet. This can include keywords, which should appear in a document as well as an indication,
which documents should be included(e.g. all documents added up to block 300,000).
The query object sent by the user includes:
1. Query string Defines required document properties and sorting. The query could be defined in
a SQL like query language: Contains(title, "Gnosis") LIMIT 10; Block number
2. All documents added until this block number should be included in the search process.
The indexing service processes the query and returns a result object:
1. Result
A list of IPFS hashes, sorted by their ranking.
2. Indexing service signature
Indexing service sings its result together with the user defined query string and defined block
number.
The DApp receives the result object and validates the indexing service signature. To validate
the result the DApp can forward the result to a validation service. Validation can be done by any
other indexing service. The validator runs the query and validates that its result is equal to the result
received by the DApp. If the result should differ, the validation service can challenge the result via
the judge smart contract. The validation service has to prove that there is one document, which
matches the query and has a higher ranking score than a document included in the result with a
higher ranking. If this can be proven, the indexing service delivering the wrong result loses its
security deposit, which could be credited to the validator.
There are three ways an indexing service can manipulate results:
1. Indexing service includes documents, which are not part of the index.
2. Indexing service excludes documents, which are part of the index.
3. Ranking score of objects is manipulated and they are returned in false order.
To prove manipulation the judge contract has to receive the following information for validation:
1. Query string
2. Block number
3. Result documents
4. Challenged document
5. Challenge document
6. Indexing service signature
The Judge contract validates:
1. Is indexing service signature is valid?
If the address derived from the signature doesn’t match the address of the security deposit
holder, the validation process is stopped.

9.6 GnosisDB

2. Is challenged document part of result documents?
The challenged document has to be part of the result documents returned by the indexing
service. The validation process stops otherwise.
3. Is challenged document not part of index up to the defined block number?
Using the document mapping, the validator can easily prove that the challenged document
was not part of the index at the defined block number. The indexing service would lose its
security deposit in this case.
4. Is challenge document part of index up to the defined block number.
The challenge document provided by the validator has to be part of the index at the time of the
block defined in the query. If this is not the case, the validation process stops.
5. Has challenge document higher ranking score than challenged document but has lower
ranking position in result or is not included in result at all.
To prove manipulated ranking positions, the ranking algorithm itself has to be validated in the
smart contract. The ranking scores for the challenge and challenged document are calculated
and compared. If the challenged document has a higher ranking but a lower ranking score than
the challenge document, the result was manipulated and the indexing service loses its deposit.
Exclude Data

IPFS has no guarantee for data being available. Unintentional loss of data or intentional not
publishing of IPFS data can occur. A possible attack would be to add an IPFS document hash to
the smart contract maintaining the index merkle tree but never publish the document. The attacker
could reveal the missing document in the validation process later on and show that this document
should have been included in the search result. Because it is impossible to detect this in a smart
contract, the validator would challenge the result successfully and receive the indexing service’s
security deposit. For this reason, an indexing service should be able to exclude missing documents
from its results explicitly. A hash of all missing docs should be included in the signed result. If an
indexing service is excluding available documents, it won’t be punished but a validator can respond
to the DApp that it owns one of the documents excluded by the indexing service. If the DApp detects
multiple cases of falsely declared missing docs, the DApp should consider switching the indexing
service. In addition, if a DApp receives results containing IPFS hashes of objects, which are missing
and cannot be loaded, the DApp should consider switching the indexing service as well.

Overview of the Golem Project
Grand vision and core features
●

Golem is the first truly ​decentralized supercomputer, creating a global market for
computing power. Combined with flexible tools to aid developers in securely
distributing and monetizing their software, Golem altogether changes the way
compute tasks are organized and executed. By powering decentralized microservices
and asynchronous task execution, Golem is set to become a key building block for
future Internet service providers and software development. And, by substantially
lowering the price of computations, complex applications such as CGI rendering,
scientific calculation, and machine learning become more accessible to everyone.

●

Golem connects computers in a peer-to-peer network, enabling both application
owners and individual users ("requestors") to rent resources of other users’
("providers") machines. These resources can be used to complete tasks requiring any
amount of computation time and capacity. Today, such resources are supplied by
centralized cloud providers which, are constrained by closed networks, proprietary
payment systems, and hard-coded provisioning operations. Also core to Golem’s
built-in feature set is a dedicated Ethereum-based transaction system, which enables
direct payments between requestors, providers, and software developers.

●

The function of Golem as the backbone of a decentralized market for computing power
can be considered both Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), as well as
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). However, Golem reveals its true potential by adding
dedicated software integrations to the equation. Any interested party is free to create
and deploy software to the Golem network by publishing it to the Application Registry.
Together with the Transaction Framework, developers can also extend and customize
the payment mechanism resulting in unique mechanisms for monetizing software.

Golem as an Ecosystem
Golem's business case boils down to the fact that, due to relatively recent technological
advances, the market for computing resources can be organized according to entirely new
principles. In contrast, the compute market today is dominated by heavyweight players such
as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and IBM, who leverage their market power and assets to ensure
hefty margins, resulting in inefficiently priced compute services. Luckily, the market is not
doomed to function this way forever. With Golem the supply of computing resources is based
on contributions of individual and professional providers, combined with an array of
dedicated software solutions via Golem’s Application Registry – itself operating on a single
and competitive market with nearly ​complete information​ market.
Scaling the compute market enabled by Golem requires onboarding three groups: suppliers of
computing resources ("providers"), task creators ("requestors") who submit their tasks to be
computed by the network, and of course, software developers. These three groups comprise
Golem’s unique, interdependent ecosystem.

Group

Golem features

Incentive to participate

Requestors

Golem offers tools to execute
compute-intensive tasks.

Requestors get access to affordable and
scalable solutions, which combine hardware
and software.

Providers

Golem combines and utilizes
(almost) any kind of existing
computing hardware.

Hardware providers get paid for renting out
their hardware.

Software Developers

Golem is a flexible platform to
deploy and monetize software.

Software developers use Golem as a
distribution channel, associated with access
to hardware.

Supply of Infrastructure
The supply of computing power to the network comes from providers. This could be anyone,
from an individual user renting out idle CPU cycles of a gaming PC, to a large datacenter
contributing their entire capacity. Providers have the incentive to join Golem because they
receive payments from requestors for the completed tasks. Of course, Golem’s user interface
will be easy to use, giving providers a clear way to set prices and decide what fraction of their
own idle resources they are willing to rent out.

Demand for Computing Resources
In order to reward providers for contributing their resources, Golem needs to attract
requestors seeking additional computing resources. The market Golem creates will be highly
competitive due to nearly complete information, and the ease of deploying tasks on any
hardware. This will not only make using Golem simple, which will attract requestors - highly
competitive setup will also increase efficiency of the market, very likely resulting in much
more comprehensive and advantageous pricing compared to the existing cloud computing
platforms.
One important feature is that Golem's marketplace will enable requestors to become
providers: because most of them will need additional resources only occasionally. They will
be able to rent out their own hardware and earn extra fees. In addition, financial aspects are
not going to be the sole incentive to use Golem: one of its key features will be the availability
of diverse software running on the Golem network, accessible from the Application Registry.

Software & Microservices
Although some initial use cases (such as CGI rendering) are going to be developed and
implemented by the Golem team, it is of course essential to engage other software developers
to come up with their own ideas for Golem applications. The number and quality of such
applications is one of the key factors in Golem’s future success. For this reason, the

Application Registry and Transaction Framework are among the most important features of
the entire ecosystem, and will be front and central to the development process. Once
introduced, they will provide developers with flexible and efficient tools to deploy, distribute,
and monetize software running on Golem. This is going to be a perfect solution for
microservices and some of the forthcoming decentralized applications (DApps), but could also
become an interesting way to distribute existing proprietary and open source software.

The first use case: CGI rendering

Golem Alpha release: CGI rendering using Blender
It is public, follow ​the link​ to test Golem.

CGI rendering is the first
and very illustrative case
of real Golem usage. Rather
than using costly
cloud-based services or
waiting ages for one's own
machine to complete the
task, CGI artists can now
rent compute resources
from other users to render
an image quickly. The
payment from a requestor
(in this case, a CGI artist) is
sent directly to providers
who made their resources
available. In addition,
when the artist's machine
is idle, it can itself accept
tasks from other users.

Long term vision: Golem as a building block of Web 3.0
We believe that the future Internet will be a truly decentralized network, enabling users to
securely and directly exchange content, without sharing it with corporations or other
middlemen. Accordingly, Golem will be used not only to compute specific tasks, but also to
bulk-rent machines in order to perform operations within a self-organizing network. Of
course, this will require the simultaneous development of other technologies, many of which
have gained significant traction in recent years.
Better data-sharing technologies are necessary, but taking into account the ongoing
development of IPFS/Filecoin and Swarm, the appropriate solutions seem to be within reach.
Eventually, the Ethereum network will become more scalable, more efficient, and include a
fully functional network of micropayment channels. Once these technologies become
available, it is easy to imagine Golem primarily as a platform for microservices, allowing users
to run both small (e.g. a note-taking app) and large (e.g. a streaming service) applications in a

completely decentralized way. Although ambitious, this vision seems to be the ultimate
argument for Golem’s long-term potential.

Golem Network Token (GNT)
The Golem Network Token ("GNT") account is a core component of Golem and is designed to
ensure flexibility and control over the future evolution of the project. GNT is created during
the crowdfunding period (described in this whitepaper) and, following the first major release
of Golem, GNT will be attributed a variety of functions in the Golem network.
●
●

●

Payments from requestors to providers for resource usage, and remuneration for
software developers is going to be exclusively conducted in GNT.
Once the Application Registry and Transaction Framework are implemented, GNT will
be necessary for other interactions with Golem, such as submitting deposits by
providers and software developers or participation in the process of software
validation and certification (as described in the Application Registry section).
The general conditions for using GNT will be set in the Transaction Framework, but
specific parameters of these interactions will be possible to define within each
software integration.

The supply of GNT will be limited to the pool of tokens created during crowdfunding
period.
Creation of the GNT and initial GNT account functionalities
●

●

●
●
●

The Golem Network Token is a token on Ethereum platform. Its design follows
widely adopted token implementation standards. This makes it easy to manage
using existing solutions including Ethereum Wallet.
Maximum number of tokens created during crowdfunding period:
○ Total:
1 000 000 000 (100%)
○ Crowdfunding participants:
820 000 000 (82%)
○ Golem Team
60 000 000 (6%)
○ Golem Factory GmbH
120 000 000 (12%)
Sending 1 ether to the GNT account will create 1 000 GNT
No token creation, minting or mining after the crowdfunding period.
Tokens will be transferable once the crowdfunding is successfully completed.

and see how to support the Golem Project via crowdfunding.

Application Registry
The Application Registry is an Ethereum smart contract, to which anyone can publish their
own applications that are ready to run on Golem network. The goal of the Application Registry
is to:
●
●
●

Give developers a way to publish their integrations and reach out to users in a
decentralized manner;
Give requestors a place to look for specific tools fitting their needs;
Give providers full control over the code they run because of the security concerns.

Since the Golem network is fully decentralized, we also want the Application Registry to be
driven by the community.
Golem allows requestors to execute the code of an application on someone else's computer.
This code is sandboxed and executed with the minimal required privileges. But software bugs
are everywhere, and once in awhile people defeat sandboxes, manage to execute malicious
code on a host machine, and sometimes even take it over. That’s why we can't rely only on
sandboxing. We could try to automatically evaluate whether or not the code is safe, but this is
literally impossible (​vide halting problem). The process of code review and validation cannot
be fully automated and left to the autonomous network. On the other hand, it is impossible to
assume that no one will ever publish malicious software to run on top of Golem network.
We solve these problems by splitting Application Registry users into three categories:
authors, validators and providers. Authors publish applications, validators review and certify
applications as safe and trustworthy by adding them to their own whitelist. Validators may
also mark applications as malicious by adding them to their own blacklists. Providers are also
given the right to choose whom to trust by selecting validators whose lists are used by the
particular instance of Golem running on their nodes. Apart from that, providers may maintain
their own whitelists or blacklists. This gives each provider a lot of flexibility in deciding
exactly what software to run, and what amount of work to put into software curation. What is
more, this system does not exclude any party, and there is always room for new validators to
emerge.
By default Golem runs using a whitelist of trusted applications. Since an empty whitelist is a
problem for someone just trying Golem out for the first time, we will add a number of verified
entries to the whitelist as a part of the initial distribution. A provider can take advantage of
this mechanism, managing her own whitelist, or simply using whitelists of validators she
trusts.
On the other hand, a provider running a computing farm may wish to rely entirely on
blacklists. This is an option tailored for administrators of dedicated machines, who want to
maximize their profits and who are willing to ride the bleeding-edge. In this scenario, a
blacklist is used to banish any known troublemaking applications. Again, the provider can
maintain her own blacklist, or use the blacklists of validators she trusts.

Transaction Framework
When creating something new and exciting, it’s hard if not impossible to predict all the
opportunities which the new artifact will suddenly make possible. Golem is a generalized
global supercomputer, and as such, it will no doubt find its niche with vastly varied
applications. They might need very diverse remuneration models. We are not able to design a
one-size-fits-all payment system for Golem, nor will we attempt to force one upon application
authors.
When a developer integrates her application with Golem, she has the freedom to decide which
transaction model she implements, as long as it is compliant with Golem's Transaction
Framework. The Transaction Framework will take the form of a set of requirements to follow;
basic requirements may include:
●
●
●
●

Entry in the Application Registry;
Use of open source and/or deterministic environment, such as EVM;
Community approval or rating of transaction model;
Use of GNT for remunerating software and resource providers.

We are building the transaction framework on top of Ethereum. Ethereum gives us expressive
power, which is much-needed when implementing advanced, trustless schemes. This includes
components which are extremely difficult to do well in P2P networks, such as evaluating
reputation.
Example transaction framework components:
●
●
●
●
●

Diverse payout schemes such as ​nanopayments​, ​batching
Off-chain payment channels
Custom receipts
Payment to software developer
Per-unit use of software (per-node, per-hour, etc.)

In the future, this might evolve into community-reviewed template code to be used in the
implementation of custom transaction models.
It is also possible to introduce more sophisticated components into the transaction model
design, to meet specific goals not related to payments. For example:
●

●

Requestor escrow for tasks where a higher level of commitment is required (high
price because of specialized hardware or long running subtasks); the requestor may
create a two-party escrow account and require providers to take part in it.
Provider deposit: the requestor may require to be in control of some amount of
timelocked GNT.

●
●

Requestor deposit: the provider may accept tasks ​only from requestors who are in
control of some amount of timelocked GNT.
Registration of a task as an anchor for a TrueBit-style conflict resolution fallback
mechanism.

Roadmap
In this section we present planned milestones for Golem development. You will find a
nontechnical description of Golem’s architecture ​in this post on our blog, some thoughts
about challenges ahead ​here​ and of course you can examine the code on ​GitHub​.
The successive versions of Golem’s software are split into milestones. This plan should be
considered preliminary, as Golem is using bleeding-edge technologies, and is itself a very
complex project.
Each milestone should be preceded with research, with results described in technical
whitepapers. There are however two very important things to note:
1. At every stage new functionalities are added.
2. The scope of deliverables at every milestone depends on the level of funding raised. In
the description of milestones presented below, these functionalities have been
assigned to four indicative funding scenarios.
3. Functionalities marked with ‘+/++/+++’ will be implemented if the adequate level of
funding​ is reached.
We have codenamed concurrent versions of Golem using descriptions from ​the long list of
D&D’s golems​. The analogs might not be perfect, but these are e-golems after all.

Brass Golem
...these are created to fulfill one goal, set at the time of their creation, and wait with absolute
patience until activated to perform this task.
Brass Golem is where we are at the moment with our proof-of-concept, in alpha testing now.
This current version of Golem is only focused on rendering in Blender and LuxRender, and
although it will be useful to CGI artists, we consider CGI rendering to be a proof of concept
primarily, and also a training ground. Brass Golem should be frozen within 6 months after end
of crowdfunding period and a full battery of tests. Even though we do not expect that Blender
CGI rendering will create enough turnover to justify all the work we have put into the project,
this will be the first decentralised compute market.
List of proposed functionalities:
●

Basic Task Definition Scheme that allows to prepare first task definition;

●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Basic Application Registry - first version of Ethereum-based Application Registry
which allows to save tasks defined with basic task definition scheme;
IPFS integration for coordinating task data and content delivery, e.g. deliver files
needed to compute a task, deliver the results back to the requester;
Docker environment with Golem-provided images for sandboxing the computations;
Local verification: a probabilistic verification system based on the calculation of a
fraction of the task on the requestor’s machine;
Basic UI and CLI;
Basic reputation system;
Implementation of ​Blender​ and ​LuxRender​ tasks.

Clay Golem
There is a chance (...) that a Clay Golem will be possessed by a chaotic evil spirit. If this happens
control is lost and the Golem attacks the closest living creature.
Clay Golem is a big leap from the Brass milestone. Clay milestone introduces the Task API and
the Application Registry, which together are going to make Golem a multi-purpose,
generalized distributed computation solution. Developers now have the means to integrate
with Golem. This advance, however, may come at the cost of compromised stability and
security, so this version should be considered an experiment for early adopters and tech
enthusiasts. Prototype your new ideas and solutions on Clay.
List of proposed functionality:
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Basic Task API: an interface that allows a user to define simple tasks;
Initial ​Transaction Framework Model​ with hard-coded payments schemes;
Redundant verification: a verification scheme based on the comparison of redundant
computation results;
Basic subtask delegation: a mechanism for more fined grained subtasks distribution;
(+) Support for virtual machines as a sandbox for computation;
(+) Set of tutorials for developers explaining how to implement their own tasks for
Golem network;
(++) Example task implementations, eg. example machine learning and scientific tasks.

Stone Golem
Stone Golems do not revoke their creators control like (...) Clay Golems.
Stone Golem will add more security and stability, but also enhance the functionalities
implemented in Clay. An advanced version of the Task API will be introduced. The Application
Registry will be complemented by the Certification Mechanism that will create a
community-driven trust network for applications. Also, the Transaction Framework will
create an environment that will allow Golem to be used in a SaaS model.
List of proposed functionalities:

●
●
●
●
●

●
●
●

Full Task API: an interface that allows users to define tasks;
Application Registry​: where developers publish applications ready to run on Golem;
Transaction Framework that allows a choice of remuneration models for task
templates;
Basic Certification support for Software: A mechanism that allows users to whitelist
and blacklist applications, building a decentralized trust network;
Support for SaaS: the possibility to add support for proprietary software which can be
used in tasks. Payments for task creators should also be implemented in the
application;
(+) SaaS tasks examples - example use cases that shows developers how to create
tasks available in SaaS model;
(++) Golem web client: a web interface for Golem nodes as an alternative to the native
GUI / console interface;
(+++) Provider dashboard - providing stats, graphs and more advance settings
management for providers;

Iron Golem
Iron Golems are made of iron and are among the strongest type of Golem. They never revoke the
control of the wizard that created them.
Iron is a deeply tested Golem that gives more freedom to developers, allowing them to create
applications that use an Internet connection or applications that run outside the sandbox. Of
course, the decision to accept higher-risk applications will still belong to the providers renting
their compute power. Iron Golem should be robust, highly resistant to attacks, stable and
scalable. Iron will also introduce various tools for developers that will make application
creation far easier. Finally, the Golem Standard Library will be implemented.

List of proposed functionality:
●
●
●
●
●

●

External data link: enables Golem to use resources and interface with software outside
of the Golem network;
Host-direct mode: a trusted mode for explicitly whitelisted applications or
invulnerable environments, where Golem runs computation outside the Docker/VM;
Certification support for Environments;
Network Status Dashboard - public website displaying basic stats about Golem
Network;
(+) Additional security mechanism - tasks that uses public data link or host-direct
mode are particularly challenging for security. Additional means may be necessary to
make running those tasks safer for providers (eg. central audit oracles, agreements
contracts or code-execution observers may be implemented);
(++) Golem Developer Toolkit: a set of diagnostic and test tools to make creation
process of applications for Golem even easier;

●
●
●
●
●

(++) Reputation-system: reputation protocol that allows the node to effectively
supervise network behaviour;
(++) Advanced transaction system: a system that automatically tries to match
requestors with providers in a way that is most profitable to all participants;
(+++) devp2p integration - changes in p2p and network protocols using new version
of devp2p;
(+++) MapReduce and topological sorting of tasks: add the next abstraction layer,
allowing users to define more generic tasks that are interdependent;
(+++) Golem Standard Library (Golem STD): language agnostic functionality providing
access to the low level core components required to interact with Golem from within a
programming language. Special attention will be paid to I/O functions exposed to
tasks and subtasks related functionalities. Each supported programming language will
have bindings to Golem STD. These bindings will serve as a means of extending the
default standard library of the language in question (custom extensions provided by
developers of programming languages will also be possible). With Golem STD an
automatic task definition, independent from the operating system, will be possible.
Golem STD will allow users to create Golem applications using different programming
languages, which shall significantly increase the number of potential use cases and
simplify task creation process.

Future integrations
There are numerous Ethereum dapps and future platforms currently under development or in
alpha release. We see great opportunities in this environment, not to mention solutions that
could potentially be used as a part of Golem's ecosystem, either directly or as extensions. The
following systems will be considered for integration and their implementation will be
dependent upon the release of production code and complexity of integration:
●
●
●
●

Payment channel solutions based on P2P routing and transactions, eg. ​Raiden or
multi-party payment channels​;
External decentralized identity services, e.g. ​uPort​;
External solutions for task verification or reputation, eg. ​TrueBit​;
External solutions for storage, eg. FileCoin, Swarm​.

Crowdfunding
The crowdfunding of Golem and the corresponding token creation process are organised
around smart contracts running on Ethereum. Participants willing to support development of
the Golem Project can do so by sending ether to the designated address. By doing so they
create Golem Network Tokens (GNT) at the rate of 1 000 GNT per 1 ETH.
A participant must send ether to the account after the start of the crowdfunding period
(specified as the block number). Crowdfunding ends when the end block is created, or when
the amount of ether sent to the account reaches the maximum.

The crowdfunding address will be announced at the crowdfunding start through the following
channels:
●
●
●
●
●

Project webpage: ​golem.network
Official Twitter: ​twitter.com/golemproject
Official Slack: ​golemproject.slack.com​ (you can join ​here​)
Official Blog: ​blog.golemproject.net
Reddit: ​reddit.com/r/golemproject

Please, double-check the address before sending ETH. For security reasons, we advise to
confirm the address using at least two different sources above.
On the project webpage, you will also find a detailed guide on how to participate in the
crowdfunding using either the Ethereum Wallet or Parity.
Crowdfunding is implemented as a smart contract with a few simple parameters:
●
●
●
●
●

Golem Factory GmbH: controls the contract and the address to which gathered ether
will be sent (implemented as a multisig address);
Percent of pre-allocated tokens is 18% (6% - Golem Team, 12% - Golem Factory
GmbH);
StartBlock, EndBlock: these block numbers indicate the start and the end of the
crowdfunding process;
maxCap: maximum cap for this crowdfunding, denominated in GNT;
GNT creation rate, denominated in ETH.

The crowdfunding contract conforms to a few important rules:
●
●
●
●
●

Before the crowdfunding starts, no ether can be sent to the crowdfunding contract;
After the crowdfunding (either maxCap was reached or the crowdfunding deadline
passed), no ether can be sent to the contract;
During the crowdfunding, participants simply send ether to the crowdfunding contract
which results in GNT creation;
All created tokens are ​locked​ during the crowdfunding;
Only after the crowdfunding period has ended:
○ Any user can initiate the transfer of ether to the specified address of Golem
Factory GmbH;
○ The crowdfunding contract creates an 18% endowment of tokens such that
crowdfunding participants’ tokens constitute 82% of supply, regardless of the
level of funding;
○ The crowdfunding contract finalizes funding which results in an allocation of
founders’ tokens and unlocking the created GNT.

There is no minimum financing specified in the contract code. If minimum financing is not
reached, then after the crowdfunding period, ether is sent back to the participants from the

Golem Factory GmbH account. Because GNT is locked by default, if minimum financing is not
reached then ether return procedure is simple and straightforward.
Crowdfunding process leads to creation of GNT, a backbone token for the Golem Network.
GNT implementation follows widely adopted token implementation standards with two
additional functionalities core to the crowdfunding process and future upgrades, namely,
token creation and token migration:
●

●

Create token - during the crowdfunding process, the crowdfunding contract can issue
new GNT (based on the amount of sent ETH).
○ By default, created GNT is locked (nontransferable). Only when crowdfunding
is finalized are tokens unlocked and participants able to transfer them.
○ The creation function is enabled only during the crowdfunding phase; it does
not allow the creation of tokens after the crowdfunding phase is over (token
supply is constant ever after).
Migrate token - a function which implements GNT migration to another contract.
○ Does nothing by default, but if at some point a GNT upgrade is required, a
separate migration contract can be specified and recommended by Golem
Factory GmbH to be used to transfer tokens to the new contract.
○ Technically speaking, if a GNT upgrade is required, a contract implementing
the ​MigrationAgent interface is created and set by Golem Factory GmbH in the
GNT contract (for security reasons this can be done only once). Following that,
each GNT holder can decide whether to call ​MigrationAgent.migrateTokens to
transfer GNT to the new contract, or not.
○ MigrationAgent can be implemented only after the new token is implemented
and deployed. That’s why only an interface is provided right now.

Migration is to be used if it turns out at some point that token upgrade is needed for whatever
reason (e.g. changes in Ethereum, or changes in Golem’s design). The upgrade will need action
from token holders and cannot be imposed by Golem Factory GmbH.

Budget and levels of funding
The ether raised during crowdfunding will be used by Golem Factory GmbH in accordance
with the roadmap ​presented above​. Crowdfunding code implies that level of project financing
might be anything between minimum financing and the maximum financing (cap). The
roadmap is a full vision to be completed if the cap is reached.
Golem should be considered an R&D project involving bleeding-edge technologies. The
progress we have already made while working on the Brass Golem alpha proves the validity
of our general assumptions presented in this whitepaper, but we are also well aware of the
huge amount of work ahead. The commitment of Golem team with respect to the technologies
presented in this whitepaper is full, but still ultimately depends on the level of success of the
crowdfunding.
In the 'minimum financing' scenario, the ultimate deliverable is a working Iron Golem with
functionality enabling the creation of a decentralized market for computing power, as well as
a rudimentary toolbox for developers to integrate their own software with Golem. In
particular, the minimum financing will be sufficient to introduce a basic version of both the
Application Registry and the Transaction Framework.
In the 'maximum financing' scenario, we are making a commitment to deliver a much more
advanced version of Iron Golem, which is not only gunning for total disruption of the market
for computing power, but also dives head-first into the development of some important
components of Web 3.0. In particular, this level of financing will make it possible to create a
flexible platform to distribute and monetize innovative software solutions, notably dapps and
microservices. Assuming the cap is reached in the crowdfunding, the Golem team commits to
create an array of specific integrations useful to the entire community.

Budget structure for maximum and minimum financing
Golem Team consists solely of employment costs. We assume that with maximum financing
we will be able to finance team of 20 people (most of them developers) for a period of 4 years.
Office and indirect costs includes costs of offices in both Zug and Warszawa, as well as other
indirect, employment-related costs.
Contractors ​covers all third parties we are willing to work with. The number here is high
largely because of security audits (four in case of maximum financing: one for every release).
Legal and accounting services are also included in this category.
Community animation and expansion activities are strictly related to Golem’s expansion
plan. This includes both communication and marketing efforts to get new communities on
board, as well as supporting (financing or co-financing) third party integrations with Golem.
Activities here will be mostly requestor-oriented, to ensure that there are a growing number
of use cases integrated, with users actively using them on the Golem network.
The ​Complementary technologies category covers expenditures on external technologies
Golem is dependent on. This will most likely take the form of financing original efforts to
introduce modifications needed by Golem.
Contingency fund ​is calculated as 10% of the total budget (5% for minimum financing).

Hcash will create an all new platform that links to major
blockchains, allowing value and information to circulate between
the different blockchains, hence redefine the value of blockchain.
Below are some important features of the Hcash platform.

1.1 Hive. Composed of Blockchain and DAG systems

Blockchain-Based

Blockless-Based

Hcash platform is designed to be the side chain for both
block-based and blockless-based blockchains. Hcash will be the
value and information carrier for all blockchains to enable the
exchange of value and information possible for between the
systems.

Address Definition
In order to implement with another important feature which we will
mention later, Hcash is
designed purposely
have both public and
private addresses to be
compatible with Zcash
and Byteball address
systems. In the near
future, it is expected to
directly send and
receive ZEC or GBYTE in the Hcash system. Meanwhile, it is also
possible to achieve the fully encrypted communication based on
Zero Knowledge Proof technology between the Hcash nodes and
clients, as well as a range of other exciting new features.

About Directed Acyclic Graph
Directed acyclic graph is a finite directed graph with no directed
cycles. That is, it consists of finitely many vertices and edges, with
each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that there is
no way to start at any vertex v and follow a consistently-directed
sequence of edges that eventually loops back to v again.

h.cash

The DAG graph is a special but more general directed graph
compares to the directed tree. The following figure shows the
examples of directed trees, DAG graph, and directed graph. In the
Big Data industry, DAG is usually used for Big Data structural level,
such as the execution engine of Hadoop, Storm and Spark.
The following graph shows the operating architecture of Spark:

h.cash

There is a dependent relationship between the RDD objects which
forms a DAG situation. The DAG scheduler will split DAG into
‘Stages’. The rules for splitting are simple: scanning through from
back to front, whenever DAG scheduler encounters a narrow
dependence the current ‘Stage’ will be added in whereas a wide
dependence will be split. After completing the division of the
‘Stage’, DAG scheduler generates the ‘TaskSet’ based on each
‘Stage’

and

submit

the

‘TaskSet’

to

‘TaskScheduler’.

‘TaskScheduler’ is responsible for the specific task scheduling, to

As blockchain technology develop, many new blockchain data
structure are now developed base on DAG, for example IOTA [4].
IOTA’s core data structure, called ‘Tangled’, is trying to resolve
existing issues in the ‘Internet of Things’ industry such as massive
data storage and distributed computing. In addition, it provides a
good solution for the micropayment in the IOT industry.

h.cash

Traditional blockchain such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are using
binary tree data structures such as the Merkel tree:

Hcash attempts to establish a channel between the systems, on
top of two completely different data structures, so that it can be
compatible with the current mainstream blockchain technical
standard

while

allowing

the

new

blockchain

technology

communicate with the current blockchain system. Hcash’s
technical development team consists of technical experts from the
world’s

famous

academic

institution

of

cryptography

and

blockchain industry, as well as the experts in Big Data and Cloud
Computing. All these expert will ensure the Hcash project meet its
original system design goals.

1.2 Hybrid .POW+POS Open-Governance Model
The consensus across digital currency communities has always
been a difficult problem to solve. As we all know, the struggle to
upgrade the Bitcoin has been affecting the development of the
community over the past two to three years. And yet the
over-centralisation by Zcash-like digital currencies has certainly
deterred active participation across the community.

Hcash, has incorporated partially the philosophy of Decred and
Dash, introduces Instant-Open-Governance, which allows all
holders to participate in community decisions through the PoS
mining mechanism, including protocol updates and upgrades.
Hcash is more advanced in the sense that it provides smoother
execution. Once the vote is passed, all decisions will be recorded
in the blockchain and enforced, thus avoiding the consensus
problem induced from miners, mining farms, exchanges and wallet
service providers. The PoW mechanism is set to prevent pre-ICO
investors occupying an excessively large portion of rewards in a
PoS distribution. It also has been proved to be the most effective
security mechanism to protect the blockchain system.

h.cash
9

Although an inevitably large amount of energy will be consumed,
we believe such setting is still worthwhile in comparison to the
security benefits it brings to system. Moreover, it is possible to
have the PoW and PoS mining process combined together to
ensure the security of the system.

First, we start mining in a traditional PoW way where the miners
compete to solve for a cryptographic hard problem. According to
this implementation, the blocks being mined do not contain any
transactions (they are more like templates), so the winning blocks
will only include a header and the miner's reward address. At this
moment, the system will switch to PoS. Based on the information of
this header, a set of random validators is selected to sign the new
block. The higher the number of coins a validator is holding, the
higher the probability of being selected. Once the selected
validator completes the signature of the block, the template
becomes a complete block. If some of the validators are not
available for signing the block, they will be selected to sign the next
block and a new set of validators will be selected until the block
gets the correct number of signatures. The fee will be assigned to
the miner and the validators who participate in the signature of the
block.

h.cash
10

For PoW [6], qualified blocks can be expressed as:
F(Nonce) < Target
‘Nonce’ is a random element, ‘Target’ is the quantization of the
qualified block, and the ‘Target’ of each accounting node is
consistent. In addition, successful operation of PoW also requires
the cooperation with the following two principles:
1.Best chain principle: the longest chain is regarded as the
right chain.
2.The incentive principle: reward income will be given to those
who have found qualified blocks.

Principle 1 is a mandatory rule meaning everyone must obey the
rule. The common goal is to find a consistent ledger, and the
longest chain represents the greatest workload. If there is no such
agreement, everyone will only construct their own chain and no
agreement can be reached. Principle 2 is for the workload of
incentives. Since it occurs a cost for supporting the network, the
only way to encourage people to do so is to provide the incentive
according to the workload.
Participation in the accounting blockchain becomes an investment
behavior.

h.cash
11

The cost, output value, and risk form the game under the
constraints of Principle 1, which drive all nodes in accordance with
the rules for the real structure of the block, and ultimately to
achieve Nash equilibrium.

For PoS [7], the qualifying block can be expressed as:
F(Timestamp) < Target * Balance
The above PoS scheme is currently used by nxt [8] [9] and
Blackcoin [10] to take the PoS mechanism. The simplest version of
the PoS mechanism can easily lead to a wealth of centralization
issues, also has a significant impact on the entire system security.
Compared to PoW, the search space on the left side of the formula
is changed from ‘Nonce’ to ‘Timestamp’, the ‘Nonce’ range is
infinite, while the ‘Timestamp’ is extremely limited. The block time
of a qualifying block must be within the specified range of the
previous block time, blocks that are too early or too advanced will
not be accepted by other nodes.

h.cash
12

The target value on the right side of the formula introduces a
product factor balance. The larger the balance is, the larger the
equation for (Target * Balance) will be this makes it easier for a
block to be found. Because ‘Timestamp’ is limited, PoS Casting
Block success rate is mainly related to Balance (Stake). Hcash's
PoS mechanism will draw on the existing PoS mechanism to
improve the efficiency of PoS under the premise of ensuring the
security of the system, and focus on improving the security of the
digital currency when the PoS mechanism is used.

1.3 Hierarchy. DAO Governance
The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is the ideal
product of the cryptography technological revolution. The source of
the Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC) can be traced
back to the decentralized organization described by Ori Brafman in
"Starfish and Spider" (2007) [11], and "peer production" portrayed
by Yochai Benkler in “Web Fortune” (2006) [12]. But these two
concepts are linked with techniques related to cryptocurrencies,
and Dan Larimer put forward the concept of a DAC, which regards
Bitcoin as a DAC also.

h.cash
13

About DAC
In order to have a clear definition of the DAC, we summarize the
seven necessary features of the DAC:
•

Openness: The design of the DAC system is transparent. Open
transparency is the cornerstone of the entire DAC system. A
black-box operated organization cannot be treated as a DAC.
Nowadays the open source software spirit becomes a typical
example of openness.

•

Decentralization: No centralized individuals or organizations
can control the entire DAC. This feature determines the
self-similarity. The decentralization characteristics of the
system ensures the vitality of the DAC system.

•

Autonomy: Everyone can participate the DAC system. All
participants are either DAC system subsidiary or sub-unit, and
from their own point of view to promote the development of
DAC. The spontaneous behaviour of the participant guarantees
the operation of the DAC.

•

Value: The DAC system must be of value, such as the
international payment network, anonymous transactions, tax
avoidance,

value

storage,

non-freezing,

unregulated

characteristics of the Bitcoin system, which determines the
profitability of the Bitcoin DAC system.

h.cash
14

•

Profitability: DAC participants will receive rewards for DAC
system development, and profitability is determined by the
value of the DAC itself.

•

Self-similarity: Even in the case of only some DAC nodes exist,
the DAC system can still function and develop normally. The
destruction of some unit nodes will not affect the development
of DAC, which is guaranteed by the decentralization property.

•

Democracy: Changes in the core system of the DAC system
require the voting from the overwhelming majority of units to be
completed, and the decentralization and autonomy determine
that the DAC must be a system capable of democratic voting.

Vitalik extends this concept and brings forward a more common
DAO

concept.

Unregulated

crowd

funding

and

service

segregations are components of a DAO, as well as cryptography
technological management and trust-based automation. Both of
which allow the DAO to run, as Stan Larimer said "under the
control of a set of business rules without any human participation."
However, if there is no strict control during the system design
stage. This ideal state of the autonomous organization will also
cause serious consequences [13].

h.cash
15

In June 2016, The DAO, the largest crowdfunding program in the
history, raised more than US$150 million for the distributed
autonomous organizations. Nevertheless, due to the code
loopholes, it was attacked by hackers and lost more than 3.6
million ETH. At that moment, the value of loss exceeded US$60
million. Consequently, the ETH community split, resulting in the
existing ETC and ETH double-stranded coexistence situation.

In the Hcash system, 5% of the coins will be sent to a DAO.
Holders of Hcash determine the use of funds in a real-time
dynamic voting system, for example, developing wallets and other
infrastructure construction, or public promotion and other public
relation activities. A DAO is the driving force behind future
advancement and provides the Hcash community with continual
vitality. At the same time, the code for Hcash DAO will go through
rigorous audits and adds the necessary human intervention at the
initial stage (by a third party for code security audits). This is to
protect DAO in the early stage of fund operation and ensure there
will be no major mistake.

h.cash
16

1.4 Hidden. Zero Knowledge Proof
Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP), also known as zk-SNARK, is the
core technology behind the anonymous characteristics of Zcash.
ZKP allows the prover to convince the verifier that a certain
assertion is correct without providing any useful information.

Taking into account the massive amount of Hcash data interaction,
we use an identification scheme in which its security is based on
the hardness of solving the discrete logarithm problem. The
scheme can be pre-computed to reduce the amount of real-time
calculation and the amount of data required to be transmitted. In
order to generate the key pair, we first select the parameters of the
system: prime p and prime q, where q is the prime factor of p - 1. p
≈ 21024, q> 2160, element g is with order q, where l ≤ g ≤ p - 1.
The system parameters (p, q, g) and the verification function (that
is, the public key of the trusted third-party T) are distributed by T to
verify the signature of the message.
Given a unique identity for each user, user A (with identity IA)
selects the secret key s, 0 ≤ s ≤ q - 1, and calculates v = g-s mod p;
A sends IA and v reliably to T and obtains a certificate from T. We
let CA = (IA, v, ST (IA, v)), where ST(.) is the signature generated
by T.

h.cash
17

The agreement is as follows:
(1) Select the random number r, 1 ≤ r ≤ q - 1, calculate x = gr mod
p, which is a pre-processing step that can be done before B
appears;
(2) A will send (CA, x) to B;
(3) B verifies ST(IA, v) with the public key of T, realizes the identity
IA and public key v of A, and sends a random number e between 1
and 2t - 1 to A, where t is a security parameter;
(4) A verifies 1 ≤ e ≤ 2t - 1, calculates y = (s e + r) mod q, and
sends y to B;
(5) B verifies x = gy ve mod p, if the equation holds, then recognize
the identity of A is legitimate.
The security is based on the parameter t, where t is chosen to be
large enough so that the probability of guessing e correctly 2-t is
small enough. The suggested value for t is 72, the suggested
length for p (that is, |p|) is about 512 bits, and q (that is, |q|) is 140
bits.

h.cash
18

Hcash will be motived from the Zero Knowledge Proof technique
from Zcash. It will not only be used to achieve bi-directional
encryption in the process of asset transfer, but also be deployed to
many other areas demanding transactional privacy. Hcash has
integrated real-time communication function within the client, which
can support multiplatform token transfer via a black address in
order to preserve privacy in daily peer to peer communications,
through the technique of Zero Knowledge Proof. It further realises
multiplatform encrypted communication such as from Hcash client
to the Byteball client.

1.5 Hard. Quantum Resistance
Currently within the blockchain systems represented by Bitcoin,
SHA-256 hash calculations and ECDSA elliptic curve cryptography
serve as the most basic security protection along the Bitcoin
network. However, with the advancement of quantum computer
technology,

especially

within

Shaw's

algorithm

(a

typical

representative of the quantum algorithm), related operations can
be achieved from the index level to the polynomial level in theory.
Problems that are difficult for a classical computer in the
foreseeable future can certainly be solved by practical quantum
computers.

h.cash
19

Post-quantum cryptography, also known as quantum-resistant
cryptography, is able to resist the attacks by quantum computers.
The development of such encryption technology takes a more
traditional path, based on difficult problems in specific mathematics
fields. Through researching and developing algorithms, the
post-quantum secure encryption technology can be applied in the
network, and to provide the highest level of data security.

The application of post-quantum cryptography does not rely on any
quantum theory phenomenon, but its computational security can
defend against any form of quantum attack that is currently known.
In 1997, IBM researchers proposed an encryption scheme called
Learning With Errors (LWE)[14][15], which means to learn with
error. As it takes a long time to find the nearest lattice, it can resist
attacks from the quantum computer.

Ring-LWE-based public key encryption scheme:
Related parameter selection and operation rules
The main parameters of the program are n, p, q.
n: the maximum number of polynomials in the encryption scheme.
In the guarantee of efficiency and security standard, it should be
2k.

h.cash
20

q: a large modulus, which is a positive integer. The value of q is
related to the specific case. The q value should be large enough to
ensure that the security is high, but the greater the value of q, the
more system resources will be consumed and the computation will
be increased as well.
p: a small modulus, usually a small positive integer.
Let R = Z
q［x］ /( xn + 1) ，the two polynomial f and g in the ring are
expressed as follows
f( x) = f0 + f1( x) +… + fn－1xn－1，g( x) = g0 + g1( x) + … + fn－
1xn－1，k ∈ Ｒ，
Define the following operations:
k · f( x) = kf0 + kf1x+ …kfn－1xn－1

Private Key Generation
In this scheme, the encryption public key is h (x), the decryption
private key is f (x) and fp (x). The selection method is as follows:
f( x) ·g( x) = 0 mod q
f( x) ·fq( x) = 1 mod q
h( x) = fq( x) + 1
The public key is ( h( x) ，g( x) ), and the private key is ( f( x) ，fp( x) ).

h.cash
21

Encryption process
In the scheme, the random error polynomial is introduced when
encrypting, e( x)∈ Ψα,
Ψα is a Gaussian distribution with the parameter α, and the
plaintext is converted to the polynomial m( x). The ciphertext is:
c( x) = h( x)·m( x) + g( x) ·e( x)

Decryption process
The received ciphertext is c (x), and the steps for decrypting the
ciphertext using the private key f (x) and fp (x) are as follows:
α( x) = f( x) ·c( x)
= f( x) ·h( x) ·m( x) + f( x) ·g( x)·e( x)
=［f( x) ·fq( x) + f( x) ］·m( x) + f( x) ·g( x) ·e( x) mod q (1)
= f (x) · m (x)
Fp (x) · α (x) = fp (x) · f (x) · m (x) mod p = m (x)

(2)

In the decryption process of steps (1) and (2), there may be a
decryption failure. When the coefficient of step (1) is not in the
interval (- q2, q 2) or Step (2) coefficient is not in the interval (- p2, p
2), there will be decryption failure. But as long as the selection of
the appropriate parameters, the possibility of decryption failure is
still very small. We also can be use the algorithm similar to NTRU
to avoid decryption failure.

h.cash
22

Hcash will develop a Ring-LWE key exchange protocol that
works with OpenSSL to achieve post-quantum secure in
blockchain.

1.6 Handy. Limited Blockchain with Unlimited
Transaction
The DAG technology itself is not based on blocks and therefore is
not subject to block validation time constraints (for example, the
confirmation time for Bitcoin is 10 minutes and for Ethereum is 15
seconds). In its auditing procedure Hcash system is designed to
take into consideration the interaction between DAG-based
blockchain system thus some of the advantages of DAG will be
reflected by Hcash. The confirmation time of the transaction in the
Hcash system is almost instantaneous. As DAG is not based on
block, there is no so-called block size limit. In theory, the amount of
transactions that can be accommodated per unit of time is very
large (HTPS, Hyper Transaction Per Second). At the same time,
Hcash needs to consider interaction with block-based blockchain
systems. Therefore it is possible for Hcash to realize a mass
number of transactions per unit time under a limited block volume.
That is the real realization of the "HyperCash" function.

h.cash
23

1.7 Haven. Limited Token Supply
Hcash has a finite supply of tokens. The supply closes to 84
million, and will be separated into six channels:
•

21 million (25%) will be created by PoW;

•

21 million (25%) will be created by PoS;

•

ICO and free distribution will account for 21 million (25%);

•

Pre-ICO investors will hold 12.6 million (15%);

•

4.2 million (5%) will belong to the development team & Hcash
fund,

•

4.2 million (5%) will be allocated to Hcash-DAO.

h.cash
24

Hcash addresses are divided into white and black addresses,
corresponding to the transparent address of Zcash and Whitebyte
of Byteball, and the Z-Add of Zcash and Blackbyte of Byteball,
respectively. Hcash users can convert their white addresses to
black addresses or vice versa within their own wallets, provided
that the total number of Hcash tokens remains the same. In the
system default definition, the 21 million tokens generated by the
PoS stream will all go to the dark address. We call this part of the
currency Hidden coin. Similarly, the 21 million tokens generated by
the PoW stream will also go to the dark address as Hidden coin.
For the remaining 50% of the other Hcash, all will go to the white
address, including the portion from the ICO and free distribution,
early investors, development team and Hcash Foundation holdings
and Hcash-DAO. The token can be changed across the two
opposite side (white to black or black to white) during the
conversion between different systems or transmission between
different users.

h.cash
25

2. Development Roadmap
As Hcash is focused on building new technical standards and
redefining the value, the technical challenges are unprecedented.
The expected development roadmap is shown as below:

h.cash
26

Hcash and Hshare
Since it takes time to implement Hcash code and feature
development, after the end of the ICO all investors will get Hshare
which is based on current mature UTXO blockchain as a token
first. After the Hcash main line is on the line, you can redeem any
Hshare exchange or Hcash official team with Hcash on any on-line
Hshare exchange. And after about 10 months to complete all the
acceptance and replacement. The Hcash team will use technical
means to destroy all Hshare. All Hshare will be permanently
destroyed after the deadline. Hshare's open source code Under
Hcash's GitHub page, everyone can read and review the source
code for Hshare and confirm that the total number of Hsahre
releases is the same as the Hcash number specified in the Hcash
white paper.

h.cash
27

3. Project Risk and Risk Management
3.1 Related risks of Hcash project
Policy risk
At present, although many governments hold a positive attitude
and encouragement policy towards blockchain-related industries,
there are still many uncertainties due to the decentralization
property of public blockchain and the existing centralized
government regulations.

The management team will use the following ways to manage the
policy risk:
•

The team will set up a separate public relation department,
which will actively communicate with the government and
industry practitioners, and to cooperate in the legal framework
for the design of digital asset issuance / trading / financial
blockchain / blockchain applications and related business.

•

The Hcash does not involve currency exchange business. But
the team will not interfere with third-party exchange to carry out
Hcash trading business with existing currency. Hcash team only
focus on technology.

h.cash
28

Market risk
The ultimate goal of Hcash is to achieve the value of the
decentralized free flow in the blockchain system. But since the
blockchain industry has just emerged, the future of the project will
face a variety of market tests.
The operation team will use the following ways to manage the
market risk:
The Hcash operation team will regularly participate in industry
meetings and regularly or occasionally hold project progress and
conference to communicate with relevant developers regarding the
current market needs and prospects. This can ensure that the
project is able to respond to the community and market voices.

Technical risk
Hcash will establish a cross-platform new technical standard,
which is a very difficult task in terms of technology development.
Therefore, it requires top technical talents and large research
involvement. If the control is not good, it will definitely affect the
progress of the project and even eventually lead to the failure of the
project.

The operation team will use the following ways to manage the
technical risk:
Closely rely on the top domestic and foreign universities and the
blockchain community, and to build blockchain technology
innovation joint laboratories with top universities. The Foundation
will also regularly allocate funds to support the Hcash community
and collaborates with other blockchain communities to ensure that
the project technical risks can be controlled.

Financial risk
Financial risk refers to the significant loss of project fund, such as:
fund stolen, development progress incompletion within the
scheduled time because of personnel and financial problems and
so on.

The operation team will use the following ways to manage the
financial risk:
All large amount of digital currency storage are multi-signature
wallet + cold storage by the Foundation directors. In the 3/5
multi-signature mode, we can effectively reduce the risks of fund
stolen and privately misappropriation.

Open Fund Management Platform to disrupt the investment industry

Tim M. Zagar, Jani Valjavec, Zenel Batagelj, Ervin U. Kovac, Ales Lekse

The crises of our time, it becomes increasingly clear, are the necessary impetus for the revolution
now under way. And once we understand nature's transformative powers, we see that it is our
powerful ally, not a force to feared our subdued. (Thomas Kuhn)

July 2016

WHY INVEST IN ICONOMI?
ICONOMI is about disruption - the “uberisation” of fund management. We are pairing
the business-model fundamentals of the crypto-world and the obvious trend of platform
domination with new technological possibilities.
Internet, Facebook, Android, Uber - those are all the big stories where it was impossible
to invest at the early stages of development. It was either technically not possible (for
example with the Internet) or it was only reserved for “big investors”, who in turn reaped
all the high profits.
We believe that blockchains are game-changers for the investment world, linking those
with disruptive ideas directly to those looking for investing opportunities, no matter the
skill level or size of investment. Now it is possible to invest in disruptive technologies at the
very early stages.
ICONOMI’s mission is to cater to investors looking for high profits, not possible in the old
economy. It will do so through a simple and trustworthy entry point, providing them with
excellent experience, which is crucial for keeping them investing in the new economy. With
your help, ICONOMI will bring an influx of fresh capital into the distributed economy,
providing funding for exciting new projects and boosting the value of digital assets along
the way.
ICONOMI is creating the missing link between the old and the new economy. Speaking
the language of the old economy and acting by the principles of the new one, ICONOMIs
transparent management will be provided by an EU legislation compliant and regulated
service operator.
Our timeline is ambitious - our journey already started in Q1 2016, when we first began
offering Ether and learning what clients are missing. In Q3 2016 we will finalise the required
infrastructure and in Q4 2016 we will introduce the first two ICONOMI investment funds.
2017 will be dedicated to our vision. We will launch the ICONOMI Open Fund
Management platform with a simple promise to successful traders - anyone can be a
professional fund manager; “You bring the crypto-expertise, we take care of everything
else”.

2

ICONOMI will open up a new financial services category in the decentralised economy,
with a guaranteed income stream and an ambitious platform vision. We are positive that
ICONOMI is one of the most appealing business proposals of 2016 with its high probability
of investment multiplication.

CREATION OF NEW FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

ICONOMI will launch the ICONOMI Open Fund Management platform (OFM) and two
types of new financial instruments: the ICONOMI Coin Traded Fund (CTF) and the
ICONOMI Coin Managed Fund (CMF).

1.1

Open Fund Management (OFM) platform

The essence and vision of the ICONOMI project is the ICONOMI Open Fund
Management (OFM) platform for investing. OFM is a simple management tool where
traders with knowledge and experience create their own investment funds. Investors, on
the other hand, are able to invest even the smallest amounts, getting a clear overview of
available investment fund managers and their current & past performance. The ICONOMI
Open Fund Management (OFM) platform will disrupt the asset management industry.
ICONOMI OFM platform’s promise is short: “You manage the funds, we take care of
everything else”
•

We bring the investors - at the time of OFM platform introduction, the ICONOMI
platform will already have a large base of ICONOMI CTF and CMF investors.

•

The OFM platform systematically enables the sharing of management fees between
fund managers and investors with Ethereum smart contract utilisation.

•

The OFM platform will feature numerous easy to use tools, such as the portfolio
management tool, market data analysis tool, market forecast and history and much
more.

1.2

Coin Traded Fund (CTF)

CTFs will be managed automatically based on predetermined rules and will be inherently
transparent. Their behaviour will respond to market developments, making the individual
coin percentages in the funds dependent on preordained rules and changes on the market.
Our analytical services will constantly monitor several market parameters, continuously
analyse available market data, build detailed market forecasts and adapt investment funds
as needed, within preset limits.
Investors will benefit from lower risks, which are going to be mitigated with careful
preselection of included tokens of value, and lower price volatility. Since CTFs will be
continuously tradable, they will be attractive to investors who are looking to buy and sell

units of the fund (tokens) in a matter of seconds. Daily liquidity of CTFs on the market is
going to be guaranteed by market makers, who, by exploiting arbitrage opportunities, will
be pushing the prices of CTFs to their net asset value.

1.3

Coin Managed Fund (CMF)

CMFs will be actively managed by a team of experts - financial analysts, mathematicians
and cryptocurrency community professionals. Veterans of their respective fields, with
decades of experience and successful projects behind them, they will help hone the
ICONOMI spear for attack on the markets, making the ICONOMI CMF funds one of the
most profitable financial instruments. With possibility of return on investment
multiplication, CMF funds will represent our highest risk investment opportunities.

2

ICONOMI INVESTMENT FUNDS

Both CTF and CMF ICONOMI funds offer significant advantages over traditional
investment funds.
•

Each ICONOMI investment fund will issue its own tokens. CTFs will be offered to
all major exchanges, therefore expect them to be found (traded) there. CMFs will
be tradable only within ICONOMI.

•

ICONOMI funds will be hyper-liquid and accessible 24/7 via the ICONOMI debit
card when kept on the ICONOMI platform.

•

ICONOMI investment funds will establish new ground-breaking standards in
transparency - all aspects of fund management will be accessible at all times.

ICONOMI will introduce two investment funds: the CTF type ICONOMI.INDEX FUND
and the CMF type ICONOMI.PERFORMANCE FUND.

2.1

ICONOMI.INDEX FUND

The ICONOMI.INDEX FUND will reflect the development of a credible cryptocurrency
market. As a CTF fund it will be transparently managed and traded on major exchanges.
The ICONOMI.INDEX fund will include several thoroughly-researched cryptocurrencies,
including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Lisk, Steem and other major value tokens.
A carefully chosen package of undervalued assets, stripped of the risks associated with
acquiring and storing the assets yourself, the ICONOMI index fund is perfect for instantly
6

creating a well-balanced portfolio of cryptocurrencies, while still enjoying significantly
higher profits than with any other existing financial instruments.

2.2

ICONOMI.PERFORMANCE FUND

The ICONOMI.PERFORMANCE FUND will aim at high performance - multiplication
of investment. As a CMF it will be actively managed by a team of ICONOMI experts. Our
team will scout for propitious early investment ICO opportunities (crowdfunded startup
projects and companies). Through our company-focused fund, everyone can become a
venture capitalist, without any of the hassle and capital requirements.
In order to ensure the best possible management and prevent the possibility of
oversubscription, the ICONOMI.PERFORMANCE fund will be by invitation only.
ICONOMI ICO participants will be invited to join the ICONOMI.PERFORMANCE fund!

3

ICONOMI PLATFORM DETAILS

The ICONOMI platform envisioned in this white paper is meant to exist autonomously
after development completion. Being a crowdfunded project, a majority of 85 % will be
owned by the crowdfunding participants in the form of ICONOMI tokens (“ICN”), while
a share of 15 % ICNs will be reserved for the original development team, advisors, bounties
and the earliest adopters/contributors. Possessing the required prerequisites, Cashila OOD
s.r.o. will serve as the first ICONOMI service operator. It will do so without participation
in profit-sharing, financing itself only from the capital raised through the crowdfunding
campaign.

3.1

ICONOMI Crowdfunding - Initial Coin Offering

The capital required for development and release of the ICONOMI platform will be secured
through a crowdfunding campaign - ICONOMI Initial Coin Offering (hereinafter referred
to as “ICO”). 10 days after the conclusion of the ICO, ICONOMI will issue 100 million
ICONOMI tokens. ICONOMI tokens will be Ethereum-based tokens of value (see below).
ICO will be open to everyone between 25. 8. 2016 8:00 UTC and 29. 9. 2016 20:00 UTC.
During this time, a special ICONOMI ICO website will be available at ico.iconomi.net
where ICO participants will be able to generate user accounts. ICONOMI ICO website

7

will guide participants thought the deposit process. Several fiat and crypto currencies will
be accepted - for details regarding the deposits please see our FAQ.
10 days after the funding campaign is completed, the number of ICONOMI tokens
belonging to each ICO participant will be determined based on the total amount raised and
the ICONOMI tokens transferred to individual user accounts. Should the crowdfunding
campaign fail to reach its capital goal of 2000 BTC or equivalent, all funds will be returned.

3.2

ICONOMI Tokens (ICN)

ICONOMI will issue 100 milion ICONOMI tokens (ICN) 10 days after the crowdfunding
campaign successfully ends. 100 % of the ICONOMI tokens represent 100 % ownership of
the ICONOMI platform, comprising of all assets and liabilities, as well as each and every
right and obligation, including but not limited to intellectual property rights, branding and
trademarks.
ICN will be an Ethereum-based token of value. Tokens are a digital asset, bearing value
by themselves based on their underlying assets, properties and/or rights. ICN tokens
represent ownership of the ICONOMI platform, allowing their holders to receive dividends
and vote on ICONOMI related issues.
While Bitcoin serves as an excellent example of a successful token of value, Ethereum
enables us to easily create much more complex systems with very little entry costs. Ethereum
based tokens rely on a well-established Ethereum infrastructure, benefiting from several
advantages:
1. security and predictability (as opposed to, for example, having to run an
independent blockchain network);
2. use of robust and well- supported clients (Ethereum- based tokens can be managed
with official Ethereum clients):
3. high liquidity (interchangeable with other Ethereum- based tokens or Ether);
4. easier listing on exchanges with infrastructure already in place;
5. Ethereum smart contracts enable a very transparent and secure way of profitsharing among the token holders.

8

3.3

ICONOMI Technical Details

All non-fiat funds sent during the ICO will be immediately — with the next block after
they are received — sent to a cold-storage, multi-signature address. Ether will be
transferred automatically by a smart contract already developed and tested with the current
iconomi.net platform. Private keyholders will be announced before the ICO starts and will
include several well-known, independent individuals from the crypto community.
In order to gain access to the assets acquired during the ICO, a sufficient time from the
issuance of ICNs will have to pass. What is more, independent multisig signatories will have
to approve the transfer. The ICONOMI team will not hold the number of private keys
required to gain access to the funds.
ICNs will be issued with the deployment of a smart contract on the Ethereum network and
transferred to an Ethereum address users will be able to provide through the ICONOMI
interface. Users who fail to do so will still be able to access their ICNs via the ICONOMI
website.

3.4

ICONOMI Service Operator

The service operator of the ICONOMI platform provides a way of materialising the actions
of the autonomous ICONOMI platform. In the same way that a juridical personality
manifests its actions through its authorised natural persons, the ICONOMI platforms
establishes its relationships with other juridical persons, natural persons and government
entities through the at-the-time elected service operator.
Cashila OOD s.r.o. (hereinafter referred to as “Cashila”) will serve as the first service
operator of the ICONOMI platform. Having at its disposal the required knowledge,
technical skills and manpower, as well as the status of a financial institution and a longstanding relationship with both the crypto and investment communities, Cashila will
undertake to develop and manage the ICONOMI platform in accordance with the vision
outlined in this white paper and detailed in the accompanying documentation on behalf of
the ICN token holders. Cashila does not and will not claim or register any kind of property,
trademark or other rights pertaining to the ICONOMI platform. All intellectual property
rights, trademarks, branding and other rights remain exclusively the property of the
ICONOMI platform.

9

Cashila will develop and organise the ICONOMI ICO campaign on behalf of the
ICONOMI platform. Cashila will develop and manage the ICONOMI platform as the first
service operator. Although a profit-sharing scheme between the ICONOMI platform and
its service operator is intended to be exercised, Cashila will not participate in profit-sharing
at least until such time that the capital raised during the ICONOMI ICO covers the
operational costs of Cashila.
ICN ownership entitles its possessor to participate in ICONOMI platform related voting.
One of the most important voting issues will be the selection of service operators. ICN
holders are free to vote on a service operator at any time after the ICONOMI platform has
been launched, but not before a 24-month moratorium has passed.

1

No central hub to buy/sell/exchange, access market data and
news, or to chat about existing and emerging cryptocurrencies

2

5
6

No dedicated network for enthusiasts and professionals
globally in the blockchain industry

3

Cryptocurrencies, especially newer alt coins, suffer
from lack of exposure, and in turn generate little
value for those who are not actively using a network

4

Content creators recognize how advertising may
diminish their works value to the consumer

Crypto and alt coins information is too fragmented and
scattered. Centralization is needed

Revenue opportunties for active community contributors are
weak

3

3. THE SOLUTION
We have built a smarter social networking and market access platform (Browser and
Mobile) for the cryptocurrency community. This will enable the community to establish
professional relationships, learn, manage their wallets, and exchange ideas.

A smarter social networking and
market access platform for the
cryptocurrency community.

The investFeed platform will:

▪

Ensure every cryptocurrency has its own dedicated feed, market data, and
blockchain history.

▪

Allow users to earn & exchange digital currency, cryptocurrency, and money.

▪

Provide multi-language support to accommodate global consumption.

▪

Encourage users to share and boost content for viral search to bring value to many
passive users. Creators posting to investFeed may monetize merely by having their
work recognized (or “liked”) by the investFeed community.

▪

Create clarity for the rapidly growing dynamic crypto and alt coin space.

▪

Accurately and transparently reward an unbounded number of individuals who
make subjective contributions to the community.

▪

Allow users to establish career profiles on the social network

▪

Empower users to skip credit cards altogether and process FEED Token payments
from smartphone to smartphone.

4. INVESTFEED GOALS
investFeed plans to disrupt the cryptocurrency industry by bringing transparency and
ease of use which are currently lacking. Our main goal is to integrate cryptocurrencies
into the traditional financial world and to create a single gateway to the market that is
open, transparent, and rewards-based for all our users, contributors, and financial
institutions wherever they may be in the world.
We have been in operation since 2014 and have a fully built-out social investing platform
with multiple social networking features. This is not a planned product. It exists today. Our
investFeed Social network app for Android and iOS is available in the respective app
stores. We have experience and a proven track record maintaining a platform that
caters to the needs of our users.
Our existing platform has over 15 thousand member sign-ups with over 200 thousand live
feeds since launch. 78% of our users are experienced traders, 54% are affluent US adults
($100k+) and 52% are self-employed or founders. This user base can be seamlessly
converted to our crypto-offering. Again, these are not forecasted user numbers. They
exist today. Additionally, most crypto-traders invest in traditional financial assets as well
as cryptocurrencies and so there is a natural synergy between our existing and new
offering.
We are building a new financial ecosystem, a new way and we want our community to
be our token holders. As much as we believe in the democratization of digital transacting,
we also believe in putting the power of our community back into the hands of the
community. As such, we are going for an ICO Initial Coin Offering and ask you, the cryptocommunity to be our supporters.

6. INVESTFEED TOKEN
Ethereum enables the creation of ERC20 tokens, which can be used in an incentive
system to replace intermediaries. In investFeed’s system, FEED Tokens will play a key role
in providing economic incentives so that the rational behavior of individuals results in
common good. Unlike in Twitter where volunteers must donate their time to contribute
and validate information, on investFeed’s platform, contributors will be rewarded for their
work and incentivized to continue increasing the value of the community ecosystem.

6.1. The Role of FEED Token
Incentives

Purchases

Boost

•Give and receive
incentives for great
content

•Purchase premium
content from other
members - articles,
videos & other

•Promote aka "Boost"
your content by posting
a sponsored link or
video to attract paying
customers

•Purchase an ad-free
experience across the
platform

12

6.2. FEED Marketplace Capabilities
Every feature in the investFeed platform that gives any added value to its user will require
payment using FEED Tokens. Every user who facilitates the use of a feature which in turn
gives added value, will be entitled to receive FEED Token.
As the network grows, there will be limited token supply versus demand and the value of
the FEED Token will naturally appreciate, establishing a healthy ecosystem and control
mechanism that rewards beneficial content and suppresses the noise.
The below are a list of planned initial use cases for the FEED Token. However, this list is not
exhaustive and as we have done in the past, we will listen and respond to our contributors
and community network, incorporating their views on how to improve and add more
value to the platform and the community.

▪

Members (media outlets, professionals and non-professionals equally) can
contribute premium content and charge in FEED Token for access

▪

Promote your own content and profile for network exposure using FEED Token

▪

Experienced investors and analysts can monetize their knowledge and expertise
by sharing their ideas, articles, videos, and even portfolio performance and trade
activity with their subscribers. The FEED Token fee be will determined by the
content provider and may be set on a time-based subscription level or unlocking
an individual piece of content

▪

Users can follow top traders and analysts and news outlets and receive real time
alerts from those members via in platform notifications, email, SMS, and mobile
push notifications using FEED Tokens

▪

FEED Tokens will be required to access the higher levels of advanced trader tools

▪

FEED Tokens can be used to purchase an ad-free experience from the network

13

6.3. Token Technology
Our tokens will be of a standardized ERC20 form, so they can easily be integrated or
displayable for any other party who wishes to do so. All of this code will be publicly
available in our repositories and can be audited by anyone who wishes to do so.

6.4. FEED Token Transaction Mechanics
Thanks to the Ethereum Blockchain all FEED Token payment transfers are performed in a
decentralized,

autonomous

and

completely

transparent

manner.

Sites

like

https://etherscan.io allow you to see and follow transactions on the Ethereum
blockchain.
We will strive to keep the architectural design and documentation as up to date as
possible, so everyone can quickly grasp the underlying investFeed architecture. Currently
we are developing a plan to improve and expand our specific technology stack and the
full details about the backend solution will be elaborated upon in due course.
The initial marketplace mechanics will be centralized as we require a database where
we can link contracts to premium content and investFeed products like ad-disabling. Our
end goal however, is to fully decentralize the investFeed organization and underlying
database by Q1 2019.

A connection with the Ethereum MainNet will be handled using Parity, which will serve as
our Ethereum node. This will ensure that our connection to the network is always
synchronized, and transactions can be processed and validated quickly and securely. A
React and Web3 stack will be used as our front-end bridge and interface to monitor all
events in real-time and record them in the database.

9.1. About Token Sale
We are launching an open Ether (ETH) capped token sale to raise funds for the investFeed
project to enable us to add more features in the platform. We will be raising minimum
1,500 Ethers and maximum 28,000 Ethers (both inclusive) during the token sale & presale.
The number of tokens issued per Ether will depend on the Ethers raised as per below table.
You can buy FEED Tokens using any amount of Ethers including a fraction of Ethers like
0.0023 ETH. We will be offering a discount to early contributors which will decay with
number of Ethers purchased during the token sale. So, the earlier you purchase, the
better the token price you will receive. You can also join us in the pre-sale by contacting
us directly with a minimum commitment.

FUND ESCROW

ARRANGEMENTS
When the FEED Token sale completes successfully, the FEED Tokens will be enabled for
transfer among the members instantly. Tokens can be pre-purchased through the ICO
site, or earned through a series of bonus / bounty / referral programs or via the investFeed
platform.
The funds become available to investFeed under the milestones described under 'Project
Funds Release'. To promote trust in the investFeed project and to execute a successful
Token sale we have established an escrow arrangement using a Multisig wallet for both
Bitcoin & Ether.
Ether Multisig Wallet: We will be using standard Ethereum Multisig wallet contract created
through the Ethereum/Mist Wallet.
Each withdraw from the fund will require 3 out of 4 below signatories to sign the
withdrawal transaction. Escrow signatories for both the currencies will be:

Toshendra Sharma & Gary Dmitriev will each receive 0.5% of the amount raised at ICO in
ETH but with the minimum of 20 Ethers each. This will be treated in the P&L as part of 'cost
of raising capital' and the escrow fees shall be paid out the day after the ICO has officially
closed.
They shall be calculated as follows:
▪

Total raised during ICO x 1% = total escrow fees (of which 1/2 are paid to
Toshendra & 1/2 to Gary the day following ICO closing).

The remaining balance will constitute the funds the Escrow Signatories will release to the
project as outlined below.

26

10.1.

Project Funds Release

The ICO Balance after escrow fees will be released via Multisig on a 3 of 4 arrangement.
Funds will be released in 3 stages when the following milestones are met:
1. FEED Token post-Token Sale complete: 50% funds released
2. Milestone 1: Application Infrastructure integration complete: 25% funds released
a. investFeed social network application operable, and connected to
underlying market with live price tracking
3. Milestone 2: investFeed application live in beta: 25% funds released
a. investFeed product live in beta, to a designated client’s requirements
Should the circumstance arise where the first milestone has not been met after a period
of 90 days following completion of the ICO, the REMAINING funds raised will be returned
to the purchasers.

10.2.

Project Funds Usage

The proceeds of the funds raised will be used to deliver on our goal of disrupting the
cryptocurrency industry and create a single gateway to the market that is open,
transparent, and rewards-based for all our users and contributors. This will entail additional
human resources within the team to deliver on our development roadmap. Most of the
funds raised will be allocated to this development task.
We also intend to allocate 20-25% of the raise to marketing in order to drive community
awareness and grow our community user base. This budget will go towards the creation
of marketing resources, both in terms of content and ensuring we have the appropriate
human resources to drive our brand via the appropriate channels.
Over and above development and marketing expenditure, investFeed will incur some
administration, legal and other operating expenses which will form part of the usage
budget.

27

11.

OUR PROMISE

We want to grow a community of users that echoes our philosophy. If you believe in an
open, transparent, rewards based alternative to the current status quo, then join us. You
will find yourself among friends. We want to put you, the members of our community,
back in the driving seat. In control of your privacy. In control of your investments. In control
of your earning potential.

Our community is at the heart of
investFeed.
Without you, we are nothing.

DISCLAIMER

NOT AN OFFER TO SOLICIT SECURITIES AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FEED AND THE
INVESTFEED APPLICATION
Last Updated June 21, 2017
This document is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer or
solicitation to sell shares or securities in investFeed, Inc. or any related or associated
company. Any such offer or solicitation would only be made by a confidential offering
memorandum and in accordance with applicable securities and other laws. None of the
information or analyses presented are intended to form the basis for any investment
decision, and no specific recommendations are intended. Accordingly, this document
does not constitute investment advice or counsel or solicitation for investment in any
security. This document does not constitute or form part of, and should not be construed
as, any offer for sale or subscription of, or any invitation to offer to buy or subscribe for,
any securities, nor should it or any part of it form the basis of or be relied on in any
connection with, any contract or commitment whatsoever. InvestFeed expressly
disclaims any and all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage of any
kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from: (i) reliance on any information
contained in this document, (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information
or (iii) any action resulting therefrom.
The investFeed Token, or “FEED”, is a cryptographic token used by the investFeed
application.

FEED is not a cryptocurrency.
At the time of this writing, (i) with the exception of being used to place ads on the
investFeed platform, FEED cannot be exchanged for goods or services, (ii) FEED has no

29

known uses outside the investFeed application, and (iii) FEED cannot be traded on any
known exchanges.

FEED is not an investment.
There is no guarantee – indeed there is no reason to believe – that the FEED you purchase
will increase in value. It may – and probably will at some point – decrease in value. Those
who do not actually use their FEED honestly and fairly may lose their right to use FEED and
may lose their FEED to those that do use FEED honestly and fairly.

FEED is not evidence of ownership or right to control.
Controlling FEED does not grant its controller ownership or equity in investFeed, or the
investFeed application. FEED does not grant any right to participate in the control,
direction or decision making of investFeed or the investFeed application.

30

13.

RISK DISCLOSURES

Risk of Losing Access to FEED Due to Loss of Credentials
The purchaser’s FEED may be associated with an investFeed account until they are
distributed to the purchaser. The investFeed account can only be accessed with login
credentials selected by the purchaser. The loss of these credentials will result in the loss of
FEED. Best practices dictate that purchasers safely store credentials in one or more
backup locations geographically separated from the working location.

Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol
FEED and the investFeed application are based on the Ethereum protocol. As such, any
malfunction, unintended function, unexpected functioning of or attack on the Ethereum
protocol may cause the investFeed application or FEED to malfunction or function in an
unexpected or unintended manner. Ether, the native unit of account of the Ethereum
protocol may itself lose value in ways similar to FEED, and also other ways. More
information about the Ethereum protocol is available at http://www.ethereum.org.

Risks Associated with Purchaser Credentials
Any third party that gains access to or learns of the purchaser’s login credentials or
private keys may be able to dispose of the purchaser’s FEED. To minimize this risk, the
purchaser should guard against unauthorized access to their electronic devices.

Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions
Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies
around the world. The functioning of the investFeed application and FEED could be
impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, including the licensing of or
restrictions on the use, sale, or possession of digital tokens like FEED, which could impede,
limit or end the development of the investFeed application.

31

Risk of Alternative, Unofficial investFeed Application
Following the Crowdsale and the development of the initial version of the FEED platform,
it is possible that alternative applications could be established, which use the same open
source code and protocol underlying the investFeed application. The official investFeed
application may compete with these alternative, unofficial FEED-based applications,
which could potentially negatively impact the investFeed application and FEED,
including its value.

Risk of Insufficient Interest in the investFeed Application or Distributed
Applications
It is possible that the investFeed application will not be used by a large number of
businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public
interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of
interest could negatively impact FEED and the investFeed application.

Risk that the investFeed Application, As Developed, Will Not Meet the
Expectations of investFeed or the Purchaser
The investFeed application is presently under development and may undergo significant
changes before release. Any expectations or assumptions regarding the form and
functionality of the investFeed application or FEED (including participant behavior) held
by investFeed or the purchaser may not be met upon release, for any number of reasons
including mistaken assumptions or analysis, a change in the design and implementation
plans and execution of the investFeed application.

Risk of Theft and Hacking
Hackers or other groups or organizations or countries may attempt to interfere with the
investFeed application or the availability of FEED in any number of ways, including service
attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus based attacks.

32

Risk of Security Weaknesses in the FEED Application Core
Infrastructure Software
The investFeed application consists of open source software that is based on other open
source software. There is a risk that the investFeed team or other third parties may
intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural
elements of the investFeed application interfering with the use of or causing the loss of
FEED.

Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of
Cryptography
Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum
computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the investFeed platform, which
could result in the theft or loss of FEED.

Risk of FEED Mining Attacks
As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens and cryptocurrencies, the blockchain
used for the investFeed application is susceptible to mining attacks, including doublespend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race
condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the investFeed application,
FEED, and expected proper execution and sequencing of Ethereum contract
computations. Despite the efforts of the investFeed team, the risk of known or novel
mining attacks exists.

Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the investFeed Application
While FEED should not be viewed as an investment, it may have value over time. That
value may be limited if the investFeed application lacks use and adoption. If this
becomes the case, there may be few or no markets following the launch of the platform,
potentially having an adverse impact on FEED.

33

Risk of an Illiquid Market for FEED
There very well may never be a secondary market for FEED. There are currently no
exchanges upon which FEED would trade. If ever exchanges do develop, they will likely
be relatively new and subject to poorly understood regulatory oversight. They may,
therefore, be more exposed to fraud and failure than established, regulated exchanges
for other products and have a negative impact on FEED.

Risk of Uninsured Losses
Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, funds held using
the investFeed application or Ethereum network are generally uninsured. In the event of
any loss, there is no public insurer, such as the FDIC, or private insurer, to offer recourse to
the purchaser.

Risk of Dissolution of the investFeed Project
It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including an unfavorable fluctuation in
the value of Ether, development issues with the investFeed application, the failure of
business relationships, or competing intellectual property claims, the investFeed project
may no longer be viable as a business or otherwise and may dissolve or fail to launch.

Risk of Malfunction in the investFeed Application
It is possible that the investFeed application malfunctions in an unfavorable way,
including one that results in the loss of FEED.

Unanticipated Risks
Cryptographic Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks
discussed in this White Paper, there are risks that the investFeed team cannot anticipate.
Further risks may materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the discussed
risks or the emergence of new risks.

Abstract
Lunyr (pronounced “lunar”) is an Ethereum­based decentralized crowdsourced
encyclopedia which rewards users with app tokens for peer­reviewing and contributing
information. We aim to be the starting point of the internet for finding reliable, accurate
information. Our long­term vision is to develop a knowledge base API that developers
can use to create next generation decentralized applications in Artificial Intelligence,
Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and more.

Market
A strategic component of the Lunyr platform is its advertising system, which allows for
the purchase of advertising on the platform using Lunyr tokens (“LUN”). Although
the Lunyr platform is unique in its design, decentralization, and vision, it can be
compared to Wikipedia.
Wikipedia today ranks as the sixth most visited site in the world according to Alexa
rankings1. It attracts 470 million unique visitors who view over 19 billion pages per
2
month . Estimating the amount of advertising revenue Wikipedia could generate if
it allowed advertising on its pages provides clues to the potential demand for
LUN:
● In 2006, Jason Calcanis, the cofounder of Weblogs, Inc, which was acquired by
AOL, published an article about Wikipedia estimating an annual advertising
3
revenue potential of $100MM .

Alexa is an Amazon.com company that provides commercial web traffic data and analytics.

Calcanis, Jason. "Wikipedia leaves $100M on the table (or "PLEASE Jimbo, reconsider–media philanthropy could change the
world!")." Calacanis.com. 28 Oct. 2006.

● In 2008, BusinessInsider.com performed an analysis of Wikipedia and arrived at
4
an annual advertising revenue potential of $350MM .
● In 2011, Vincent Juhel published a thesis about Wikipedia for HEC Paris, and
5
arrived at an annual advertising revenue potential of $1.6 billion dollars .

Vision
We will initially focus on fine­tuning the system to improve accuracy, increase content,
and grow readership. Once the knowledge base matures, we will attract a wider
audience by encouraging contributions of near real­time data on world events and
translations in multiple languages. Ultimately, Lunyr intends to establish its brand
globally as a reliable, accurate decentralized knowledge base.
Taking it a step further, we will grow the ecosystem by developing an API that will attract
developers. This Lunyr API will allow developers to use the knowledge base as a
backbone for creating next generation decentralized applications in Artificial
Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and more.

Lunyr API
The Lunyr API holds promise for significantly changing existing business models and
creating new ones. The Ethereum blockchain currently has no knowledge of the real
world, yet most useful applications require real world information. Through the Lunyr
API, decentralized applications will be able to tap into the knowledge base and grab
accurate data on real world events and information. This leads to immediate benefits for

Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality applications.

Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence projects similar to Siri or Amazon Echo are enhanced with the
Lunyr API. When users ask fact­based questions, the decentralized application can dig
through the Lunyr knowledge base and provide users with reliable, accurate answers.

Virtual Reality
The Lunyr API will enhance the intimate and visceral experience of interactive virtual
worlds. Imagine putting on a virtual reality headset that lets you experience walking on
the surface of Mars. As you walk along the cold, red­dusted ground, information about
key landmarks and giant dust storms appear. All of this information is drawn from the
knowledge base.

Augmented Reality
The Lunyr API can be the foundation for learning­based applications in Augmented
Reality. Imagine you are at the beach on a sunny day and you see beautiful flowers by
the seashore. You want to know what they are so you put on augmented reality glasses,
which will identify the flowers, tap into the knowledge base, and give you all the
information you need to satisfy your curiosity.

Problem
Current crowdsourced knowledge bases face problems with centralization, censorship,
and inaccuracy.

Centralization
Centralized systems represent single points of failure controlled by central authorities.
Individuals relying on these systems must trust that authorities will not abuse their
power to forward self­serving agendas. Yet, resisting the temptation to abuse power is
difficult in practice for even the most respected authorities. In 2012, Wikipedia
deliberately shut down for 24 hours to protest against internet piracy laws, preventing
individuals worldwide from accessing any information6.

Censorship
Centralized systems are vulnerable to censorship. Governments ruling through
oppression exert control over citizens by prohibiting access to free knowledge. Syria
ranks among the governments where internet censorship is pervasive. Syria blocks

websites for political reasons and arrests those who access them7. Previously, Syria
blocked the Arabic Wikipedia from all Internet Service Providers in the country,
prohibiting even university students from accessing Wikipedia8.

Inaccuracy
On Wikipedia, many articles can be edited by anyone with an internet connection.
Therefore, users can easily falsify information. Although popular articles with
inaccuracies are likely to be quickly corrected, less popular articles can go uncorrected
for months. For example, John Seigenthaler, a former assistant to U.S. Senator Robert
Kennedy, was falsely implicated in the assassinations of the Kennedy brothers on his
Wikipedia biography for over four months9.

Solution
Lunyr’s innovative platform solves the problems of centralization, censorship, and
inaccuracy seen in current knowledge bases.

Decentralization
The Lunyr platform is built on top of Ethereum and is therefore decentralized,
censorship­resistant, and autonomous. No single point of failure exists. No central
authority or middle man owns or can corrupt the information. The rules in which people
interact with the knowledge base and with one another are mutually agreed upon and
enforced through smart contracts, which are publicly verifiable on the blockchain.

Token Incentive System
Ethereum enables the creation of app tokens, which can be used in an incentive system
to replace intermediaries. In Lunyr’s system, tokens play a key role in providing
economic incentives so that the rational behavior of individuals results in common good.
Unlike in Wikipedia where volunteers must donate their time to contribute and validate
information, in Lunyr’s platform, contributors are rewarded for their work and are
incentivized to continue increasing the value of the ecosystem.

Mandatory Peer Review
Drive­by vandalism and corruption are eliminated in the Lunyr platform. All content
submissions go through a mandatory peer review process and are not committed to the
knowledge base until validated for reliability and accuracy. A powerful incentive system
enabled by app tokens ensures that peer reviewers act in the best interest of the

ecosystem.

Platform Design
Lunyr’s innovative platform design aligns each individual’s rational economic behavior
with benefitting the whole ecosystem.

Peer Review
The contributor’s workflow begins with adding or editing information in the knowledge
base in hopes of receiving rewards. Each contributor’s submission costs gas, so
flooding the system with junk has its economic limits, just as in Ethereum. All
submissions go through a mandatory peer review process and are not committed
to the knowledge base unless approved. Every submission requires sources for
reviewers to validate the submission’s reliability and accuracy. Hence, spam, fake, or
malicious content will be filtered out.
Every user who submits a contribution is also required to peer review other
9

submissions. We use Machine Learning to match peer reviewers with topics with which
they will likely be familiar. Submissions are not committed unless they pass the
judgment of multiple peer reviewers.
It is crucial that peer reviewers are also contributors to ensure that only individuals who
are economically aligned with the well being of the ecosystem are able to peer review
submissions. Bad actors who try to attack the system will be fighting against legions of
good actors driven by a powerful incentive system.

App Tokens
Once the submission passes peer review, the contributor is rewarded Contribution
(CBN) and Honor (HNR) tokens. Neither CBN nor HNR can be transferred to other
individuals, which ensures that only users who have committed to the well­being of the
ecosystem hold CBN and HNR.
CBN are used to calculate how many LUN an individual will be rewarded for the current
reward period. CBN are automatically consumed after LUN rewards are distributed for
the two­week reward period. LUN are used to purchase advertising on the platform.
HNR is used to propose and vote on issues in the Dispute and Resolution system. It is
consumed upon use.

Dispute and Resolution
The dispute and resolution system exists to solve any content and quality issues that
slipped through the peer review system. Issues such as malicious content, vandalism,
and content reorganization are dealt with here. Proposals and votes cost HNR. It is
important that HNR is only held by users who have committed to the ecosystem to align
their proposal and voting behavior with increasing the value of the ecosystem.

LUN Pool
LUN rewards come from a pool of LUN that accumulates and is distributed to
contributors at the end of every two­week reward period. The number of LUN that an
individual contributor is rewarded is based on the percent of total CBN they hold by the
end of each two­week period. Smart contracts ensure that the distribution will be
handled with transparency and fairness.
The LUN Pool comes from two sources:
● New LUN that are created and distributed periodically at two­week intervals
● LUN that are used to purchase advertising
The supply of LUN grows at an annual rate of 3% of the initial token supply. This growth
10

will not start until the Beta release on the Mainnet. These additional LUN provide fuel for
the ecosystem to grow in the beginning. At the same time, the effective inflation
decreases over time towards zero, also known as disinflation.
Lunyr receives 15% of the LUN pool each two­week period. This allocation aligns
Lunyr’s incentive with growing the ecosystem. Since Lunyr’s primary source of value is
in LUN, Lunyr’s well­being is tied to the well­being of the ecosystem. Therefore, the
rational behavior of Lunyr is to continually upgrade and improve the ecosystem so that it
grows in value for all participants.
Outside the LUN pool, Lunyr may sell additional LUN to purchasers in the future. It may
do so through exchanges, the blockchain or in other ways.
Lunyr may make changes to the size of the LUN pool, LUN distribution and other
related matters that it believes, in its reasonable judgment, are beneficial to the LUN
platform growth and development, or it considers reasonable under the circumstances.
Keep in mind that any corrupt behavior would be irrational for Lunyr to do. Lunyr will be
holding onto LUN and any decisions that dilute the value of LUN and devalue the
knowledge base would be harmful to Lunyr.

Advertising
LUN are used to place advertisements on the platform. The ads are text­based such as
those seen in Quora. We use Machine Learning to make ads content­aware. Ads are
not committed to the platform until they pass through the mandatory peer review
system.
Ads are a crucial component of the Lunyr ecosystem. They create a powerful demand
for LUN from those with financial resources. Ads provide the economic force that drives
network effects as more contributors and readers join the ecosystem.

Roadmap
Lunyr is committed to completing each milestone on the roadmap. In addition to
remaining open and transparent on communication channels, we intend to also provide
progress updates.
We will make the following materials available:
● Development newsletters
● Blog posts of research and development

Crowdsale
The initial distribution of LUN will be determined through a Crowdsale. LUN may be
purchased during the Crowdsale pursuant to a Presale Purchase Agreement at an
expected distribution of 44 LUN per Ether. LUN are purchased by sending Ether to the
13

Crowdsale token contract according to our instructions.
The Crowdsale will aim to begin March 29, 2017 at 16:00 UTC and continue for four
weeks, or until the maximum number of LUN are purchased. The actual start and end
time will depend on Ethereum block numbers, which will be announced on the Lunyr
community channels. If the Crowdsale fails to result in a minimum number of LUN, then
Ether sent to purchase LUN will be returned.
The Crowdsale token contract address to which Ether will be sent to purchase LUN
according to our instructions and start and end block numbers will be announced on the

The overall initial distribution of LUN will be as follows:
○ 78% for Crowdsale purchasers.
○ 15% for Lunyr founders, employees, and advisors distributed to a time­locked
vault that prohibits LUN transfers for 180 days.
○ 5% for marketing and promotion distributed to the Lunyr multisig wallet.
○ 2% for Bug Bounty distributed to the Lunyr multisig wallet.

Crowdsale Token Contract Guidelines
Before the Crowdsale:
○ Any Ether sent to the token contract will be rejected.
During the Crowdsale:
○ Any Ether sent to the token contract according to our instructions will result in an
allocation of LUN to the purchaser at a distribution of 44 LUN per Ether.
○ LUN cannot be transferred during the Crowdsale period.
15

After the Crowdsale:
○ Users may transfer LUN to another address.
○ The crowdsale token contract creates additional tokens to arrive at the token
supply distribution.
○ The Lunyr Token contract is now finalized, however, upgraded releases of the
token contract adding core features and improvements are to be expected.

Security Audit
Lunyr is committed to ensuring the security of its platform. With each product release on
the Mainnet, Lunyr commits to performing a security audit with both internal and
external reviewers. Additionally, there will be a Bug Bounty program that rewards
developers for finding security and other related issues.

DISCLAIMER
NOT AN OFFER TO SOLICIT SECURITIES AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LUN
AND THE LUNYR APPLICATION
Last Updated March 7, 2017
This document is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an
offer or solicitation to sell shares or securities in Lunyr Inc. or any related or
associated company. Any such offer or solicitation would only be made by a
confidential offering memorandum and in accordance with applicable securities
and other laws. None of the information or analyses presented are intended to
form the basis for any investment decision, and no specific recommendations are
intended. Accordingly, this document does not constitute investment advice or
counsel or solicitation for investment in any security. This document does not
constitute or form part of, and should not be construed as, any offer for sale or
subscription of, or any invitation to offer to buy or subscribe for, any securities,
nor should it or any part of it form the basis of, or be relied on in any connection
with, any contract or commitment whatsoever. Lunyr expressly disclaims any and
all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage of any kind
whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from: (i) reliance on any information
contained in this document, (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such
information or (iii) any action resulting therefrom.
The Lunyr token, or “LUN”, is a cryptographic token used by the Lunyr application.
LUN is not a cryptocurrency.
At the time of this writing, (i) with the exception of being used to place ads on the Lunyr
platform, LUN cannot be exchanged for goods or services, (ii) LUN has no known uses
outside the Lunyr application, and (iii) LUN cannot be traded on any known exchanges.
LUN is not an investment.
There is no guarantee – indeed there is no reason to believe – that the LUN you
purchase will increase in value. It may – and probably will at some point – decrease in
value. Those who do not actually use their LUN honestly and fairly may lose their right
to use LUN and may lose their LUN to those that do use LUN honestly and fairly.

17

LUN is not evidence of ownership or right to control.
Controlling LUN does not grant its controller ownership or equity in Lunyr, or the Lunyr
application. LUN does not grant any right to participate in the control, direction or
decision making of Lunyr or the Lunyr application.

RISK DISCLOSURES
1) Risk of Losing Access to LUN Due to Loss of Credentials
The purchaser’s LUN may be associated with a Lunyr account until they are distributed
to the purchaser. The Lunyr account can only be accessed with login credentials
selected by the purchaser. The loss of these credentials will result in the loss of LUN.
Best practices dictate that purchasers safely store credentials in one or more backup
locations geographically separated from the working location.
2) Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol
LUN and the Lunyr application are based on the Ethereum protocol. As such, any
malfunction, unintended function, unexpected functioning of or attack on the Ethereum
protocol may cause the Lunyr application or LUN to malfunction or function in an
unexpected or unintended manner. Ether, the native unit of account of the Ethereum
protocol may itself lose value in ways similar to LUN, and also other ways. More
information about the Ethereum protocol is available at http://www.ethereum.org.
3) Risks Associated with Purchaser Credentials
Any third party that gains access to or learns of the purchaser’s login credentials or
private keys may be able to dispose of the purchaser’s LUN. To minimize this risk, the
purchaser should guard against unauthorized access to their electronic devices.
4) Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions
Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies
around the world. The functioning of the Lunyr application and LUN could be impacted
by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, including the licensing of or restrictions
on the use, sale, or possession of digital tokens like LUN, which could impede, limit or
end the development of the Lunyr application.
5) Risk of Alternative, Unofficial Lunyr Application
Following the Crowdsale and the development of the initial version of the LUN platform,
it is possible that alternative applications could be established, which use the same
open source code and protocol underlying the Lunyr application. The official Lunyr
application may compete with these alternative, unofficial LUN­based applications,
18

which could potentially negatively impact the Lunyr application and LUN, including its
value.
6) Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Lunyr Application or Distributed Applications
It is possible that the Lunyr application will not be used by a large number of
businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public
interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of
interest could negatively impact LUN and the Lunyr application.
7) Risk that the Lunyr Application, As Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations
of Lunyr or the Purchaser
The Lunyr application is presently under development and may undergo significant
changes before release. Any expectations or assumptions regarding the form and
functionality of the Lunyr application or LUN (including participant behavior) held by
Lunyr or the purchaser may not be met upon release, for any number of reasons
including mistaken assumptions or analysis, a change in the design and implementation
plans and execution of the Lunyr application.
8) Risk of Theft and Hacking
Hackers or other groups or organizations or countries may attempt to interfere with the
Lunyr application or the availability of LUN in any number of ways, including service
attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus based
attacks.
9) Risk of Security Weaknesses in the LUN Application Core Infrastructure
Software
The Lunyr application consists of open source software that is based on other open
source software. There is a risk that the Lunyr team, or other third parties may
intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core
infrastructural elements of the Lunyr application interfering with the use of or causing
the loss of LUN.
10) Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of
Cryptography
Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum
computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Lunyr platform, which could
result in the theft or loss of LUN.
11) Risk of LUN Mining Attacks
19

As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens and cryptocurrencies, the blockchain
used for the Lunyr application is susceptible to mining attacks, including double­spend
attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish­mining” attacks, and race condition
attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Lunyr application, LUN, and
expected proper execution and sequencing of Ethereum contract computations. Despite
the efforts of the Lunyr team, the risk of known or novel mining attacks exists.
12) Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the Lunyr Application
While LUN should not be viewed as an investment, it may have value over time. That
value may be limited if the Lunyr application lacks use and adoption. If this becomes the
case, there may be few or no markets following the launch of the platform, potentially
having an adverse impact on LUN.
13) Risk of an Illiquid Market for LUN
There very well may never be a secondary market for LUN. There are currently no
exchanges upon which LUN would trade. If ever exchanges do develop, they will likely
be relatively new and subject to poorly understood regulatory oversight. They may
therefore be more exposed to fraud and failure than established, regulated exchanges
for other products and have a negative impact on LUN.
14) Risk of Uninsured Losses
Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, funds held using
the Lunyr application or Ethereum network are generally uninsured. In the event of any
loss, there is no public insurer, such as the FDIC, or private insurer, to offer recourse to
the purchaser.
15) Risk of Dissolution of the Lunyr Project
It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including an unfavorable fluctuation in
the value of Ether, development issues with the Lunyr application, the failure of
business relationships, or competing intellectual property claims, the Lunyr project may
no longer be viable as a business or otherwise and may dissolve or fail to launch.
16) Risk of Malfunction in the Lunyr Application
It is possible that the Lunyr application malfunctions in an unfavorable way, including
one that results in the loss of LUN.
17) Unanticipated Risks
Cryptographic tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks
discussed in this White Paper, there are risks that the Lunyr team cannot anticipate.
20

Further risks may materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the
discussed risks or the emergence of new risks.

Abstract
MinexCoin is a global payment system built on the eponymous low-volatility
crypto-asset regulated by an autonomous algorithm with methods proven on
traditional financial markets.
MinexCoin asset is a low-volatility cryptocurrency with predictable and dirigible
price development. It may be employed both as a means of settlement and a
means of saving. Long-term value of the coin is based on its annual growth of
33.6%. In order to reduce its volatility, such supply/demand regulation tools as
market interventions and coin parking are used.

Addressed Issues
Cryptocurrency is a decentralized blockchain-based financial system,
immutability and autonomy being its most celebrated features. Cryptocurrencies
enable one to bypass intermediaries and remain independent from traditional
financial institutions. However, neither cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin,
managed to become a commonly used monetary asset. Merchants and service
providers are reluctant to accept cryptocurrency payments as it involves
additional risks of exchange losses and regulatory issues.
An instrument capable of becoming a perfect global payments system is
commonly used as a speculative asset. This project is devised as a solution for
the fundamental problem in question, and takes into account the problems and
challenges faced by the global finance system.

1

The Three Whales
We distinguish three kinds of crypto-market actors.
The first is traders or people making short and medium-term investments in
cryptocurrency in order to quickly make profit from exchange margin.
The second is investors. Investors are interested in cryptocurrencies as a means
of long-term storage and growth of their capital.
The third is users or those using cryptocurrencies for routine economic activities
like remittances, purchases, etc.
We believe that users are quite an important group as they make the
cryptocurrency sufficiently liquid. However, existing cryptocurrencies hardly meet
their demands. As a result, the lack of merchants and service providers causes
the numbers of medium and long-term investors to grow slowly because of minor
involvement of cryptocurrencies in real economy. The lack of long-term investors
not interested in exchange gambling, in turn, enables traders to manipulate
currency’s exchange rates thus aggravating its volatility. This vicious circle
prevents any crypto-asset from becoming an established means of payment.

Volatility is a Problem
High volatility is amongst the biggest disadvantages of bitcoin and similar
cryptocurrencies. It hinders it from becoming a means of storage and exchange
of value on the global market. Seasoned traders may get high profits from
speculating on exchange margins, yet the risks pertaining to uncontrollable price
fluctuations scare rookie users and online businesses away from
cryptocurrencies.

2

Stability as an Answer
Stable cryptocurrencies are the solution enabling merchants to enjoy all the
advantages of blockchain technology while keeping away from losses caused my
major price fluctuations.
A stable cryptocurrency is a coin whose price is kept within a certain range with a
set of financial mechanisms and algorithms. Existing solutions employ various
means to maintain stable prices of their cryptocurrencies.
DigixDAO backs every DGX token with an equivalent amount of gold physically
stored in a Singapore vault. For that reason, the token’s price correlates with the
price of gold.
ChronoBank creates its own labor market where each LH token is pegged to the
average worth of a work-hour.
Tether tokens are backed with U.S. Dollars kept on a private company’s b
ank
account.
MakerDAO maintains stable price of its DAI tokens with a complex red-tape
system hardly comprehensible for those lacking profound cryptocurrency
savviness.
In our opinion, the existing projects all feature several fundamental flaws. They’re
either pegged to an unstable asset, and therefore can’t be considered currencies
with stable and predictable purchasing power; or backed by an immovable asset,
and therefore are of no interest for traders and investors; or, while promising
some predictable profit to their investors, lack transparency; or make it too hard
for an average user to assess their price growth.
MinexCoin offers an innovative solution which creates an autonomous financial
system that meets the demands of all three kinds of market actors.

3

MinexCoin: a Unique Innovative Solution
There are two factors that make MinexCoin unique:
— Low volatility of the coin (within a five-percent range) achieved autonomously
with traditional financial tools;
— Predictable and controllable annual growth of the coin’s price which correlates
with average annual price growth calculated for a portfolio of most popular
altcoins (around 33.6 per cent).
Thanks to its unique features, MinexCoin is a multi-purpose tool equally useful
for trading, long-term investment and routine financial operations.
Traders, whose speculations often tend to destroy cryptocurrency ecosystems,
have a constructive role in MinexCoin’s system. Encouragement of trading
activity will become a tool that the coin’s autono mous algorithm uses to keep the
token’s price within a certain range.
Controllable price surge over time will make the coin a profitable asset for
investors. Coin parking, which is the second volatility control tool in MinexCoin,
meets the strategy of medium and long-term investment.
Finally, thanks to price predictability, easy conversion and high-speed
transactions, regular users and online retailers will be able to use MinexCoin as
means of payment and value storage. MinexCoin excludes both exchange losses
and service payments.

MinexBank: Smart Algorithms
MinexCoin tackles the issue of high volatility by automatically regulating demand
and supply at exchanges. To do that, it uses certain algorithms that encourage
coin holders to buy, sell or keep their assets depending on the balance of supply
and demand at the given time. Those algorithms resemble activity of central
banks that maintain the cost of their national currency, so they are collectively
known as MinexBank.
4

For functioning of an algorithm of modifying interest rates on “parking”
operations, in real-time the following steps are to be completed:
1. To determine an average weighted cross-rate of MNC/$ to a
basket of 10 currencies, which are in the top as for the
capitalization level, in real-time.
2. To correlate an average weighted cross-rate of MNC to the
capitalization level and a share in total capitalization of each of 10
specified currencies.
The formula for determining an average weighted cross-rate of MNC to
the basket of currencies is as follows:
10

= ∑( *

* );

=1

Where
is an average weighted cross-rate of MNC/$.
A simplified version of the formula is as follows:
=(

1*

*

1

)+(

2

*

*

2

)+(

3

*

*

3

) + ... + (

10

*

*

10

);

is an average weighted cross-rate of MNC/$,
Where
1 , 2 , 3 … 10 is a current rate of each currency to BTC,
is a current rate of BTC to USD,
1 , 2 , 3 … 10 is a current market capitalization of each currency,
is the total market capitalization of Top 10 cryptocurrencies.
In such a way we get unbiased cross-rate of MNC to USD. The
change of this rate is influenced not only by the price of Bitcoin, but also
by prices of all other highly liquid cryptocurrencies. In addition, in real
time an average weighted rate of MNC is correlated to the change of
capitalization of each currency separately, and the total capitalization of
these cryptocurrencies.
In fact, we are locking the MNC rate to a basket of
cryptocurrencies; that is more unbiased marker of MNC price, compared
to locking using cross-rate of Bitcoin only.

5

3. To set index of estimated value of MNC at
time, on the
basis of the increase of МNС estimated value by 33.6% per year.
Since calculation of estimated value of MNC is to be made with a
frequency of 1 second, calculation of change in price per second is
to be made using a formula as follows:
=

0

*

;

Where
is a current estimated value of MNC to USD,
0 is a price of MNC to USD, following the outcome of the second stage
of ICO,
is the amount of time in seconds passed since the start of Minexbank
algorithm operation up to the present moment,
is an index of the increase of MNC price per second, which is
calculated using the formula as follows:
= √1.336;

Where
is
the
amount
of
seconds
=365*24*60*60=31 536 000.
Therefore:
31449600
=
√1.336;

in

a

year,

4. To enable the algorithm to compare two indexes, and change
“parking” operations discount rates in case of deviation of current
price from the calculated one.

Changes of “parking” operations rate will be carried out taking into
account such market figures as quantity demanded, quantity supplied
and price velocity, rather than using the positive correlation principle.

6

MinexBank is a closed source app, though some of its features are accessible to
users via the official website. At MinexBank, users may browse existing interest
rates for parking payments, and file up a request to receive interest for coin
parking operations. In order to protect the assets, the bank’s reserve is stored in
cold wallets.

Hybrid Governance
At present stage, MinexBank uses hybrid governance, which implies that the
algorithm’s decisions are monitored by a group of professional economists. At
early phases of the system’s operation, the team reserves the right to introduce
amendments to the algorithm’s parameters in order to promptly prevent emerging
risks and guarantee steady work of the entire system.
Once the algorithm is fine-tuned, MinexBank will become a decentralized
autonomous organization. At final phases, the platform’s financial activity will be
completely free of human involvement, and use algorithms set earlier.

Main Exchange
While assessing market conditions, MinexBank will invoke asset price at the
main exchange, which is the exchange where MinexBank stores, buys and sells
its assets. The selected exchange will have to be the most secure of all currently
in existence. Prices for assets traded elsewhere will correlate with those at the
main one thanks to trader arbitration.

7

How It Actually Works
The main purpose of MinexBank is to stabilize the exchange rate within the
range of no more than 5% of the previous day’s closure price. The five per cent
growth owes to the practice of global stock exchanges. Once the values are
reached, stock markets halt the trading, thus preventing speculators and
misguided investors from dictating their own prices.
Once the limit values of the five per cent range are reached, MinexBank has two
options: it either changes interest rates for parking payouts, or intervenes to keep
the price within the preset range. Coin parking and intervention are the basic
financial instruments used by MinexBank.

Parking
Parking means that coins are voluntarily withdrawn from the market by a user
who temporarily suspends them in their wallet. The ‘parking’ user is eligible to
receive interest. Users will be able to choose the type of parking depending on
the time they undertake to store coins in their wallets without using them online.
There are three kinds of parking:
Day (24 hours): for short-term impact
Month (30 days): for medium-term impact
Annual (365 days): for long-term impact.
Average reference rate for parking payouts will gradually go down, yet, thanks to
MinexCoin price’s growth, the actual parking revenue will only grow over time.
Average basic rates for parking payouts:*
2017: 70%
2018: 45-55%
2019: 25-40%

8

*The values are determined as default and may be altered by MinexBank
algorithms either way depending on market conditions.
If a user withdraws all money from their wallet, MinexBank does not award
interest regardless of how much time there is until parking ends. If, after parking
their coins, the user withdraws a part of their money, the system awards interest
for the parking contract concluded first in case its amount does not exceed
current balance of the user’s wallet.

Interventions
Intervention means that MinexBank buys or sells MinexCoin to keep the
exchange rate within the predetermined range.
Initially, MinexBank has an MNC reserve with an option of continuously filling it
up so that the system could work on a long-term basis and suppress possible
speculative attacks.
The initial reserve is formed by premining 1,500,000 coins. Once there are more
MinexCoins on the market due to additional issuance (miner work rewards), the
reserve will have to be replenished and eventually expanded. The growth will be
ensured by the progressive percentage of payments to MinexBank for each block
solved by miners.
Blocks 1 - 900 001
Blocks 900 001 - 1 800 000
Blocks 1 800 001 - 2 700 000
Blocks 2 700 001 - 3 600 000
Blocks 3 600 001 - 4 500 000
Blocks 4 500 001 - 5 400 000

= 20%
= 30%
= 40%
= 50%
= 60%
= 70%

9

Incentivizing Miners
Miner reward for each formed block comprises 2.5 MinexCoin. Miners will make
progressive payments to MinexBank until block 5,400,000 is reached.
Considering the coin will be worth more over time, fiat equivalent of miner
reward, notwithstanding the continuously growing payments to the bank, will
grow. This will result in increase of the system’s overall capacity, and therefore,
its complexity.
Starting from block 5,400,001 miners will pay stable 20 per cent to MinexBank.
The reward, which is around 2.5 MNC, will be composed of user fees paid for
transactions. The transaction fee itself will comprise 0.00001 MNC.
In order to participate in processing, i.e. mining, each miner has to suspend the
amount of coins corresponding to its mining capacity. The amount is calculated
as 1 MNC per 1 Th/s.

Market Behaviour
In practice, the MinexBank algorithm uses a simple and efficient pattern. As there
are three possible options for market behavior (excessive demand, excessive
supply or supply/demand equilibrium), there are three strategies for MinexBank
behavior as well.

10

Excessive demand

In case of excessive demand, the interest rate for parking payments will
decrease. This will cause asset holders to enter the market, which in turn will
cause the price to go down. In case this method fails to work effectively enough,
MinexBank starts selling the assets itself in order to subdue pressure from
buyers.

11

Excessive supply

In case of excessive supply, the interest rate for parking payments grows, thus
withdrawing the excessive amount from the market. In case this method fails,
MinexBank buys the assets to subdue pressure from sellers.

12

Supply/demand equilibrium

In this case, MinexBank does nothing as the price remains within the
predetermined range.

13

Crowdsale Summary
MinexCoin (MNC) is based on Bitcoin’s source code. We chose bitcoin’s code
base due to its proven reliability. In order to accelerate transactions, block
size was increased to 2 MB while block time was reduced to 2 minutes and
45 seconds.
Most stable cryptocurrencies use two kinds of assets in overall turnover:
traded token shares and a stable coin. During initial coin offerings,
investors are commonly offered to buy shares, not stable coins.
MinexCoin will use a single coin employed both as a means of payment and as a
share.
This
approach
further
protects
MinexCoin
system
from
speculator interference. Another important advantage for investors is that
they receive a reliably stable asset over the ICO, not yet another highly volatile
token.
14

MinexCoin’s ICO campaign incorporates two phases:
Phase one (Subscription) is set to determine applicability, importance and value
of the very concept of creating a low volatile and steadily growing asset, and
inviting prospective users to discuss the matter.
ICO Phase One (Subscription) terms: October 6th, 2016 to December 28th, 2016
Cost of coins/Bonuses for early participants of Phase One (Subscription):

The purpose of Phase Two (Pre-sale) is to determine the market price of the coin
immediately before entering the exchange. The same price is the basic value in
MinexBank’s policy, and is calculated as follows:
Y = ( X + Х1 ) / Z
where Y stands for market exchange rate (basic value in the bank’s algorithm); X
for volume of involved investor funds; X1 for absolute volume of bonuses
accrued by early participants; Z for the amount of coins available for the ICO.
Phase Two (pre-sale) terms: May 15th, 2017 to June 13th, 2017.
Bonuses for early participants of Phase Two (Pre-sale):

15

All money raised over the first two phases of the ICO will be spent
on development and marketing of the product. The coins are subject to
distribution among investors the day after the ICO’s completion.

The Future of Minex
MinexBank’s monetary policy serves the main purpose of making MinexCoin a
global reserve cryptocurrency. In order to attain it, MinexCoin will have to meet
the following principles:
- Simplicity and high speed of transactions
- Exchange rate stability and predictability against U.S. Dollar
- Market cap of $1 trillion

MinexBank will consistently administer policy of increasing MNC price against
USD on the basis of the growth rate of 33.6% annually. Once MinexCoin
issuance is over at block 5,400,000, its price will reach $52,600, and market cap
$1 trillion. This market cap will allow for using MNC as a global payment unit as
the volume of available dollars will have comprised 4.5 to 5 trillion at the time in
question, should the existing trend persists.

Minex Ecosystem
The Minex Systems team intends to implement extended functionality of Minex
Ecosystem by incorporating such applications as Minex Market, Minex
Exchange, and Minex Platform. Implementation of those products seeks to
expand the coin’s sphere of circulation, thus driving demand for it.

Whitepaper
MobileGo Token
www.mobilego.io
After two years of development with gaming industry leaders, Datcroft
LTD., Gamecredits is near completion of development of the first crypto
mobile gaming store. This mobile gaming store has a proprietary payment
gateway that allows gamers to use Gamecredits to buy in-game content.
Gamecredits can be acquired with credit cards and other local payment
methods within this gateway. Over 300 games from 150 developers are already signed on and the Gamecredits Mobile Store is scheduled to
release in early Q2 of 2017.
The MobileGo crowdsale and MobileGo token issuance will help fund marketing and branding of the Gamecredits’ Mobile Store and the development
of smart contract technology within the platform using the Ethereum
blockchain.
MobileGo tokens will be used to gamify the mobile platform, and to incentivize gamers for loyalty and participation through rewards. MobileGo tokens will also allow for smart contract technology. MobileGo tokens will allow for the development of a decentralized virtual mobile gamer marketplace, the ability for gamer vs. gamer decentralized match play, and
decentralized tournaments run on smart contracts.

Market and Industry
In 2016, global gaming industry revenue was $99.6 billion. By 2019, the
industry is expected to grow by 20% to $118.6 billion.

* http://resources.newzoo.com/global-mobile-market-report
Of that growth, the global mobile gaming market is the fastest growing sector. The mobile gaming market was $36.7 billion in 2016. At current growth
rates, the mobile gaming market is expected to grow 58% to $58.1 billion
by 2020.

*https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/global-games-market-reaches-99-6-billion-2016-mobile-generating-37/

The region of greatest growth in mobile gaming markets is Asia, which
consists of 49% of all smart phones users.

* http://resources.newzoo.com/global-mobile-market-report

Current Mobile Gaming Platforms and Stores
The largest concentration of mobile gaming platforms is in China. China
represents 30.2% of the world’s smartphone users. 73.3% of these smartphones are Android. As a result, the majority of mobile gaming revenues are
generated on Android devices. In China, there are over 200 successful third
party mobile stores.

Outside of China, Google Play and Apple currently control over 98% of
the mobile gaming market, creating lack of competition from other 3rd
party gaming platforms.
This monopolization of the market puts major restrictions on most
gaming developers and gamers.
The Gamecredits Mobile Store is an alternative choice and the first one
built around cryptocurrency to solve issues in the larger gaming industry.
This mobile gaming store app is in final testing now and will be available
on Android in early Q2 2017.

Gamecredits Gaming Store and Mobile Platform
Current screenshots of Gamecredits Mobile Store:

This mobile platform currently has over 300 games from 150 developers
scheduled for its initial launch. We estimate that this platform will have over

1000 games available for play sometime in mid to late 2017. Names of
these games and developers will be released beginning in April 2017.

Benefits for Game Developers
The response we have received from game developers has been
overwhelmingly positive. The reasons are many.
Currently game developers using Google Play and Apple Store pay up to
30% of their revenues to these platforms. Our platform revenue model will
take only 10% of revenues.
In addition, mobile gaming companies have to wait up to 60 days for
pay-outs. Our platform will make payouts much more quickly.
Game developers also have long waiting periods to have their new
releases added to these platforms. Our platform allows for quick and easy
integration of SDKs. We achieve this by having an integration environment
that allows developers to upload their APK file. Our system then checks
Google Play for verification and downloads the vetted APK from there. In
this way, we avoid any backlog while maintaining quality control. From
there our system integrates the SDK and all connections without requiring
any development resources from the game developer.

On average, 1k games are added to platforms like Google Play and Apple
every day.* The vast majority of those are never seen by games on these
platforms while the largest games such as Pokemon Go, Candy Crush
and Clash of Clans are featured for months at a time. We will actively work
in conjunction with developers to help gain exposure on our platform.

*http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/apple-app-store-growing-by-over-1000-apps-per-day-1504801
For a complete list of 11 advantages our platform offers to game developers go to www.gamecredits.com.

Benefits to Gamers
Gamers will get more for their money using our mobile store. Game
developers will incentivize gamers to use Gamecredits through in-game
coupons and rewards. MobileGO token holders will be able to earn additional
dis-counts when using Gamecredits to purchase in-game content.

Our platform payment gateway allows gamers many more options for
payment. Google and Apple only allow deposits from credits cards. The
Gamecredits Mobile Game app will allow the use of credit cards,
Gamecredits, and local payment methods.
Unlike Google and Apple that have strict deposit limit amounts, our platform
will allow for unlimited deposits.

The Opportunity With MobileGO Crowdsale
With a $50 billion mobile market, acquiring just a fraction of market
penetration results in large revenues: 0.2% market share alone is $100
million a year.
The MobileGo crowdsale will fund us to expand more quickly to acquire this
market share.
A minimum of 50% of all funds raised in the crowdsale will be used for
marketing. A large component of marketing will be direct gamer acquisition
knows as installs. Installs will be purchased from many different traffic
sources, including Facebook, Google Adwords, offer walls and specialized
gaming traffic sources.
In addition to traditional forms of marketing, the functionality of
MobileGo token smart contract technology allows us to create a number
of unique value-added features for the mobile platform.

MobileGo Tokens and the Gamification of the Mobile Platform
Gamers that use the mobile platform will create a profile. A profile will have
a certain social status based on games played, referrals, and social
interaction on the platform.

Gamers that achieve certain levels of status will be rewarded with
MobileGo tokens. Gamers that own or have acquired a certain number of
MobileGo tokens may be eligible for the following incentives:
A) Coupon reward discounts when using Gamecredits to purchase ingame content.
B) Free entrance into VIP gaming tournaments will real cash prizes
C) Private beta testing of certain new release games in the store.

Real Money Tournaments
Through tournaments on our mobile platform, we aim to duplicate the
success that BigPoint had in the PC/Web gaming market.
At its height, BigPoint attracted hundreds of thousands of new users daily
to its web gaming platform by having tournaments and free cash pools.
The Gamecredits Mobile platform will have both centralized and
decentralized gaming tournaments.

Decentralized Tournaments
Decentralized tournaments on the platform will be set up and run by users
of the platform who have MobileGo tokens. MobileGo tokens will be the
only token in the decentralized tournament ecosystem.
As FirstBlood plans to use smart contracts to allow gamers to create
tournaments for Web/PC games, the Gamecredits Mobile Store will
similarly allow gamers to create tournaments for mobile MMOs.
Similar to FirstBlood, these tournaments will be under full control of
the players, with witnesses to verify the tournaments.

One difference is that with the Gamecredits Mobile Platform these
tournaments will not need their own independent mobile app
environment. Instead, they will be run inside the Gamecredits mobile
platform.

Centralized Tournaments
Centralized gaming tournaments will be run through gaming developers on
the platform to promote their games. These tournaments will be sponsored
tournaments to encourage player participation within a particular game.

Gamers that have achieved a certain profile status based on MobileGo tokens earned or held may have special eligibility into some or all of these
tournaments.

Decentralized Virtual marketplace
MobileGo tokens will be the centerpiece for a decentralized virtual
market-place within the Gamecredits mobile platform.

This marketplace will allow gamers to trade virtual items from mobile
games directly with each other using MobileGo tokens. These trades will
occur on the Ethereum blockchain.

Profit Generation on the Mobile Platform
Industry averages for the cost of acquiring a gamer range from $.83 $1.71. The average amount spent by gamers on mobile platforms ranges
from $1.15-$4.40.

To estimate profits on the platform we will take the three largest markets Asia, North American and Western Europe. On average the marketing cost
to acquire a gamer is $1.50. The average revenue spent on the platform
month per gamer is $3.71.
With this example we should expect for every $1.50 spent in marketing the
platform to receive $3.71 in monthly revenue as a baseline.

In addition, industry platform averages show that for every one gamer
acquired for a popular game you can expect two referrals. We prefer to
project at a 1 to 1 ratio of gamer to referral. Therefore, for every $1.50
spent we will assume $7.42 in monthly revenue. If we adjust for a 10%
monthly attrition rate, the total annual platform revenue would be $53.16.
Our platform will take 10% commission on all game and in-game revenue.
Based on these averages, we expect to make around $5.13 of annual
commissions per gamer on our platform. Subtracting the cost to acquire a
gamer ($1.50) our annual profit per gamer would be $3.81. It is our goal is
to be profitable by Q4 of 2017.

Profits To Burn MobileGo Token
We will use a percentage of the profits from the Gamecredits mobile store
to buy back and burn MobileGo tokens.
Once the crowdsale is completed, a marketing fund will be created with a
minimum of 50% of funds raised. The allocation of these resources and
the profits that these resources generate will be audited and made
available to MobileGo Token holders.
A percentage of our profits will be used to continue marketing and a
percentage of profits will be used to buy back MobileGo tokens.

Allocation of MobileGo Tokens
100 Million MobileGo Tokens will be created. These will be issued once
the crowdsale is completed.
Discounts will be available for first day crowd sale participants. Discounts
may be available for interested parties prior to the crowd sale. For
information contact crowdsale@mobilego.io.
MobileGo Tokens can be purchased with BTC, ETH, WAVES, and GAME.
All funds will be received and held in multi-signature wallets.

Distribution of MobileGo Tokens
100 Million Total
70 Million to crowdsale participants
30 Million retained by the MobileGo Foundation for crowdsale marketing,
mobile platform partnerships, employee expansion and future development
over the next 5 years. These tokens will be held in a multi-signature wallet.

Distribution of Funds
All funds received will be disbursed by the MobileGo Foundation.
Minimum 50% towards direct marketing for gamer installs.
20% for development of decentralized virtual marketplace, decentralized
gamer vs. gamer match wagering, and decentralized tournament
environment.
Up to 30% retained for legal, payment processing float, future development
related to gamification of the mobile gaming platform and expansion related
to
marketing.

Current Development and Release Roadmap
April 25th - May 24th: MobileGo crowdsale
May - June: Gamecredits Mobile Store Public Launch
May - June: Gamecredits accepted for mobile store games and ingame content purchases
June - August: marketing funds deployed
July - August: first centralized tournaments on platform
Q4 2017 - complete gamification of mobile platform including MobileGo
token integration into player profiles, statuses, and rewards
Q4 2017 - complete decentralized virtual gamer marketplace
Q1 2018 - complete integration of decentralized gamer matches and decentralized gamer tournaments

Crowdsale Schedule
Dates for the crowdsale launch April 25 3pm UTC until May 24th 3pm
UTC.
This timeline will coincide closely with the public launch of the Gamecredits
mobile store.
Official dates and discount schedules will be announced in the
coming weeks.
Before the crowdsale begins, we will begin releasing daily reports on the
details of the games and game developers that will be a part of our
initial
mobile
platform
release.

MobileGo Tokens and Gamecredits
While they serve two separate functions, it is important to note the
symbiotic relationship between MobileGo tokens and Gamecredits.
A successful MobileGo crowdsale should have a positive impact on the
Gamecredits ecosystem, economy and price by financing the acquisition of
millions of gamers for the Gamecredits mobile gaming platform.
The more gamers that use the Gamecredits mobile platform the more
Gamecredits should be purchased and spent in games. This should
create more demand for Gamecredits.
In return, the success of the platform should result in a large economy for
the gamification of the platform and the usability of MobileGo tokens
including increased demand for the decentralized marketplace,
decentralized tournaments and gamer vs. gamer matches.

Technical Aspects of Issuance
MobileGo Token Dual Blockchain Issuance
The MobileGo Token will be the first crypto token to be simultaneously issued on the Waves platform and the Ethereum platform. Using a new
technology comprised of a web interface, locked wallets and smart
contracts on the Ethereum side, MobileGo tokens will be dynamically
interchangeable from one blockchain to another as the end user wishes.

Technical Specifications
The token has a fixed supply of 100 million tokens, with the full supply created
on both blockchains. Tokens purchased in ETH will be released to users’
wallets on the Ethereum blockchain, with the balance being locked in a smart
contract. Tokens purchased in fiat, GAME, BTC and WAVES will be

released on the WAVES blockchain, with the balance locked in a
WAVES wallet.
As such, the balance of the ETH smart contract is equal to the liquidity of
the WAVES tokens, and the balance of the WAVES locked wallet is equal
to the liquidity of the ETH token.
At any point that an ETH token holder wants to convert a ETH MobileGo
token for a WAVES token, they send a WAVES address and their ETH tokens to the smart contract, locking the ETH tokens, and releasing the
corresponding WAVES token by sending them to the nominated address.

Likewise, if a WAVES token holder wants to move his token onto the ETH
blockchain they visit the web interface, nominate an ETH address, and
send their WAVES token to the locked wallet. The ETH token is
forwarded immediately.
At any given moment there will be no more than 100 Million available (unlocked) MobileGo tokens.

Example:
$10 million raised in crowdsale:
$4 million raised in ETH
$6 million raised in BTC, GAME and Waves
100 million MobileGo Tokens issued on the Ethereum blockchain;
40 million will be sent to users’ wallets
60 million will remain in the smart contract
100 million MobileGo tokens issued on WAVES blockchain;
60 million will be sent to users’ WAVES wallets
40 million will remain locked on a WAVES node.

Proof Of Concept
A proof of concept smart contract and ‘token flipper’ is nearing completion the smart contract code is available for review at https://etherscan.io/address/0x2c875e5ea4706b1978a41b59edf2d3af31d60e70#code

Advantage of Dual Blockchains

Ethereum
As mentioned throughout the paper, smart contract technology will be used
to implement many new decentralized features on the Gamecredits Mobile
Gaming Platform.

WAVES
WAVES offers several platform characteristics that we find appealing.
These include an intuitively easy to use universal Chrome wallet and
UI and the ability for fiat gateways.
WAVES decentralized asset exchange allows for native token trading without inherent 3rd part regulation and fees. This exchange will be used to
buy back MobileGo tokens with platform profits.

Redundancy and Sustainability
Another security advantage of the dual blockchain issuance is redundancy.
If at any point in the future a critical technical issue were to occur on either
the WAVES platform or Ethereum blockchain, MobileGo tokens would
have the capacity to move to the fully functioning and stable blockchain.
Since data would be in the blockchain, in the event that one blockchain
were to become non-functioning, users would be able to sign a transaction
on a private blockchain proving their ownership. Upon proof of ownership,
tokens would be unlocked from the healthy remaining blockchain and issued to owners.

Synergy
MobileGo Tokens will be built around a synergistic alignment of talents from
different corners of the crypto world. Our core business model aims to be

the first crypto project to successfully bridge the gap between crypto
technologies and the elusive global mainstream consumer base.
MobileGo tokens will help fund marketing that will greatly enhance the
utility and value of Gamecredits. Likewise, we look forward to using the
advantages of WAVES and Ethereum to further build and enhance our
quality products.

Technical Aspects of Payment Gateway
Technological Advances Within Payment Gateway
The Gamecredits mobile store will use a customized and proprietary
centralized payment gateway solution built by our developers. This
payment gateway is currently being beta tested in Datcroft Ltd. games.
This gateway will offer Gamecredits as a featured payment option for
purchasing in-game content. Gamers will be able to acquire Gamecredits
directly within the payment gateway with Bitcoin, credit cards, and other
local payment methods without ever having to leave the mobile app.
Our payment gateway was built for security, scalability and ease of use.
Our Codepay platform is based on Hadoop and HBase. We are also using
Omid as a transactional framework. Also, we have a SQL-over-NoSQL layer which allows easier analytical access to the data. Our goal is to process
Big Data at high speeds. To that end, we have built an analytical cluster
which allows for easy customization.
Load-wise, we have successfully tested 7,000 transactions per second in
a test environment. Results can be seen here:

MobileGo (MGO) Crowdsale: Terms & Conditions
The following Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern the sale of MobileGo cryptographic tokens (“MGO”) to
crowdsale participants (“Purchasers” collectively, and “Purchaser” individually).
This document describes the initial sale in which the MobileGo token (“MGO”) is sold. It is not a solicitation
for investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. Individuals,
businesses, and other organizations should carefully weigh the risks, costs, and benefits of acquiring MGO
early in the initial sale versus waiting to purchase MGO on open, third-party exchanges.
IMPORTANT
Ownership of MGO carries no rights express or implied. Purchases of MGO are non-refundable. Purchasers should
have no expectation of influence over governance of the GameCredits Mobile Platform. The MobileGo Token
crowdsale fund is not owned by GameCredits Inc. This fund is owned by the MobileGo Foundation and is a separate
entity and solely independent ownership structure.
By participating in the sale of MGO, you expressly acknowledge and represent that you have carefully reviewed the
Terms and fully understand the risks, costs, and benefits of purchasing MGO and agree to be bound by these Terms.
As set forth below, you further represent and warrant that, to the extent permitted by law, you are authorized to
purchase MGO in your relevant jurisdiction, are of a legal age to be bound by these Terms, and will not hold liable
for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of, or in any way connected to the sale
of MGO, now or in the future, MobileGo Foundation and its affiliates, and the officers, directors, agents, joint
ventures, employees and suppliers of MobileGo or its affiliates, including Datcroft Games and GameCredits Inc.
WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE MGO IF YOU ARE NOT AN EXPERT IN DEALING WITH
CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SOFTWARE SYSTEMS.
Purchases of MGO should be undertaken only by individuals, entities, or companies that have significant experience
with, and understanding of, the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, like bitcoin (“BTC”), and blockchainbased software systems. Purchasers should have functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms
associated with other cryptographic tokens. While the MobileGo Foundation will be available to assist Purchasers of
MGO during and after the sale, the MobileGo Foundation will not be responsible for lost BTC or MGO resulting
from actions taken by, or omitted by Purchasers. Note, in particular, that MGO Purchasers should take great care to
write down their wallet password and not lose it so as to be sure that they will be able to access their MGO when it
becomes available after the initial sale. If you do not have such experience or expertise, then you should not
purchase MGO or participate in the pre-sale of MGO.
WARNING: CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS MAY EXPERIENCE EXTREME PRICE VOLATILITY.
MobileGo tokens do not represent any formal or legally binding investment. Cryptographic tokens that possess

value in public markets, such as BTC, have demonstrated extreme fluctuations in price over short periods of time on
a regular basis. A Purchaser of MGO should be prepared to expect similar fluctuations, both down and up, in the
price of MGO denominated in BTC or United States dollars (“USD”) or currencies of other jurisdictions. Such
fluctuations are due to market forces and represent changes in the balance of supply and demand. MobileGo
Foundation cannot and does not guarantee market liquidity for MGO and therefore there may be periods of time in
which MGO is difficult to buy. Additionally, due to different regulatory dictates in different jurisdictions and the
inability of citizens of certain countries to open accounts at exchanges located anywhere in the world, the liquidity
of MGO may be markedly different in different countries and this would likely be reflected in significant price
discrepancies. By purchasing MGO, you expressly acknowledge and represent that you fully understand that MGO
may experience volatility in pricing and will not seek to hold any of the MobileGo Foundation Parties liable for any
losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected to, the sale of
MGO.
WARNING: THE PURCHASE OF MGO ENTAILS A NUMBER OF RISKS.
The purchase of MGO carries with it a number of risks. Prior to purchasing MGO, you should carefully consider the
risks listed below and, to the extent necessary, consult an appropriate lawyer, accountant, or tax professional. If any
of the following risks are unacceptable to you, you should not purchase MGO. By purchasing MGO, and to the
extent permitted by law, you are agreeing not to hold any of the MobileGo Foundation Parties liable for any losses
or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected, to the sale of MGO,
including losses associated with the risks set forth below.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1. Overview of Initial Sale of MGO
The MobileGo Foundation will produce a quantity of MGO in a pre-sale event called the initial sale, to be conducted
on its web site at https://mobilego.io (“the initial sale”). The MobileGo Token crowdsale fund is not owned by
GameCredits Inc. This fund is owned by the MobileGo Foundation and is a separate entity and solely independent
ownership structure.
Purchasers in the initial sale will acquire MGO in exchange for BTC, WAVES, ETH and GAME at the USD value
of each investment at the time of investment. Purchasers of MGO in the initial sale will be granted user accounts on
the aforementioned website that will enable them to claim their purchase at the end of the initial sale. All MGO presold in this manner will be created on the Waves and Ethereum networks after the end of the initial sale, although
there are no guarantees that this will occur within a given timeframe. MGO purchased with BTC, WAVES and
GAME
will be created on the Waves blockchain. MGO purchased with ETH will be created on the Ethereum blockchain.
MobileGo Foundation will allocate the purchased MGO to the corresponding user account on the web site,
delivering it to their control.
2. Creation of MGO

MGO will be the first crypto token to be simultaneously issued on the Waves platform and the Ethereum platform.
100 million MGO will be created on the Waves blockchain. A further 100 million MGO will be created on the
Ethereum blockchain. Using a new technology comprised of a web interface, locked wallets and smart contracts on
the Ethereum side, MGO will be dynamically interchangeable from one blockchain to another as the end user
wishes. A total of 100 million tokens will be available, across both blockchains, at any given time. The remaining
100 million will remain locked. No further MGO will ever be created.

TIMING OF SALE
The initial sale will begin on April 25, 2017. The sale will run for 30 days.
MobileGo Foundation reserves the right to change the date when the initial sale will begin and further reserves the
right to extend the sale duration for any reason, including the unavailability of the website https://mobilego.io or
other unforeseen security or procedural issues. Though it does not currently anticipate doing so, MobileGo
Foundation also reserves the right to shorten the sale duration for any reason.
3. MGO Pricing
Based on the performance of other recent blockchain project launches MobileGo management has determined that
this initial sale shall be partitioned and sold at decreasing discount rates as the sale proceeds. Full details about these
price points will be provided in a timely manner to Purchasers in the initial sale and will be available on the website
at the time of purchase.
4. Disclosure of Purchases
To enable MGO Purchasers to have as much information as possible to guide their decision-making process,
MobileGo Foundation will disclose in real time the total funds collected in the MGO initial sale to enable the
Purchaser to develop an understanding of the size of the existing MobileGo funding pool at the time of their MGO
purchase.
5. Purchase of MGO from the mobilego.io Website
MobileGo Foundation will maintain a store interface, which can be used to purchase MGO. The store interface will
be available on the MobileGo website (https://mobilego.io). Instructions for purchasing MGO with BTC and other
cryptocurrencies using the store interface will be embedded and available for review on the MobileGo website
during the duration of the initial sale. Failure to follow these instructions may limit, delay, or prevent a Purchaser
from obtaining MGO. Any questions about these instructions should be directed to support@mobilego.io.
6. Obligation to Determine If Purchaser Can Purchase MGO in Purchaser’s Jurisdiction
The initial sale constitutes the sale of a legal software product under European law. This product sale is conducted
by MobileGo Foundation, a company operating under European law. It is the responsibility of each potential
Purchaser of MGO to determine if the Purchaser can legally purchase MGO in the Purchaser’s jurisdiction.
7. Acceptance of Terms and Conditions of the MobileGo Sale

As a first step in the purchase process, MobileGo Foundation will present the Purchaser with these Terms, and
associated documents. By placing an order for MGO, the Purchaser: (i) consents and agrees to the Terms; (ii)
represents and warrants that the Purchaser is legally permitted to purchase MGO in the Purchaser’s jurisdiction; (iii)
represents and warrants that the Purchaser is of a sufficient age to legally purchase MGO or has received permission
from a legal guardian who has reviewed and agreed to these Terms; (iv) represents and warrants that the Purchaser
will take sole responsibility for any restrictions and risks associated with the purchase of MGO as set forth below;
and (v) represents and warrants that the Purchaser has an understanding of the usage and intricacies of cryptographic
tokens, like BTC, and blockchain-based software systems.
8. Independent Confirmation of Purchases
During the purchase process on the https://mobilego.io website, MobileGo Foundation will provide Purchasers with
a unique intermediary cryptocurrency address. Using this address, Purchasers can track and confirm that the
Purchaser’s cryptocurrency has been received at that address and has been subsequently and automatically sent to
the escrow address. Knowledge of the unique intermediary address does not constitute a purchase receipt or indicate
in any way that any party possessing such knowledge has rights to or ownership of the purchased MGO.
9. Receipt of MGO and the Purchase Email
As part of the purchase process, and in order to purchase MGO, a Purchaser will need to provide an email address
(the “Purchase Email”). The Purchase Email will be used to email the Purchaser a notice of the creation of the
Purchaser’s account on its website. By purchasing MGO, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the
Purchaser agrees not to hold any of the MobileGo Foundation Parties liable for any losses or any special, incidental,
or consequential damages arising out of, or in any way connected to, Purchaser’s failure to secure their account.
10. MGO Will Only Be Available For Sale on the MobileGo Website
MobileGo Foundation will only sell MGO through the MobileGo website, available at https://mobilego.io. To the
extent that any third-party website or service offers MGO for sale during the initial sale or facilitates the sale or
transfer of MGO in any way during the initial sale, such third-party websites or services are not sanctioned by
MobileGo Foundation or its affiliates and have no relationship in any way with the MobileGo Foundation Parties.
As a result, MobileGo Foundation prohibits the use of these third-party websites or services for the purchase of
MGO prior to the end of the initial sale.
11. Fraudulent Attempts to Double Spend BTC
MobileGo Foundation will monitor all potential transactions for fraudulent attempts to double spend BTC. Any
detected double spend of BTC will result in no MGO being delivered to the associated Purchaser.
12. MobileGo Foundation Will Not Purchase MGO During Initial Sale
MobileGo Foundation warrants that it will not purchase MGO in its own sale. Furthermore MobileGo Foundation
warrants that it will not purchase MGO from any third party, or acquire MGO in any manner, or acquire future
control of MGO, during the period of the initial sale.
13. Certain Risks Associated with the Purchase of MGO

The purchase of MGO carries with it significant risk. Prior to purchasing MGO, the Purchaser should carefully
consider the below risks and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professionals prior to
determining whether to purchase MGO.
i.It is possible that the value of BTC will drop significantly in the future, depriving MobileGo Foundation of
sufficient resources to continue to operate.
ii.MGO will be stored in a wallet, which can only be accessed with a password selected by the Purchaser. If a
Purchaser of MGO does not maintain an accurate record of their password, this may lead to the loss of
MGO. As a result, Purchasers must safely store their password in one or more backup locations that are
well separated from the primary location. In order to access one’s MGO the password that the Purchaser
entered is required; loss of this may lead to the loss of a Purchaser’s MGO.
iii.Any third party that gains access to the Purchaser’s Purchase Email may be able to gain access to the
Purchaser’s MGO. The Purchaser must take care not to respond to any inquiry regarding their purchase of
MGO, including but not limited to, email requests purportedly coming from the mobilego.io website or a
similar-looking domain.
iv.Cryptocurrencies have been the subject of regulatory scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the globe.
The GameCredits Mobile Platform and MobileGo Foundation could be impacted by one or more regulatory
enquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit the ability of GameCredits Inc to continue to
develop the GameCredits Mobile Platform.
v.It is possible that the GameCredits Mobile Platform will not be used by a large number of external businesses,
individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the use of peer-to-peer
currencies for gaming. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the GameCredits Mobile
Platform. MobileGo Foundation cannot predict the success of its own marketing efforts or the efforts of
other third parties. There is no guarantee of revenues or profits resulting from the marketing activities of the
MobileGo Foundation.
vi.The Purchaser recognizes that the GameCredits Mobile Platform is currently under development and may
undergo significant changes before release. The Purchaser acknowledges that any expectations regarding
the form and functionality of the GameCredits Mobile Platform held by the Purchaser may not be met upon
release of the GameCredits Mobile Platform, for any number of reasons including a change in the design
and implementation plans and execution of the implementation of the GameCredits Mobile Platform.
vii.The Purchaser understands that while the GameCredits Inc Team will make reasonable efforts to complete
the GameCredits MobileGo Platform software, it is possible that an official completed version of the
GameCredits Mobile Platform may not be released and there may never be an operational GameCredits
Mobile Platform.
viii.Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to steal the BTC and cryptocurrency revenue from the
initial sale, thus potentially impacting the ability of MobileGo Foundation to promote the GameCredits
Mobile Platform. To account for this risk, MobileGo Foundation has and will continue to implement
comprehensive security precautions to safeguard the BTC and cryptocurrency obtained from the sale of
MGO. Multi-factor security measures will be taken to protect cryptocurrency and MGO including but not
limited to physical elements, multi-signature keys, splitting of funds, hot/cold wallet partitioning and
diversification. Moreover, regular security audits of hot and cold wallets will be conducted by internal and
external teams.

ix.Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could
present risks to cryptocurrencies and the GameCredits Mobile Platform, which could result in the theft or
loss of MGO or GAME. To the extent possible, GameCredits Inc intends to update the protocol underlying
the GameCredits Mobile Platform to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate
additional security measures, but cannot it cannot predict the future of cryptography or the success of any
future security updates.
x.As with other cryptocurrencies, the gamecredits blockchain used for the GameCredits Mobile Platform is
susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power
attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the
GameCredits Mobile Platform and expected proper payment operations.
xi.The loss or destruction of a private key by MobileGo Foundation used to access may be irreversible.
MobileGo Foundation’s loss of access to its private keys or a data loss relating to MobileGo Foundation
could adversely affect the value of GameCredits Mobile Platform.
xii.GameCredits Mobile Platform is a new product, thus contributing to price volatility that could adversely
affect the value of MGO. The factors affecting the further development of the digital assets industry, as well
as the GameCredits Mobile Platform, include:
a)

continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of MGO and other digital assets;

b) government and quasi-government regulation of MGO and other digital assets and their use, or
restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of the GameCredits Mobile Platform or similar
digital asset systems;
c)

the maintenance and development of the software of the GameCredits Mobile Platform;

d) changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;
e)

the availability and popularity of other similar products; and

f)

general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to the GameCredits Mobile
Platform and digital assets.

xiii.Intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the operation of the GameCredits Mobile Platform.
Third parties may assert intellectual property claims relating to the holding and transfer of digital assets and
their source code. Regardless of the merit of any intellectual property or other legal action, any threatened
action that reduces confidence in the GameCredits Mobile Platform’s long-term viability or the ability of
end-users to hold and transfer GAME may adversely affect the value of MGO. Additionally, a meritorious
intellectual property claim could prevent end-users from accessing the GameCredits Mobile Platform or
holding or transferring their GAME.
xiv.Cryptocurrency exchanges on which MGO may trade may be relatively new and largely unregulated and
may therefore be more exposed to fraud and failure than established, regulated exchanges for other
products. To the extent that the cryptocurrency exchanges representing a substantial portion of the volume
in MGO trading are involved in fraud or experience security failures or other operational issues, such
cryptocurrency exchange failures may result in a reduction in the price and can adversely affect the value of
MGO. A lack of stability in the cryptocurrency exchanges and the closure or temporary shutdown of
cryptocurrency exchanges due to fraud, business failure, hackers or malware, or government-mandated
regulation may reduce confidence in the GameCredits Mobile Platform and result in greater volatility in the
price.

xv.Political or economic crises may motivate large-scale sales of MGO, which could result in a reduction in the
price and adversely affect the value of MGO. Digital assets such as MGO, which are relatively new, are
subject to supply and demand forces based upon the desirability of an alternative, decentralized means of
transacting, and it is unclear how such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events. Largescale sales of MGO would result in a reduction in the price.
xvi.It is possible that a digital asset other than MGO could have features that make it more desirable to a
material portion of the digital asset user base, resulting in a reduction in demand for MGO, which could
have a negative impact on the use and price of MGO. It is possible that a comparable product could become
materially popular due to either a perceived or exposed shortcoming of the GameCredits Mobile Platform
that is not immediately addressed by the GameCredits Inc Team, or a perceived advantage of a comparable
product that includes features not incorporated into the GameCredits Mobile Platform. If this product
obtains significant market share, it could have a negative impact on the demand for, and price of, MGO.
xvii.MGO transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred MGO may be irretrievable. As a
result, any incorrectly executed MGO transactions could adversely affect the value of MGO.
Cryptocurrency transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and
active participation of the recipient of the transaction or, in theory, control or consent of a majority of the
processing power on the host blockchain platform. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a
block that is added to the blockchain, an incorrect transfer of MGO or a theft of MGO generally will not be
reversible and there may be no compensation for any such transfer or theft. Such loss could adversely affect
the value of MGO.
xviii.Some MGO tokens may be issued on the Ethereum blockchain. As such, any malfunction or unexpected
functioning of the Ethereum protocol may impact the Purchaser’s ability to transfer or securely hold MGO.
Such impact could adversely affect the value of MGO.
xix.Some MGO tokens may be issued on the Waves platform. As such, any malfunction or unexpected
functioning of the Waves platform may impact the Purchaser’s ability to transfer or securely hold MGO.
Such impact could adversely affect the value of MGO.
xx.It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including without limitation the failure of business
relationships or marketing strategies, that the GameCredits Mobile Platform and all subsequent marketing
from the money raised from the same of MGO may fail to achieve success.
14. All Purchases of MGO Are Non-Refundable
ALL PURCHASES OF MGO ARE FINAL. PURCHASES OF MGO ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. BY
PURCHASING MGO, THE PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NEITHER MOBILEGO FOUNDATION
NOR ANY OTHER OF THE MOBILEGO FOUNDATION PARTIES ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A
REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT THE PURCHASER WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER
COMPENSATION FOR ANY MGO THAT IS NOT USED OR REMAINS UNUSED.
15. Taxation of MGO and Taxation Related to the Initial Sale
MobileGo Foundation makes no representations concerning the tax implications of the sale of MGO or the
possession or use of MGO. The Purchaser bears the sole responsibility to determine if the purchase of MGO with
BTC or the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of MGO over time has tax implications for the

Purchaser in the Purchaser’s home jurisdiction. By purchasing MGO, and to the extent permitted by law, the
Purchaser agrees not to hold any of the MobileGo Foundation Parties liable for any tax liability associated with or
arising from the purchase of MGO.
16. Privacy
Although MobileGo Foundation requires that Purchasers provide an email address, MobileGo Foundation will not
publish any identifying information related to MGO purchases, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser.
Purchasers may be contacted by email by MobileGo Foundation regarding a purchase. Such emails will be
informational only. MobileGo Foundation will not request any information from Purchasers in an email.
17. Disclaimer of Warranties
THE PURCHASER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT THE PURCHASER IS PURCHASING MGO AT THE
PURCHASER’S SOLE RISK AND THAT MGO IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EXCEPT ONLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW
WITH ANY LEGALLY REQUIRED WARRANTY PERIOD TO THE SHORTER OF THIRTY DAYS FROM
FIRST USE OR THE MINIMUM PERIOD REQUIRED). WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF
THE MOBILEGO FOUNDATION PARTIES WARRANT THAT THE PROCESS FOR PURCHASING MGO
WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.
18. Limitations Waiver of Liability
THE PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
ANY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED HEREIN APPLY TO ANY AND
ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY WHATSOEVER CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO USE OF, OR INABILITY TO
USE, MGO OR THE GAMECREDITS MOBILE PLATFORM UNDER ANY CAUSE OR ACTION
WHATSOEVER OF ANY KIND IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS
FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) AND
THAT NONE OF THE MOBILEGO FOUNDATION PARTIES SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF
PROFITS, GOODWILL OR DATA, IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR
INABILITY TO USE, OR PURCHASE OF, OR INABILITY TO PURCHASE, MGO. THE PURCHASER
FURTHER SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MOBILEGO FOUNDATION PARTIES ARE NOT
LIABLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER PURCHASERS OF MGO, AND
THAT THE RISK OF PURCHASING MGO RESTS ENTIRELY WITH THE PURCHASER. TO THE EXTENT
PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ANY OF THE
MOBILEGO FOUNDATION PARTIES BE LIABLE TO ANY PURCHASER FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT
THE PURCHASER MAY HAVE PAID TO MOBILEGO FOUNDATION FOR THE PURCHASE OF MGO.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE
LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES. THEREFORE, SOME
OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION AND ELSEWHERE IN THE TERMS MAY NOT APPLY

TO A PURCHASER. IN PARTICULAR, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS SHALL AFFECT THE STATUTORY
RIGHTS OF ANY PURCHASER OR EXCLUDE INJURY ARISING FROM ANY WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR
FRAUD OF MOBILEGO FOUNDATION.
19. Dispute Resolution
a)

MobileGo Foundation and Purchaser (the “Parties”) agree to make good faith efforts to resolve any dispute,
controversy or claim arising between them relating to this pre-sale and their respective rights and
obligations hereunder arising under this Agreement (a “Dispute”).

b) If the Parties, or their designated representatives, are unable to resolve the Dispute within ten (10) business
days after referral of the matter to them, the Parties will submit the Dispute for resolution pursuant to
paragraph c. of this Section.
c)

Except with respect to Disputes concerning (i) the right of either Party to apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for an interim or interlocutory injunction or other provisional remedy to preserve the status quo
or prevent irreparable harm or (ii) any Disputes that may arise in connection with a breach of a Party’s
obligations of confidentiality hereunder, if any Dispute is not resolved pursuant to paragraphs a. and b.
above, the Parties will, acting reasonably, agree mutually on the forum for resolution of the Dispute by
arbitration as set out in this Section.

d) After the completion of the procedures set forth in paragraph b. and agreement by the Parties to enter into
binding arbitration in accordance with paragraph c. of this Section, either Party may within thirty (30)
calendar days refer the Dispute to arbitration by serving written notice of its intention to arbitrate the
Dispute to the other Party.
e)

The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator to be mutually agreed to by the Parties within three
(3) business days following the date of the referral of the Dispute to arbitration.

20. Force Majeure
MobileGo Foundation is not liable for failure to perform solely caused by:
•

unavoidable casualty,

•

delays in delivery of materials,

•

embargoes,

•

government orders,

•

acts of civil or military authorities,

•

acts by common carriers,

•

emergency conditions (including weather conditions), or

•

any similar unforeseen event that renders performance commercially implausible.

If an event of force majeure occurs, the party injured by the other’s inability to perform may elect to suspend the
Agreement, in whole or part, for the duration of the force majeure circumstances. The party experiencing the force
majeure circumstances shall cooperate with and assist the injured party in all reasonable ways to minimize the
impact of force majeure on the injured party.
21. Complete Agreement

These Terms set forth the entire understanding between each Purchaser and MobileGo Foundation with respect to
the purchase and sale of MGO. For facts relating to the sale and purchase, the Purchaser agrees to rely only on this
document in determining purchase decisions and understands that this document governs the sale of MGO and
supersedes any public statements about the initial sale made by third parties or by MobileGo Foundation or
individuals associated with any MobileGo Foundation parties, past and present and during the initial sale. There are
no warranties, representations, covenants, or agreements, express or implied, between the parties except those
expressly set forth in this Agreement. This Agreement may only be amended by a written document duly executed

MONACO CARD
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.1. Core Features
The functionality of Monaco Card makes it a must-have item not only for every Ether or
Bitcoin holder, but also for everyone who spends money in foreign currency.
Core features:
•
Spend your Ether or Bitcoin with a physical Monaco VISA® Card, wherever VISA® cards are
accepted, both online & offline
•

Only the exact amount that you spend with your Monaco Card will be incrementally
exchanged from ETH/BTC in real-time when you swipe your card, with rest being securely
stored in your wallet to which only you have access

•

Exchange money at perfect interbank exchange rates using Monaco App

•

Enjoy the same perfect interbank rates whenever you spend on Monaco Card

•

Send money from Monaco App in 23 currencies to 120 countries worldwide for free

•

Sending money between Monaco App users is free & real-time, with the money being
instantly available for the recipient on their Monaco Card

•

Customer onboarding can be done entirely via the mobile App – a process taking less than 3
minutes

1

1.2. The Monaco Card
In order to receive the Monaco VISA® Card, our customers need to download Monaco Android / iOS
App and go through a simple 3 min onboarding process, including remote KYC. We will issue and
send the Monaco Cards to customers free of charge. The physical card can be used both for online
and offline purchases at more than 30m merchants who accept VISA® globally.
Every time you spend with the Monaco Card, you will be given perfect interbank exchange rates
without markups or fees. In practice that means savings of EUR30-40 on every EUR500 spent,
compared to high street banks.
You can fund your account with Ether and Bitcoin, instantly and for free. You can also use fiat
currencies, topping up your account by bank transfer or with a debit/credit card. Finally, you can also
apply for a credit limit from our App and receive a decision within 48 hours. A top-up credit limit
effectively turns the Monaco Debit Card into a credit card, as you will only pay interest on amounts
of credit that you use, but don’t repay in a timely fashion.
Spending your ETH/BTC with Monaco Card is seamless. You keep ETH/BTC balances in your
wallet, which you can view at any time in the Monaco App. Every time you swipe your Monaco Card,
we will only exchange the incremental amount of ETH/BTC that is required to settle the fiat
currency transaction with VISA®. The rest of your ETH/BTC balances remain in your wallet. There
are no monthly or annual fees for usage of the Monaco Card. Access to perfect inter-bank exchange
is free. Monaco will not charge fees for global ATM withdrawals within Fair Usage Limits. There is a
1% fee for all transactions (swipe and exchange) of ETH/BTC. These earnings will accrue in the
MCO Smart Contract, the rights to which will be held by community members who hold MCO
tokens.

1.2.1.

ETH-funded Purchase with Monaco Card Example

Jenny is a using Monaco Card for her travel expenses. She tops-up her Monaco account with 1
ETH. She is in France on holidays and spends EUR 16 on lunch. She swipes the Monaco Card.
Monaco Card’s server-side processing systems apply perfect interbank exchange rates to calculate
that EUR 16 equals USD 17.7410. Based on the current exchange rate between USD and ETH,
provided by the highest daily volume exchange, USD 17.7410 is equal to ETH 0.19068368.
Monaco will pass on the best-available exchange rate between USD & ETH to the users without any
mark-up.
Monaco will cover the cost of USD & ETH exchange rate (the maker/taker fees traditionally charged
by cryptocurrency exchanges).
No fees are applied for exchange between USD & EUR. Users will receive the perfect interbank
exchange rate without any mark-up.

This is absolutely the most cost-efficient way to
spend ETH in the world, avoiding all the bank fees!

The only fee that is applied is a 1% software license fee that accrues to the MCO Asset Contract
described in section 1.5. In this case, ETH 0.001906837 will be automatically credited to MCO Asset
Contract, increasing the value backing MCO tokens.
Since fees are paid in the token transacted in, the most popular tokens used for transacting will
accumulate to the distribution contract, helping back the value of MCO.

3

1.2.2.

BTC-funded Purchase with Monaco Card Example

The scenario works exactly as with an ETH-funded purchase described above, the only difference
being the Asset Contract accrual of a 1% software license fee. BTC equivalent will be converted to
ETH at prevailing rates without any exchange fees and credited to the MCO Asset Contract.
Monaco will cover the cost of BTC & ETH exchange (the maker/taker fees traditionally charged by
cryptocurrency exchanges).
Monaco will pass on the best-available exchange rate between BTC & ETH without any mark-up.

4

1.3. MCO Token Creation
The Monaco MCO Token Creation Event will last for
30 days, starting 9:30am UCT on 18th of May 2017.
A ﬁxed number will be created during the sale, and no
more will be created thereafter.

1.4. MCO Asset Contract
MCO Asset Contract accrues a 1% licensing fee on
transactions using the Monaco Card funded with
ETH/BTC, as well as exchange transactions between
ETH/BTC and fiat currencies. Over time MCO will be
backed by a portfolio of the most popular ERC20
tokens. MCO holders will be able to access the
portfolio through a mechanism called “REDEEM &
BURN” (see 1.6).
Fees from card swipes will be denominated in the
token being used to fund the swipe (ETH or BTC at
launch). These fees will be sent directly to the MCO
Asset Contract. Over time, this contract will accrue
tokens in proportion to the usage of the Monaco Card
& App globally.

1.5. Support for other ERC20
currencies
Other broadly accepted cryptocurrencies will be
added to the platform over time as they gain
popularity and in consultation with the community.
The current assumption, in order to maximize potential of the MCO Asset Contract, is to set the integration threshold at a currency-in-circulation market cap
of US$500mm.

5

1.6. MCO Token Redeem and Burn
At any time, a holder of MCO can “Redeem and Burn” the
MCO for their pro-rata share of each token held by the
MCO Asset Contract. The holder will irrevocably destroy
the MCO, and in exchange, the MCO Asset Contract will
transfer the underlying tokens to the holder.
MCO token will have a market value at or above the
assets contained in the MCO Asset Contract. If the value
goes below, market participants will be incentivized to
purchase MCO and burn it; this will then push the value of
MCO back up.

•

Definitions:
There are MCOT MCO issued.
There are MCOh units of MCO held by a certain
holder of MCO.
There are m distinct tokens held in the MCO
Asset Contract.
The MCO Asset Contract holds Tm tokens for
the m th token contract.
Then the holder of MCO will receive the
following vector of tokens upon calling the burn
function and choosing to “Redeem and Burn”:

•

Received:

[T1, T2, . . ,Tm ]

MCOh
MCOT

6

1.6.1. Redeem and Burn Example
An MCO holder has 500MCO, the current MCO supply is
10,000MCO. The MCO Asset Contract holds 1,000ETH.
Their claim equals:

[1,000 ETH]

500
10,000

If he burns his MCO, they will receive:

500
= 5. 00%
10,000
Of the held tokens, giving them:

50ETH
After ‘burning’ his MCO, the remaining supply of MCO will now equal:

10,000 − 500 = 9,500
This means that remaining MCO holders will have a higher claim per MCO on the underlying assets
than before the burn. A separate MCO holder who also held 500 MCO will now have a claim on the
assets equal to:

500
= 5. 26%
9,500
Since users can always cash out, we expect the value of MCO should be at least the value of the
underlying tokens.
Consequently, MCO will typically be worth more than the underlying tokens, because a user who
cashes out abandons future fees. By cashing out, the user distributes the present value of future
dividends to the other MCO holders. Therefore, users will not normally cash out!

7

2.
THE MCO TOKEN CREATION
Monaco Card aims to accept up to 150,000ETH from our initial token partners and create approximately 17.6m MCO for sale in exchange for the ETH committed.
The MCO smart contract will stop accepting commitments at 888,888ETH hard cap.
The Token Sale will last for 30 days. If soft-cap is reached, the event will be extended for 7 days and
then closed. If hard-cap is reached, the event will close automatically.

2.1. The Monaco BLACK Card
Limited Edition Monaco VISA® BLACK Card will be issued to first 999 customers. Each of the cards
will have a unique number engraved from 001 to 999 accompanied by the words “Founding
Member”.
The priority of the numbers will be decided after the MCO Token Creation Event, according to the
following rules:
•

001-499 – will be assigned to the top ETH token contributors upon completion of MCO
Token Creation Event

•

500-999 – will be assigned to the fastest contributors, based on time stamp of their ETH
contribution

There will be no Monaco BLACK Cards issued after the initial 999.
The BLACK Card Leaderboard will be available and updating automatically in real-time during MCO
Token Event.
Besides the exclusive design, Monaco BLACK Card holders will enjoy lifetime unlimited perfect
interbank exchange rates and triple free monthly ATM withdrawal limits. More benefits will be rolled
out over time.
The person who contributes the highest number of tokens in the ICO will be rewarded with Monaco
BLACK Card Number 001 and will receive a bonus 188,888 MCO Tokens from the Monaco
Founder's Pool. The 188,888 Bonus MCO Tokens will not be subject to a lockup period.

9

2.2 . Use of Funds
The proceeds from the token sale will fund the product launch, continued platform development and
user acquisition:
•

35% – R&D and Product Development
Includes opening of an R&D center in Shenzhen with approximately 20-30 engineers.

•

20% – Marketing and Customer Acquisition
The marketing budget is not significant compared to the target number of customers we
intend to acquire. The key source of new customers is going to be word-of-mouth, as the
product gives users a very strong commercial incentive to download the App and get the
Monaco Card. There are natural network effects built into the product around the P2P money
sending function, which will lower the average customer acquisition cost (CAC) substantially.

•

15% – Initial Capex, including costs of e-Money licenses, compliance and architecture setup
Some of our key partners are listed in section 4 of the document. There is a substantial cost
associated with integrating all those partners, acquiring all the necessary licenses across
multiple jurisdictions, building out compliance teams, legal fees and general technical
architecture setup.

•

30% – Working Capital
Our product – the first and only Universal Money App - is bridging the gap between the
worlds of crypto and fiat currencies. In order to offer our users real-time access to funds and
perfect exchange rates without mark-up, we will have to bridge funding gaps between
multiple parties using our own balance sheet.

2.3. TokenMarket Escrow
Funds committed during the MCO Token Creation Even will be held in a secure multi-signature wallet
and will only be released from the account with 2 out of 3 signatures:
•
•
•

Kris Marszalek – Founder @ Foris
Mikko Ohtamaa – CTO @ TokenMarket
Timothy Hitchens – Head of Solution Architects, Worldwide Public Sector - APJ at
Amazon Web Services

10

2.4. Reserve Tokens
We are setting aside 30% of all MCO created as Reserve Tokens.
These MCO will not be issued or sold during the initial sale and are locked in a smart contract. If at
some point it seems advisable for the Monaco Card project to sell more tokens, some or all of these
may be offered in an auction format or some other format that suits the capital needs of the project.
Specifically, there are substantial balance sheet strength requirements in case Monaco decides to
apply for a full banking license in the European Union or Asia. In the interim, these MCO will not be
used in any way. They will not be considered as issued for Redeem and Burn calculations.
It is possible these MCO will never be issued, however, we feel it is prudent to have some backup if
needed. In any event, Monaco will engage directly with MCO holders to seek guidance and market
reaction before any of the Reserve tokens are offered.

5.
THE MARKET
Fundamentally, there are two broad group of customers for whom Monaco Card has been built

•
Cryptocurrency holders, who want to spend it globally in the most convenient and efficient
manner
•
Fiat-only customers, who spend in foreign currency and are now facing excessive levels of
fees charged by banks
While the funding sources for Monaco Card will differ for both customer groups, their use cases
largely overlap and include:
1.

Outbound travel spend

IPK International reported that the world outbound travel market turnover for the full year 2016
topped the $2 trillion mark for the first time, which was an increase of around 7 to 8% compared to
2015. The outlook for travel in 2017 is very positive, according to IPK International. The consultancy
forecasts an increase in worldwide outbound trips of between 4 and 5%. IPK International sees
particularly strong growth for outbound trips from Asia, with a likely rise of 6%.
China’s outbound tourism is a massive opportunity. Over 70% of cross-border trips are made to
Hong Kong and Macau, according to the World Travel Monitor. Chinese outbound trips amounted to
around 39 million in 2015, excluding trips to Hong Kong and Macao. For the Chinese traveler holding
digital currencies, the Monaco App can be an essential tool.
2.

In-bound remittance (sending money back home)

A remittance is - quite simply - a money transfer made by a foreign worker back to an individual in
their home country. However, the typical international money transfer requires loads of communication between the individuals on either end of it. They have to calculate exchange rates, synchronize
amounts, collect personal details, agree on a transfer method, and then confirm when the cash has
been sent and received. Worldwide, 230 million people send $500 billion in remittances each year,
primarily using firms like Western Union, Moneygram, and RIA.
India, China and the Philippines are the top three countries that receive the most money via remittances. In terms of continents, Asia is the biggest recipient by far - in 2016, migrants from China and
India sent home a staggering $180 billion.

Cross-border online shopping in foreign currency

The global B2C cross-border e-commerce market will balloon in size to $1 trillion in 2020 from $230
billion in 2014, according to a report from global consulting firm Accenture and AliResearch, Alibaba
Group’s research arm. In the report, researchers forecast that this increasingly popular form of
online shopping—entailing consumers taking to the Internet to buy products directly from overseas
retailers—will see compound annual growth of 27.4 percent per year. By 2020, more than 900 million
people around the world will be international online shoppers, the report says, with their purchases
accounting for nearly 30 percent of all global B2C transactions.
China will become the largest cross-border B2C market by 2020, with the transaction volume of
imported goods purchased online reaching $245 billion, according to Accenture-AliResearch. The
report predicts over 200 million Chinese consumers will be cross-border shopping by 2020.
Monaco Card can address those markets directly and globally .

FINANCIALS
We have a short operating history and a new business model, which makes it difficult to evaluate
with accuracy our prospects and future financial results. Despite the risks and uncertainties
frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets, we are offering two scenarios to
help those participating in the Token Creation Event to understand different levers and possible
outcomes for the project.
Monaco’s revenue comes from the fee charged to the merchants by VISA® (interchange fee, see
below). This fee is the same as on other cards and is paid by merchants to VISA® in order to
process their payments. Monaco takes a percentage of this fee each time a customer uses their
Monaco Card. We assumed in our models the average interchange fee to be around 1.20%. This is
not straightforward, there are pages and pages of rates: the interchange fees vary based on
whether the card was present or not – and on the type of good or service being bought, whether it
was a debit or credit card, whether it was a corporate card, whether it was an international
transaction and lots of other criteria.
Monaco intends to add additional recurring revenue streams within the next 12-18 months, including subscription fees based on a fair usage policy (i.e.: for cash withdrawals) and introduction of
credit line with repayment period between 12 and 60 months.
Additionally, we will partner with innovative fintech companies around the world to provide customers with the best savings, investments, credit, and insurance products directly with our App. We
intend to be a digital finance platform and share revenues with selected “best of” partners in other
major categories (investing, savings, credit & loans, insurance) with an emphasis on blockchain
empowered partners.
Conservatively, we have based our average user spend on debit card reports that give an average
spend of USD3,500 per year.
Licensing fees are calculated simply as 1% of transaction volume.
We have also taken into account growth in users transacting in ERC20 tokens versus fiat currency.
We will grow progressively the percentage of ERC20 tokens transactions from 40% to 80% over 5
years.

23

Financial transactions include POS and ATM transactions.
Since January 2017, Ethereum and the Token market have grown at a value-weighted average of
about 300,000% annually (or 6.7x per three months). We do not believe this growth rate will continue
over the next five years. We have therefore taken a range of growth from 40% to 100% per year as
our range for projections. For each scenario, we also assume that the Ethereum economy grows by around 3% (Conservative) and 6% (Optimistic) monthly for the next 5 years. This equates to
around a 40% and 100% annual growth in assets backing MCO for the different scenarios respectively.
Below are some rough projections of Monaco performance under two different scenarios over a 5
year period.

7.1. Conservative
In a conservative scenario, we modestly grow our user base and modestly monetize our products.
We will operate in a highly competitive space. However, we strengthen our position as the multi-currency platform of choice in the Ethereum community by adding product features valued by the
community. We foresee only a modest increase to the rate at which the general public funds
payments using digital currencies. and tokens begin to see adoption by the general public, which
also boosts our user-base.

Numeraire: A Cryptographic Token for Coordinating Machine
Intelligence and Preventing Overfitting
Richard Craib, Geo↵rey Bradway, Xander Dunn
with Joey Krug

https://numer.ai
February 20, 2017

Abstract
Machine learning competitions are susceptible to intentional overfitting. Numerai
proposes Numeraire, a new cryptographic token that can be used in a novel auction
mechanism to make overfitting economically irrational. The auction mechanism
leads to equilibrium bidding behavior that reveals rational data scientists’ confidence in their models’ ability to perform well on new data. The auction mechanism
also yields natural arguments for the economic value of a Numeraire token.

1

Motivation

A common approach to verify accuracy in machine learning is to break the dataset into train and test sets.
A trained model can be tested for accuracy on the test set, which it has never seen. However, to maintain
statistical validity, this test set should only be used once. When a data scientist accesses the test set multiple
times and uses that score as feedback for model selection, there’s a risk of training a model that overfits the
test set. This hurts the model’s ability to perform well on new data.

Figure 1:

An overfitting curve

where the test error continues to
decrease with more submissions
from data scientists, but the error
on new data increases. [2]
This overfitting problem is called adaptive data analysis [3]. Models resulting from adaptive data analysis
1

range from slightly degraded to completely useless [4]. For Numerai, adaptive data analysis occurs when
data scientists’ models have overfit historical data, at the cost of live performance. In a machine learning
competition there is incentive to overfit to the historical data because performance on that data dictates
winnings. Overfitting becomes intentional. What Numerai really needs is not a collection of great backtests
that work well on historical data, but a collection of great models that work well on new data.
Currently, the state of the art solution to holdout reuse is to limit the amount of information exposed
when using the holdout set [1]. While sufficent for scientific discovery, this solution heavily degrades user
experience and rankings in machine learning tournaments.
We propose a new system for data scientists to communicate their beliefs about the quality of their models.
Data scientists will compete in the new tournament by staking a new crypto-token, Numeraire (NMR), on
their predictions. The auction mechanism for resolving these stakes will reward correct predictions of a
model’s ability to perform well on new data. With Numeraire, data scientists will now be able to express
their confidence in their models’ live performance. Their expressions of confidence help us to emphasize the
right models and improve the performance of our hedge fund.

2

Cryptographic Tokens

Numeraire is an ERC20 Ethereum token [6]. Ethereum tokens are represented as smart contracts that are
executed on the Ethereum blockchain. The source code to Numeraire’s smart contract is publicly available1 .
All minted Numeraire are sent to Numerai. The Ethereum smart contract dictates there will never be
more than 21 million Numeraire minted. Numerai will send 1 million Numeraire to data scientists based on
their historical ranking on Numerai’s leaderboard. After the initial distribution, the smart contract will mint
a fixed number of Numeraire each week until the maximum is reached. By performing well in Numerai’s
machine learning competition, data scientists will earn Numeraire on an ongoing basis.
When data scientists are confident of the predictions they have made, they send Numeraire to the
Numeraire Ethereum smart contract. The receiving contract will hold the data scientists’ Numeraire for some
holding period t, with t sufficiently large to judge performance on new data. After t has passed, Numerai will
send a message to the contract with information on which data scientists’ predictions performed well on new
data. Those data scientists whose predictions performed well earn dollars based on the auction mechanism,
and their Numeraire are returned. Those data scientists whose predictions did not perform well on new
data risk having their Numeraire destroyed. The irreversible destruction of these Numeraire will be publicly
verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain.

Auction

3.1

Overview

Every tournament has a staking prize pool, which is some fixed number of dollars. The auction mechanism
allocates the prize pool among data scientists. Data scientists can submit bids to the auction. Bids are
tuples (c, s) where c is confidence defined as the number of Numeraire the data scientist is willing to stake to
win 1 dollar, and s is the amount of Numeraire being staked. For some time t, s is locked in the Ethereum
contract, inaccessible to anyone, including Numerai. After t has passed, a variant on the multiunit Dutch
auction is used to determine the payouts.

3.2

Auction Mechanism

The auction mechanism is a multiunit Dutch auction with some additional rules. Performance is evaluated
after time t. The performance evaluation metric is logloss2 , a suitable metric for binary classification problems
like Numerai’s machine learning competition. A model is considered to have performed well if logloss
<

ln(0.5), and badly if logloss

ln(0.5). The data scientists are ranked in descending order of confidence

c. In descending order of confidence until the prize pool is depleted, data scientists are awarded s/c dollars
if their models performed well or they lose stake s if they perform badly. Once the prize pool is depleted,
data scientists no longer earn dollars or lose their stakes.

3.3

Example

Assume a prize pool of 3000 dollars, and that time t has elapsed. Assume the staking auction ended as
follows:

Numeraire are destroyed. ABRIOSI receives $500, $100 less than his bid because the prize pool is exhausted.
Everyone below ABRIOSI will have the Numeraire returned and receive zero dollars.

Analysis of Staking

Let p be the probability that the model achieves logloss <

ln(0.5) on new, unseen data. A low p would

imply a high probability that a model is overfit. Let s be a data scientist’s total Numeraire staked. Let e be
the exchange rate of Numeraire per dollar. c is the confidence. A data scientist will stake Numeraire if the
expected value of staking Numeraire is positive. If a data scientist stakes s and achieves logloss
ln(0.5),
s
the data scientist loses e dollars. If a data scientist stakes s and achieves logloss < ln(0.5), the data
s
scientist wins c dollars. Therefore, the expected value in dollars of staking s with confidence c is
E(c, s) = p

s
c

(1

p)

s
e

A data scientist will stake if
E(c, s)
p

s
c

(1

0
p)

s
e

0

This implies
p

c
c+e

This results in self-revelation: Data scientists are moved to reveal their true inner values. Solely in the
interest of maximizing winnings, data scientists reveal their knowledge of their models’ abilities to generalize
to new, unseen data. As we let these tournaments repeat, we expect to see bidding behaviors that accurately
reflect p, since overbidding and underbidding are both nonoptimal behaviors and the accuracy of estimating
p increases with time.
Since having a higher confidence produces greater incentive to participate in an auction, we can make
the following observations:
• The higher p, the higher c a data scientist will submit, and the more dollars the data
scientist can win from the auction.
• For a fixed p, a confidence that is too high produces E(c, s) < 0, which will deter this
strategy.
• Models that perform well on historical data but fail to generalize (low p) will either
have logloss <

ln(0.5) or have E(c, s) < 0.

• Because Numeraire can be used by data scientists to earn dollars, the exchange rate
e > 0.
• Numeraire is worth more to data scientists with large p because they can use it to earn
dollars with higher confidence.
• A data scientist with p = 1 has an expected value in dollars E(c, s) = sc . To this data
scientist, the value of all Numeraire is the net present value of all future stake payouts
by Numerai.
4

The purpose of this auction is to get accurate probability estimates, not to maximize Numeraire staked.
The auction need not be revenue maximizing, but self-revelation is important. While a weakly dominant
strategy in second priced auctions is to bid truthfully, second priced auctions are more susceptible to collusion
and first priced auctions are more robust to this [5]. For this reason, and for simplicity, we use a Dutch
auction (first priced) rather than an Ausubel auction.

“We’ve entered the most profound era of change for financial services 		
companies since the 1970s brought us index mutual funds, discount 		
brokers and ATMs.”
				
Business Insider 7 July 2016
The cannabis industry has traditionally been fragmented, untrustworthy, and illicit, but
it is now moving towards greater legitimacy. New research shows powerful health
benefits of cannabis and strong social movements are pushing for increased legalization. One way to improve the reputation of the industry is to modernize it, make it
standardized, fully verifiable, and built on a system of trust between patients, doctors,
growers, and suppliers. New blockchain technology / Distributed Ledger Technology(DLT) offers an ideal solution. Since blockchain holds an immutable ledger and assured contracts, it can easily accommodate the recording and storing of all product
life cycle events, verify patient identification, assure payments, and more. Paragon
seeks to create a crypto-token built on smart contracts on blockchain specifically for
the worldwide cannabis community. Paragon is the first organization dedicated to
leveraging smart contracts built on the blockchain to create and foster a community
dedicated to the worldwide legalization and systematization of cannabis.

1. BACKGROUND
The 21st century brings dramatic changes in health, finance, business, and technology. It offers many opportunities to take advantage of changing trends and build on
innovation. In the health field alone, we are witnessing great strides to cure diseases,
manage symptoms, and reduce or eliminate chronic pain. However, one of the most
remarkable methods remains illegal in multiple states and at the federal level in the
United States. Our goal is to change the legal status of cannabis, ensure the benefits
are available globally, and create a framework that brings regulation and verification
to the cannabis industry.
Governments around the world, most particularly the United States government, have
restricted and penalized cannabis users and businesses. Yet, we are seeing developments that push the US federal government to establish, regulate, and encourage
an open and fair market for the use and sale of cannabis. Currently, the $150 billion
cannabis industry struggles with a patchwork of laws and regulations. Because there
has been no standardization of federal regulations to allow for the legal trade of cannabis, it has been forced underground, increasing the suffering of many ill people,
preventing efficient and accurate business practices, adding to the crime rate, and
losing state governments a great deal of potential tax revenue.

Before cannabis can fulfill its health benefit potential, there are a series of problems that need to be overcome:
• Dated prohibition laws that label cannabis with an erroneous classification
• Payment laws that make it nearly impossible to use traditional banking or
credit solutions
• Uneducated politicians guided by obsolete and incorrect information
• Social stigma and public opinion against cannabis
• A patchwork of laws that differ from county to county, state to state, and
country to country
• No established standards for purity, lab testing, ID verification, organic or
eco friendly certifications, prescriptions, THC/CBD potency, start-to-finish
tracking, and so on.
• Poor and inefficient distribution system
• Few places that allow cannabis businesses to rent office space (so-called
“Green Zones”)

2017

New blockchain technology presents a solution to most of these problems. Smart
contracts built on a blockchain erase borders and unite dedicated people throughout the world. These committed advocates can use social platforms to change
laws, stop prosecutions, and ultimately legalize cannabis. Moreover, they can
also build applications that make the industry safe, responsible, and organized
via standardization and tokenization. This passionate focus on one emerging industry can help pool strong talent in this area so as to achieve maximum results.

4

The cannabis industry is in the early stages of transitioning from an illicit to a legal
economy. Of the $53 billion spent on cannabis in 2016 in the United States alone,
only $7 billion was spent through legal channels. Clearly, legalizing the system will
open a floodgate for new businesses.
Now is the ideal time to take advantage of the growth potential of cannabis. Three
converging forces make legalization much more likely:
1. Increased public opinion favors legalization. Look at some past headlines:
a. BRITONS

WANT CANNABIS TO BE LEGALISED –
CHANGE IS INEVITABLE, SAYS EX-MINISTER
- The Guardian1

b. CANNABIS

LEGALISATION: 47% SUPPORT SALE OF
DRUG THROUGH LICENSED SHOPS, POLL REVEALS
- Independent 2

c. SUPPORT

FOR MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION CONTINUES TO RISE
- Pew Research3

It goes on to say 57% of U.S. adults favor marijuana legalization, while only 37%
want it to remain illegal.

2. Numerous medical research4 studies support the effectiveness of cannabis in alleviating multiple autoimmune illness symptoms, neurologi

3. Cannabis has a unique and passionate following. Those with ill health who
are learning about the benefits of cannabis are demanding change. Millions
of others desire easy, legal access to cannabis in all its various forms. When
given a forum to unite them, they will brainstorm effective ways to realize
change. They will network to influence those in power and publish information to change the minds of dissenting voters. By building on this network and
community, legalization of cannabis can happen much more quickly, placing
Paragon in the preeminent position of a global cannabis cryptocurrency.
Paragon plans to create a structure and technology that will solve the issues that
surround the legal cannabis industry. The technology is ready to be used and sets
up Paragon to take advantage of the ever increasing scope of cannabis legalization.

2. MISSION STATEMENT
Paragon seeks to pull the cannabis community from marginalized to mainstream
by building blockchain into every step of the cannabis industry and by working
toward full legalization. Our strength lies in the unique blockchain/cannabis connection that uses smart contracts. We believe in blockchain, and we believe in the
benefits of cannabis. More uses of cannabis are coming to light, and we want to
accelerate that process. We believe cannabis is good for individuals and good for
countries. We are passionate about moving forward in an ethical, morally responsible, and legal way.
Why did we choose the name of Paragon? Because Paragon means “exceptional”
and that is what we aspire to be:
1. We support vital causes: Improved health, reduced criminalization of good people, and the freedom to make our own choices.
2. We support the blockchain community. We will try to use as much PRG tokens
and as little fiat currencies as possible while implementing our ideas.
3. We are standardizing and unifying a fragmented industry. We will build blockchain smart contract solutions for many of the industry’s weaknesses. The industry
needs help with lab testing, supply chain, ID verification, compliance, etc. All these
respond well to smart contracts.
4. We seek to create a physical ecosystem for cannabis and the new cryptocoin.
Our office workspace opens up a critical place for cannabis companies to work and
thrive.
5. We are transparent. Funds will be escrowed and our books will be audited by
reputable companies, such as Deloitte, Grant Thornton, or other well-recognized, international accounting firms experienced with the nascent blockchain industry.
6. The platform is open-source. It can be used by anyone to build their own cannabis smart contract or blockchain application, create their own token crowdsale ,
promote their specific cause, etc.
7. We are responsible. We limit our own benefits, putting the cause first. This is our
passion. We are committed to the legalization efforts and the community.
8. We give our members a voice. Pitch your ideas, help others, get funded, support
other ideas, and decide our future through a voting system.
9. We are groundbreaking. We will take advantage of the media’s interest in the hot
topics of cannabis and cryptocurrencies. We benefit from being a community led
by a female entrepreneur and we are the only strong global movement for cannabis
utilizing the emerging smart contract/blockchain technology.

2017

Paragon’s passion, committed community, strong technology, and experienced
leadership make this cryptocurrency the natural choice for the cannabis industry.

3. PARAGON BUSINESS MODEL
We started Paragon to resolve many issues currently faced by the cannabis industry. Blockchain-built smart contract technology is ideally suited to organize, systematize, and bring verification and stability to a traditionally unchecked industry. Even
before full legalization there are many opportunities for blockchain and crypto-tokens to enhance the cannabis community and business model.
Paragon will use blockchain smart contracts to:
•  Create an immutable ledger for all industry related data via ParagonChain
•   Offer payment for industry related services and supplies through ParagonCoin
•  Establish niche co-working spaces via ParagonSpace
•  Organize and unite global legalization efforts through ParagonOnline
•  Bring standardization of licensing, lab testing, transactions, supply chain
and ID verification through apps built in ParagonAccelerator

The Paragon model starts with a crypto-token and blockchain technology. It then
sets up a network of physical cooperative workspaces where members can work,
meet, socialize, and create. This will resolve issues with leases for cannabis-based
startups and dispensaries that struggle with finding affordable and suitable locations to house their business.
Paragon’s organization also includes online platforms to unite people around the
world who are committed to cannabis legalization. Harnessing and focusing this
dedicated community will quickly strengthen the legalization movement and is expected to positively influence the demand for and respectively value of Paragon’s
cryptocurrency, PRG.
Finally, Paragon will actively support and fund blockchain innovation in the cannabis
field, such that it increases the use and importance of PRG.
Paragon’s business model is both unified and complementary. Each part combines
to improve the whole. We will go into depth with each aspect and discuss what it
does, how it works, and what makes it unique.

3.1 PARAGON SMART CONTRACTS
Using Blockchain Smart Contracts to Innovate
the Cannabis Industry.
Paragon takes advantage of the digital and verifiable nature of blockchain to solve
the fragmentation of the cannabis market and the marginalization of businesses
and consumers. Blockchain smart contracts are ideal for recording and facilitating
the exchange of value, goods, services, and private data. Putting cannabis data and
transactions on blockchain smart contracts will also increase the speed of service
and save companies hundreds of thousands in reduced paperwork.

Blockchain connects all facets of the cannabis industry from start to finish

The PRG smart contracts can immediately serve a number of businesses within the
cannabis industry. With legal changes, increased community regulations and acceptance, other business opportunities may emerge. Blockchain smart contracts can
instantly and accurately register and record these events:
Blockchain based smart contracts provide accountability in a way no other technology can offer.
•  Provides an immutable ledger that offers permanent verification of every
past transaction, so it builds trust
•  Stores all product lifecycle events forever in an easy-to-retrieve system
•  Lets multiple apps simultaneously interact with any piece of information
stored in blockchain
2017

•  Offers anonymous patient identification
•  Facilitates peer-to-peer transactions across the globe
9

The combination of decentralized encryption, anonymity, immutability, and global
scale turns Paragon into the ultimate online community for the legalization of cannabis across borders.
Paragon is built with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is an advanced,
open and completely decentralized application platform. Ethereum uses all the
strengths of Bitcoin’s original technology. Blockchain was first established as a digital currency for use in financial systems, but the second generation blockchain and
its associated smart contract technology can be used for so much more.
Ethereum builds on Bitcoin to offer contracts and other kinds of verified transactions. Paragon adds another layer to Ethereum, letting it focus on solving problems
unique to cannabis growers, dispensaries, labs, doctors, and customers. Paragon
builds on the strength of a well- established system to offer applications, perform
financial services, create a new cryptocurrency, and form a messaging system.
As such, Paragon provides not only the groundbreaking Ethereum based crypto-currency called ParagonCoin (PRG) but also a powerful, modular toolset to build applications that can track shipments, verify potency, identify medical patients and their
prescriptions, and a host of applications not yet imagined. Ethereum gives users
complete freedom to create their own applications on the Paragon platform.

2017

10

Some examples of smart contract/blockchain uses within the cannabis industry include:
•  Blockchain verification of medical marijuana IDs and prescriptions: This
could be an interface for doctors to sign, vendors and government to
verify, with doctors paid in PRG. There could be a small fee for each verification.
•  Supply chain transparency: Track and trace activity logs, transfers, permissions, safety concerns (i.e.,who handles, expiration of perishable
items), and more.
•  Lets multiple apps simultaneously interact with any piece of information
stored in blockchain.
•   Share document via smart contracts: Contracts accompany purchase
orders. As conditions change, rules change, or the availability changes,
so the contract can be automatically adjusted.
•  Facilitates peer-to-peer transactions across the globe.
•  Secure transfer of assets: Record the quantity of assets such as pallets,
trailers, containers, as they move between supply chain nodes.
•  Track purchase orders: Change orders, receipts, shipment notifications,
or other trade-related documents as needed.
•   Assign or verify certifications or certain properties of physical products: For example, determining if a food product is organic or fair trade,
lab-tested pure CBD or pure THC, amounts of the active ingredient, etc.
•  Link physical goods to serial numbers, barcodes, digital tags like RFID,
etc.

3.2 PARAGON COIN
ParagonCoin (PRG) can create a global ecosystem where businesses and consumers can quickly and easily verifiably transfer funds — business to business, business
to consumer, and/or consumer to consumer. A cryptocurrency correctly implemented is the logical solution to an ongoing issue with an unregulated marketplace. It
readily solves the most major impediment to cannabis innovation and growth: the
banking and payments issues.

PRG Distribution and Supply
PRG will be the digital token that powers and incentivizes the Paragon user community and content platform. This digital token can be exchanged for fiat currency
(dollars, euros, yen), in jurisdictions where such exchange is legal, or other cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether) on various cryptocurrency exchanges after the initial
ICO. The projected value is expected to be about USD $1.00 per PRG (fiat currency
price throughout this White Paper is provided for illustrative purposes only; no fiat
currency will be accepted during the PRG token crowdsale, only cryptocurrencies
such as BTC, ETH, LTC IOTA and others).
Name: ParagonCoin
Ticker: PRG
Based on: Ethereum
Technical data:
•   A total of 200,000,000 PRG will be generated. There will be no further
production of tokens so, over time, the tokens in circulation shall reduce
in number and increase in demand.
2017

•   Desktop wallets for Mac OS, Windows, and Linux keep cryptocurrency
safe while allowing for easy transfers, balance viewing, and simple use.
12

•   Tokens are created with an ERC20 token smart contract. The integrity of
the system is built on the self-interest of token owners. Owners of more
tokens may have more say in the Paragon community and the direction
Paragon takes.
•   Fast network speeds with transactions settling in a minute or so.
•   Ethereum backed voting feature: PRG uses blockchain-based voting for
a true democracy.
•   Expanded notary and/or oracle service is possible on Ethereum blockchain with ParagonCoin.
•   Multi-signature accounts can be implemented in just two clicks.
•   Fixed fees make it easy to know your costs. You don’t need to calculate
how much each transaction will cost.
•   Best Application Program Interface (API) and smart contract documentation available on blockchain.
•   User-friendly Graphic User Interface (GUI) makes it easy to go from idea
to implementation without a lot of tech skills or developers needed.

Token distribution is an important part of a token crowdsale. The distributed value
and frequency of token production influence token price. 200,000,000 total tokens
will be generated. These tokens will be introduced in two ways. Token crowdsale
will be conducted as follows.
•   100,000,000 tokens for sale valued at $1.00 USD each at stage 1
•   50,000,000 tokens for sale at stage 2 - no sooner than 2021, at market
price (not the initial $1 of the first crowdsale )
•   40,000,000 tokens allotted for Paragon controlled reserve to maintain
price support of the PRG tokens. Tokens can be bought or sold to keep
the tokens circulation stable
•   10,000,000 tokens community-controlled reserve to be used for the
best startup ideas as voted on by the community

2017

13

Paragon is committed to a fully transparent process even beyond the open source
coding. Here are other ways we will work for transparency and community control.
•   Engage one of the “Big Four” accounting companies for annual third-party
audits.
•  Founders and team members who own PRG will be prohibited from liquidating
that PRG at a rate of more than 20% of their position within the first calendar
year. This is to prevent dumping and to keep a stable token price. It keeps their
interests aligned with the Paragon community.
• Reserved token crowdsale  funds will be inaccessible for any other purpose
than future token crowdsale events. The PRG price of the second and third token crowdsale events will be determined based on, but not limited to, the PRG
exchange price prior to the crowdsale event in question.
•   Community approval will be used via smart contract voting. The voting may
approve coin reserve unlocking, club membership policy changes, and other
changes that affect the Paragon community.
•   A minimal threshold amount will be required for a completed token crowdsale. The token offering will have a series of cap levels. If the token crowdsale
does not reach its minimum cap of 10 million, any funds received during the
token crowdsale will be returned to the original initiating wallets automatically. Assuming the minimum threshold is exceeded, but the maximum cap
of 100 million tokens is not met, any unsold tokens will be burned. Any funds
received after having reached the maximum cap of 100 million tokens will be
automatically returned to the senders’ wallet.
•  Third-party recognized escrow agent will ensure tokens deposited for a token
crowdsale are kept secure until the token crowdsale is finalized and the tokens generated.
•   Each token crowdsale will be designed to reduce the number of large buyers
(whales) who may want to dump tokens. Instead, the token crowdsale   will
favor smaller investors who are committed to the cannabis cause and plan on
participating in the community.

2017

How to Get ParagonCoins
The initial token crowdsale will take place between September 15, 2017 and October
16, 2017, and can be accessed via our website: http://paragoncoin.com. Please register for the token crowdsale so you are notified of the opening of the event. Recent
token crowdsales (also commonly referred to as ICOs) have sold out in minutes. Be
sure to take advantage of notification and prior registration so you do not miss out.
After the initial token crowdsale , opening a coin account with Paragon will be easy
and free using existing Ethereum wallets. Because Paragon is truly decentralized, it
uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority. The network collectively carries out the issuing of ParagonCoins. It works everywhere, anytime, so
business can be transacted 24/7 in any part of the world.
Post-crowdsale , interested people will also be able to purchase and sell PRG on
exchanges, subject to applicable regulations in their country of residence.
All transactions will be secured with state-of-the art cryptography, and the blockchain integrity will be protected by CPU-efficient, ASIC-resistant proof of stake. This
unique model will allow us to speed transactions and satisfy banking needs for cannabis-related businesses. In particular, it will offer cannabis businesses and consumers a legal alternative to the current regulatory restrictions.
Paragon is committed to the cryptocurrency community. We want to keep the value
of PRG strong and growing. We also do not want our token crowdsale to affect the
Bitcoin price. To that end, we will be very careful as we convert the token crowdsale
proceedings to fiat currency to pay for expenses. We will stage the conversion of the
token crowdsale proceeds over time and through multiple cryptocurrencies and exchanges. This will dilute any impact that volume might make on either PRG or other
cryptocurrencies.

3.3 PARAGON SPACE
We are creating a chain of high-tech, fully equipped Paragon centers similar to WeWork®8.
We will put them in areas where cannabis is legal, and there is strong interest in cannabis.
This will give startups easy access to a network of resources to set up, manage, and grow
their business with the help of like-minded individuals. Within the co-working spaces, individuals can receive mentoring, legal and business advice, and access industry information
and best practices. It will facilitate the exchanges of information, education, sales, purchases, and transporting of cannabis.
Our mission is to create a safe physical space where advocates can push to repeal current
regulatory restrictions and present information on the benefits of marijuana use for medical
conditions, recreational use, and general well being.
Our long-term goal is to expand our presence throughout the US, the EMEA (Europe/Middle
East/Africa), and APAC (Asia Pacific) regions. All expansion plans will be carried out in
adherence to local laws and regulations. Over 164 million people use marijuana around the
world. Major markets and producers in the Americas and Europe began with two source
countries — the Netherlands and Canada. They were quickly followed by Germany, Austria,
Italy, Finland, Croatia, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Brazil, and Chile.

Still, the checkerboard of laws and restrictions prohibit cannabis imports or exports
across state, and often national, borders. Thus, it makes sense to establish local, brickand-mortar office spaces and unite the cannabis community one location at a time.

The Need for ParagonSpace
ParagonSpace fulfills an essential need in the cannabis industry. Areas zoned for
cannabis businesses are limited and office space is tight and high priced. Many
landlords will not rent to a cannabis business because they fear legal ramifications.
Furthermore, most cannabis businesses work in isolation. Paragon is creating the
first large-scale cryptocurrency-backed brick-and-mortar project. This may be the
only physical community setting where cannabis ideas can cross pollinate and
members receive encouragement and support.
ParagonSpace supports several of the main goals of the Paragon mission at once.
1. It offers vital physical office space so like-minded people can work and brainstorm.
2. It supports the ParagonCoin tokens by only accepting PRG in payment for access to office space and to purchase office equipment, printing and other services, snacks, and nearly anything else necessary to function in this business
environment. Essentially, it creates a PRG sub-economy.
3. It builds a rock-solid foundation for supporting the value of the currency, making it very attractive to hold and use for the long-term.
4. It solves a real and substantial office space problem in the quickly growing legal
cannabis industry.

2017

17

The lion’s share of the token crowdsale proceeds will be spent on real-estate acquisition.
Think of it as a sort of elite coworking membership where your PRG tokens give you access
to physical space. The more tokens you have, the more space you can rent. These office
spaces will be rented or leased using PRG as the currency of exchange.

How Does ParagonSpace Work?
To get a reserved space at our center, applicants will need to pitch their legalization ideas or
cannabis startup ideas to our community. All applications will be upvoted and/or downvoted by the community members with our tokens. Only applicants with the most upvotes will
secure a reserved space at our centers; other token holders will still have access and use
the common floor for workspace.

Examples of typical PRG transactions in ParagonSpace include (but are not limited to):
•  Opening doors by scanning a QR code of an active wallet with at least 1 PRG
•  Paying for your own and/or guest access. Renting floating or fixed desk space or
private office with PRG
•  Printing/scanning/faxing services at ParagonCoin Centers can be paid automatically with PRG
•  Paying for food, drinks, events, and merchandise with simple PRG checkout
•  Securing conferences, events, research, and educational space for the legalized
cannabis industry

2017

•  Buying time for photo/audio/video studio for product shootings, interviews, podcasts, etc.

18

•  Joining a social club and/or café for ParagonCoin Club members
•  Participating in web and in-app coworking, events, and a conference-reservation
system with instant PRG payment
•  Specialized retail services and SPAs with cannabis products at a flagship location with PRG payment and tipping (retail of cannabis products at spas limited to
jurisdictions where such cannabis products are legal)

Where and when feasible pursuant to applicable laws, ParagonSpace sites will also
host cannabis dispensaries, which will operate exclusively in our PRG tokens. These
will be flagship store locations, highlighting the new retail token technology that we
will make available to all cannabis retailers. The exclusive adoption of this new model will not only help with standardization but with supporting the global blockchain
and cannabis communities.
Examples of ParagonChain technology that will be used in ParagonSpace sites
include:
• Wallets
• Dashboards
• Electronic key to open doors at the co-working spaces
• SDKs to integrate to third-party POS (offline and online) to accept PRG
(until legalized — limited use)
• ATMs to convert PRG
• Speed PRG payment system

ParagonSpace acts as an incubator as well. A portion of the revenues from the ParagonSpace fees will be set aside in a “token fund.” Four times a year, 1% of all applications will receive additional funding from our “token fund” to make their own token
crowdsale to fund their legalization efforts.
ParagonSpace shares some similarities to WeWork, which claims “workspace designed for fresh ideas, organic networking, and month-to-month flexibility.” WeWork
reported $532M in revenue in 2016 with 110 locations, and claims a valuation of
$16B with 100,000 members. They have achieved this in less than 5 years. Paragon
appeals to a smaller segment of the population, but the need is much greater. We
expect to grow just as quickly and to have a measurably more loyal membership.
Our conservative projections for the first year are for 10 spaces, with 200 members
each, and each of those spending 30-50 PRG per day for office space and other
amenities. This equates to an annual run rate of close to 25M PRG.

2017

19

Some of these tokens may be removed from circulation as they are used to pay for
office building management, maintenance, and taxes. Diminished token numbers
may lead to an increased value of each token. We are committed to keeping as
much of the operational expenses as possible in PRG and to building a network of
suppliers who accept PRG as payment. We will further ensure that future issuances
of the token are inline with the demand we create through ParagonSpace’s growth.

3.4 PARAGONONLINE COMMUNITY
Not every cannabis business will be able to work at a ParagonSpace center. However, anyone with internet in any part of the world can access our full-service online platform. This platform will allow fans and serious entrepreneurs access to the
same blockchain community and technology. Even though members may be scattered around the world, their voices will be heard.

ParagonOnline Roles and Goals
The ParagonOnline community essentially serves as the steering committee for the
entire organization. They determine key priorities and directions for global actions.
New ideas and projects can be offered and discussed by the community, eventually
being pushed into development and production if the minimal upvote threshold is
achieved.
* Priorities in the ParagonCoin roadmap can be upvoted and downvoted as 		
well. The community will vote on and determine:
• Which cities get ParagonSpace buildings, which cities get 		
flagship centers
• What the community rules will be
• What blockchain and smart contract development will have 		
priority and be funded first
• Where to push for legalization initiatives
* Community members can meet in groups to discuss and vote. Some of 		
these groups will cover: current legal issues, political legalization efforts, 		
technical development, new business ideas, and new priorities.
* ParagonOnline will serve as the reservation and clearinghouse system for 		
ParagonSpace. Community members will be offered space based on their 		
standing in the community and on the basis of upvotes and downvotes 		
(each costing 0.01 PRG) received from their online contributions.

ParagonOnline is designed to be a “community-based” online space where tasks, functions,
goals, and priorities are defined and redefined in real-time by the community. Thus it allows for greater freedom and flexibility for users, businesses, and buyers of cannabis. The
structure of the Paragon platform encourages individuals to take long-term interests in one
project or speculate on a number of ideas.
ParagonOnline will act as a one-stop service and platform for cannabis and alternative payment- related scientists, journalists, investors, marketers, doctors, developers, fintech specialists, entrepreneurs, startups, and lawyers. Because every business is a human venture,
the professional networking potential will be highly beneficial. It will give the cannabis industry a whole new dimension.

2017

21

The decentralized platform for the legalization of marijuana will not only make professional
networking all the easier but, more crucially, make networking, in general, a natural part of
our culture. We can reach out to new people with a sense of increased professionalism
that heightens respect for the industry. Connections will be celebrated, encouraged, and
rewarded.
The aggregate collection of content will create a cannabis research library like no other. One
of the incentives that will drive consumers and businesses to use the Paragon platform is
that it rewards contributors who post content to the community. Users can be curators, contributors, or both. The more content uploaded by a member, the more their influence grows
and the more they will be “upvoted” and earn PRG. ParagonOnline will create substantial
demand for PRG. We estimate a devoted community of about 1 million in the first year and
that the average user will spend about 10 tokens. This brings an exchange of 10M PRG in
just the first year.

How Does ParagonOnline Work?
The “blockchain-based social media platform” model is characterized by the different ways
that the token is presented to users. At the root is the crypto-token, which is typically a transferable, fungible, freely moveable token similar to Bitcoin or Ether. ParagonOnline will work
like a blend of Reddit™ 9 and Steemit™ 10.
We leverage the best practices and approaches of Reddit and Steemit to create a new generation of online community specifically for the cannabis industry and community. It allows
a worldwide membership to upvote or downvote potential innovations and support them
with ParagonCoin (PRG). Thus, the community decides what projects are of most value and
which hold little interest.
Each member will have their own dashboard for membership registration, transaction history, networking, scheduling, event lists, etc. From there, they can join and keep track of niche
discussions that are important to them. They can track the progress of projects they have
supported. Here they will also upvote and downvote.

Reddit™ is an online social community that posts and discusses a wide range of topics. The platform is community
curated with up or down votes. Each member of the community has one vote and can propel an article to popularity with
upvotes or move it to obscurity with downvotes. Articles and comments are posted in channels or sub niches by topic.
9

10

Steemit™ takes Reddit to the next stage. It also uses community curated information, but it pays members for their work.
They can be paid for content, whether they write it, comment on it, or post someone else’s content. They vote posts up or
down by using Steem dollars. The more Steem Power they own, the more influential their vote and the more they, and the
person they comment on, get paid in the platform’s Steemit cryptocurrency.

2017

22

3.5 PARAGON ACCELERATOR
ParagonAccelerator will work within the ParagonSpace and ParagonOnline communities.
Both will have access to the extensive cannabis library and blockchain smart contract technology.
The platform will encourage Space residents and Online users to start their own businesses.
They may use simplified pre-formatted plug-and-play kinds of apps found on the platform to
quickly innovate. These can help them create two types of smart contracts for their apps.
They can receive funding from other Paragon members. All the technical and legal material
used to produce ParagonCoin will be available for members for their business projects,
even assisting in their own token crowdsales. Paragon is committed to stay at the forefront
of all cannabis and blockchain technology and to make it available to all Paragon users.
This creates a Paragon advantage that will draw the best and brightest to our community.
Some of the benefits of an applied incubator model include:

• Increased entrepreneurship
• Corporate downsizing
• New technologies
• Increased involvement of educational institutions in technology transfer
• Economic globalization

As a member of our specialized incubator, members will reap multiple benefits, such as the
ability to tap into a strong network of business partners11. Within the incubator, entrepreneurs and startup founders can access a support system where they could learn from the
mistakes of others before erring themselves.
Startups in the Paragon space will now have access to simplified banking in a formerly
unbankable industry. They can convert their cash to PRG, and from there, they can buy
supplies, pay labs, researchers, and technical support. The goal is to have all transactions
possible in PRG and to be a fully alternative method of payment .

2017

An incubator or accelerator can play a huge role in growing a cannabis startup. The ParagonAccelerator is uniquely linked to the growth of the legal cannabis industry. Our model
grows and develops with the industry autonomously, responding to the demand for new
businesses with revolutionary ideas.

Record number of clones (trimmings off Mother plants), usually 200-500 into
PTS and label tray

•

Once you transplant your hardiest clones to pots, record the number of tags
to print and record the number of clones died

Moving Plants
•

The RFID tags detect when a plant changes rooms and the system will ask
why? Different movement of plants like room transfer, harvest, waste, etc.
can be recorded for legal or grower’s purposes.

•

When moving a group of plants from room to room (ex: veg to bloom) you
can pre-select this move and the system will not alert on this movement.

Destroying Plants
•

If plants die, the system will record them as destroyed and a reason why (lack
of water, poor roots, mildew, etc.)

•

PTS can record 24/7 camera surveillance of the disposal bin to ensure no
backdoor selling of “destroyed” plants

After Harvest
•

Scan each harvested plant from that crop into system. Record weight if necessary.

•

Use PTS to record drying method (hang, rack, etc.) and number of days plant
is dried.

•

Weigh and record pre-trim and final post-trim weight for crop.

Clearly, using smart contracts on the blockchain technology can produce programs and
apps that make the job of the grower, wholesaler and retailer easier and more profitable.
Compliance becomes as easy as implementing a simple system. Consumers have all the
information they need for good decisions. Paragon encourages this kind of innovation
through ParagonAccelerator.

4. COLLABORATION WITH IOTA
For Data Integrity and distribution we will utilize IOTA which has no scaling limitations
on transactions. Through IOTA’s next generation distributed ledger ‘Tangle’ which consists
of a pure Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) instead of a sequential chain of blocks ParagonCoin
will be able to transmit and secure all kinds of data in a tamper proof fashion for free. Via
IOTA we can build an entire end-to-end verifiable audit trail of all the data and information
pertaining to the cannabis produce for free at a fine granular level in real time, ensuring full
transparency of provenance and meta information such as whether the cannabis is organically grown, exact amounts of pesticides/herbicides used, eco friendly certifications, THC/
CBD ratio etc. Having a complete data audit trail with cryptographically ensured integrity of
every aspect from production to consumption will be a game changer in enabling a thriving and sensible cannabis industry.In the future ParagonCoin will also explore utilizing the
unique approach that the IOTA platform takes to ‘oracles’, identity and other parts of its
development roadmap.

6. FINANCES
Token Crowdsale Parameters
Paragon seeks to be fully transparent in all its financial dealings. A measured release of tokens will give Paragon projects and ParagonCoin the opportunity to grow
and increase in influence. Escrowed funds and planned purchases of physical property are what sets Paragon above other token crowdsales.
Paragon will issue a total of 200,000,000 tokens. No additional tokens will ever be
generated. Distribution of the initial 100 million tokens will be through a series of
token offerings.
The pre-launch contribution timeline begins 30 days before the launch. It starts August 15, 2017. Within the first 10 days, early participants will receive a 25% discount
with a minimum $25k contribution. In the following 10 days, participants will receive
a 15% discount with a minimum $15k contribution. In the remaining 10 days, a 10%
discount will be given to participants with a minimum $10k contribution.
The Token Crowdsale launch begins September 15. The initial token price will be set
at $1 for this launch. During the first 5 hours of the token crowdsale we will offer an
early bird 5% discount. Following that, the price will remain at $1 for the remaining
of the first 24 hours. Then it will increase $0.05 each 24 hours for 30 days or until
all tokens sold.

2017

29

Token Crowdsale  Stage 1     50%
The Paragon Token Crowdsale Stage 1 represents the first round of raising capital of
100,000,000 PRG for the further development and implementation of our roadmap.

Token Crowdsale  Stage 2     25%
A total of 50,000,000 PRG will be reserved in escrow account. The full amount of PRG set in
reserve will be inaccessible for any other purposes than an additional fundraising round for
investors. The token crowdsale amount and time will be determined by community vote.
Stage 2 will happen no sooner than 2021, and all tokens will be sold at market price, not at
a fixed $1 USD value.
The remaining 50 million PRG will be held in reserve as follows (important note: all percentage below will be adjusted in accordance with actual amount raised, e.g., if we sell 70M of
100M tokens, the following numbers will be multiplied by 0.7):

Controlled Reserve Fund     20%
Unique to crowdsale startups, Paragon is dedicated to ensuring a stable token to serve
the purposes it represents. We are very aware of the ongoing issues with pump and dump
schemes that many cryptocurrencies are prone to and intend to address these. Additionally, short- and long-term fluctuations in circulating tokens can negatively impact the core
functionality of our business model. The Controlled Reserve Fund will be split into two core
functions to keep PRG stable.

The flowchart above depicts the possible flow of PRG funds.

2017

30

Release PRG to the markets if PRG deflates too fast and pushes token prices
up too rapidly.

The total PRG in circulation will gradually decrease - tokens will leave circulation and
return to Paragon as payment for services - as well as tokens lost as a transaction
burn. As a result, the market free float of PRG will decrease over time. However, in
the event that PRG displays severe price volatility as a direct result of scarcity: the
Reserve Fund may gradually sell PRG to the market in line with our minimum deflationary target of 2%.

Buy PRG from the market if PRG price devalues too much.

Despite our expectations for the value of PRG to increase as we receive payment in
PRG for our services (blockchain and smart contract solutions, ParagonSpace, etc.),
the cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. As a result, PRG may become
subject to excessive sell volume resulting in a significant drop in price. To counter
this, the Reserve Fund can intervene by buying back PRG in an effort to stabilize the
market price.
PRG is designed to appreciate in value as our solutions are adopted throughout the
cannabis industry and around the world. Our model incentivizes PRG owners to hold
their tokens as long term growth assets, in addition to spending PRG on any of our
platforms.
The Controlled Reserve Fund is the sole property of Paragon, and funds cannot be
accessed and distributed to employees or investors. Additionally, executives and
employees are prohibited from trading PRG for a 48-hour period following a buyback or sale from the Reserve Fund.

Community Reserve     5%
These special funds are held in reserve by the community to be awarded to the best
startup ideas. Those who meet eligibility requirements for our accelerator and are
upvoted by our community can be allocated funds.

Token Market Free Float
As a consequence of Paragon’s business model, the amount of tokens in free circulation will gradually decrease. Tokens used for community self-governing and
for downvoting will be “burned.” In addition, one-half of the transaction fees will be
burned. Moreover, PRG in circulation will gradually be channeled back to Paragon as
payment for our services and solutions, such as ParagonSpace.
A gradual reduction in circulating supply is part of Paragon’s plan to encourage PRG
price stability and growth, but above all, a solid price development over time. This
ensures a growth of PRG purchasing power over time. While 1,000 PRG may pay for
a month’s rent now, in the future, it might pay for a year’s rent.
2017

31

PRG Circulation Model
The relationship of supply and demand, the two variables that impact price, will be
the fundamental drivers of change in market price. Demand will be impacted by, but
not limited to: payment for Paragons services and co-working spaces. Supply will be
impacted by (I) the number of transactions; (II) revenue PRG services; (III) community self-governing and downvoting.
Based on the above, the free float for PRG can be calculated as follows:
FF PRG = (total token crowdsale funds raised)
-/- (#T x BR ) -/- ( $TRev ) + ( $ToM )
FF PRG = Free Float PRG
#T = number of transactions
BR = burn rate
$TRev = nominal value of PRG revenue flowing back
$ToM = nominal value of PRG sold in the open market
We aim to ensure an annual nominal circulating token deflation of 2% to provide a
natural hedge against the loss of purchasing power of fiat currency.

Transaction Fees
All fees on the Paragon ecosystem will be paid in PRG. The fee structure will
keep the price of each transaction low. Each transaction will cost $.000000005 or
5/1000000000 of a cent (5E-10%). One-half of the fee will be burned each time a
transaction occurs, and the other one-half will be deposited to the Paragon Reserve
Fund. With the cannabis market surpassing $100B market size in the US alone and
current banking issues, we’re hoping to bring a big share of it onto our platform.
Our initial ParagonCoin (PRG) inventory is 200m. We’ll call our Remaining PRG (X).
Each progressive Number of Transactions (n) are calculated as the difference of
remaining PRG in the previous Transaction Count (Xt-1 where nt-1) and the amount
of PRG burned. This is one-half of the calculated Total Commissions (Yt), in the
current Number of Transactions (n).
Total commissions at each Number of Transactions (n) is calculated by multiplying
n by the per unit commission. Per unit commission is figured as the sum of 0.025
and the product of 5E^(-9)% and the Remaining PRG (Xt-1 ) from the previous Transaction Count.

2017

32

As we can see from the visual, the number of remaining PRG decreases rapidly as
the Number of Transactions progressively increases.
There will be a small Ethereum fee (gas) applied to each transaction. Based on our
calculations, it will be around $0.01.

9. RISKS
ParagonCoin Token Generation Event Risk Factors
You should carefully consider and evaluate each of the following risk factors and all
other information contained in the Terms before deciding to participate in the PARAGONCOIN Token Generation Event (the “TGE”). To the best of PARAGONCOIN LTD
(Gibraltar) (the “Company”) knowledge and belief, all risk factors which are material
to you in making an informed judgment to participate in the TGE have been set out
below. If any of the following considerations, uncertainties or material risks develops into actual events, the business, financial position and/or results of operations
of the Company and the maintenance and level of usage of the PARAGONCOIN
platform and the PRG Tokens could be materially and adversely affected. In such
cases, the trading price of PRG Tokens (in the case where they are listed on a cryptocurrency exchange) could decline due to any of these considerations, uncertainties
or material risks, and you may lose all or part of your PRG Tokens.
1. RISKS RELATING TO PARTICIPATION IN THE TOKEN GENERATION EVENT
There is no prior market for PRG Tokens and the Token Generating Event (TGE) may
not result in an active or liquid market for the PRG Tokens
Prior to the TGE, there has been no public market for the PRG Tokens. Although the
Company will use reasonable endeavors to seek the approval for availability of the
PRG Tokens for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange, there is no assurance that
such approval will be obtained. Furthermore, even if such approval is granted by a
cryptocurrency exchange, there is no assurance that an active or liquid trading market for the PRG Tokens will develop, or if developed, will be sustained after the PRG
Tokens have been made available for trading on such cryptocurrency exchange.
There is also no assurance that the market price of the PRG Tokens will not decline
below the original purchase price (the “Purchase Price”). The Purchase Price may
not be indicative of the market price of the PRG Tokens after they have been made
available for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange.
A PRG Token is not a currency issued by any central bank or national, supra-national
or quasi-national organization, nor is it backed by any hard assets or other credit.
The Company is not responsible for, nor does it pursue, the circulation and trading
of PRG Tokens on the market. Trading of PRG Tokens will merely depend on the
consensus on its value between the relevant market participants. No one is obliged
to purchase any PRG Token from any holder of the PRG Token, including the purchasers, nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price of PRG Tokens to
any extent at any time.

2017

37

Furthermore, PRG Tokens may not be resold to purchasers who are citizens or permanent residents of Singapore or any other jurisdiction where the purchase of PRG
Tokens may be in violation of applicable laws (including but not limited to laws
regulating controlled substances, such as cannabis). Accordingly, the Company
cannot ensure that there will be any demand or market for PRG Tokens, or that the
Purchase Price is indicative of the market price of PRG Tokens after they have been
made available for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange.
Future sales or issuance of the PRG Tokens could materially and adversely affect the
market price of PRG Tokens
Any future sale or issuance of the PRG Tokens would increase the supply of PRG
Tokens in the market and this may result in a downward price pressure on the PRG
Token. The sale or distribution of a significant number of PRG Tokens outside of
the TGE (including but not limited to the sales of PRG Tokens undertaken after the
completion of the initial crowdsale, issuance of PRG Tokens to persons other than
purchasers for purposes of community initiatives, business development, academic
research, education and market expansion and issuance of PRG Tokens as a reward
to users of the PARAGONCOIN platform), or the perception that such further sales
or issuance may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the PRG Tokens.
Negative publicity may materially and adversely affect the price of the PRG Tokens
Negative publicity involving the Company, ParagonCoin, Inc. (the PARAGONCOIN
project’s operating entity organized in Delaware, USA), the PARAGONCOIN platform,
the PRG Tokens or any of the key personnel of the Company or ParagonCoin, Inc.,
regulation of cannabis in the US or worldwide, and/or regulation of cryptocurrencies
in the US or worldwide, may materially and adversely affect the market perception or
market price of the PRG Tokens, whether or not it is justified.
We may not be able to pay any anticipated rewards in the future
There is no assurance that there will be sufficient engagement in the PARAGONCOIN platform such that you will receive any rewards anticipated to be distributed
to active users of the PARAGONCOIN platform. Further, even in the event there is
substantial engagement and interactions among the users and the PARAGONCOIN
platform, there is no assurance you personally will receive any part of the rewards.
This is because the ability of the Company to pay any reward to you will depend on
the future results of operations and the future business and financial condition of
the Company and/or ParagonCoin, Inc., and there is no assurance of the future results of operations and the future business and financial condition of the Company
or ParagonCoin, Inc.

2017

38

There is no assurance of any success of PARAGONCOIN Platform or any Future Business Line
The value of, and demand for, the PRG Tokens hinges heavily on the performance
of the PARAGONCOIN platform and the continuous active engagement of its users
and success of its contemplated business lines. There is no assurance that the
PARAGONCOIN platform will gain traction after its launch and achieve any commercial success. Furthermore, there is no assurance that any of the business lines contemplated by ParagonCoin, Inc. will be launched and generate sufficient customer
traction. Such contemplated business lines currently include but are not limited to:
(a) create an immutable ledger for all legal cannabis industry related data via ParagonChainTM, (b) offer payment for legal cannabis industry related services and
supplies through PRG Tokens, (c) establish niche coworking spaces via ParagonSpaceTM, (d) organize and unite global cannabis legalization efforts through ParagonOnlineTM, and (e) bring standardization of licensing, lab testing, transactions,
supply chain and ID verification through apps built in ParagonAcceleratorTM. Although ParagonCoin, Inc. has performed several market studies testing the demand
for the PARAGONCOIN platform with relatively positive results, the PARAGONCOIN
platform has not been fully developed and finalized and is subject to further changes, updates, and adjustments prior to its launch. Such changes may result in unexpected and unforeseen effects on its projected appeal to users, possibly due to the
failure to meet users’ preconceived expectations based on the beta version, and
hence, impact its success. While the Company has made every effort to provide a
realistic estimate, there is also no assurance that the cryptocurrencies raised in the
TGE will be sufficient for the development of the PARAGONCOIN platform and/or for
the proper structuring and licensing of the anticipated PARAGONCOIN future anticipated business lines. For the foregoing or any other reason, the development of the
PARAGONCOIN platform and launch of the anticipated PARAGONCOIN future business lines may not be completed and there is no assurance that it will be launched
at all. As such, distributed PRG Tokens may hold little worth or value.
The funds raised in the Token Generation Event are exposed to risks of theft
The Company will make every effort to ensure that the funds received from the TGE
will be securely held in an escrow wallet, which is a multi-signature address with
access thereto by private keys held by reputable and trusted parties. Further, upon
receipt of the funds from the Company, ParagonCoin, Inc. will make every effort to
ensure that the funds received by it from the Company will be securely held through
the implementation of security measures. Notwithstanding such security measures,
there is no assurance that there will be no theft of the cryptocurrencies as a result of
hacks, sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects on the TGE website, in the smart contract(s) on which the escrow
wallet and the TGE relies, on the Ethereum or any other blockchain, or otherwise.

2017

39

Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof. In such event, even if the TGE is completed,
the Company or ParagonCoin, Inc. may not be able to receive the cryptocurrencies
raised and ParagonCoin, Inc. may not be able to use such funds for the development of the PARAGONCOIN platform and/or for launching any future business line,
including but not limited to the structuring and licensing of the PARAGONCOIN future business lines. In such case, the launch of the PARAGONCOIN platform and
the structuring and licensing of the PARAGONCOIN future business lines might be
temporarily or permanently curtailed. As such, distributed PRG Tokens may hold
little worth or value.
2. RISKS RELATING TO THE ESCROW WALLET
The private keys to the escrow wallet may be compromised and the cryptocurrencies
may not be able to be disbursed
The escrow wallet is designed to be secure. Each of the holders of the three (3)
private keys to the escrow wallet will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard their
respective keys, but in the unlikely event that any two (2) of the three (3) keys to the
escrow wallet are, for any reason whatsoever, lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised, the funds held by the escrow wallet may not be able to be retrieved and
disbursed, and may be permanently unrecoverable. In such event, even if the TGE
is successful, the Company will not be able to receive the funds raised and ParagonCoin, Inc. will not be able to use such funds for the development of the PARAGONCOIN platform and the structuring and licensing of the PARAGONCOIN future
business lines. As such, distributed PRG Tokens may hold little worth or value.
3. RISKS RELATING TO PARAGONCOIN, INC.
The PARAGONCOIN platform is developed, operated, and maintained by ParagonCoin, Inc. Any events or circumstances which adversely affect ParagonCoin, Inc.
or any of its successor operating entities (collectively referred to herein as “ParagonCoin, Inc.”) may have a corresponding adverse effect on the PARAGONCOIN
platform and any future business line, including but not limited to structuring and
launch of the PARAGONCOIN future business lines. Such adverse effects would
correspondingly have an impact on the utility, liquidity, and the trading price of the
PRG Tokens.
ParagonCoin, Inc. may be materially and adversely affected if it fails to effectively
manage its operations as its business develops and evolves, which would have a
direct impact on its ability to maintain the PARAGONCOIN platform and/or launch
any future business lines

2017

40

The financial technology and cryptocurrency industries and the legal cannabis markets in which ParagonCoin, Inc. competes have grown rapidly over the past four
years and continue to evolve in response to new technological advances, changing
business models, shifting regulations and other factors. As a result of this constantly changing environment, ParagonCoin, Inc. may face operational difficulties
in adjusting to the changes, and the sustainability of ParagonCoin, Inc. will depend
on its ability to manage its operations, ensure that it hires qualified and competent
employees, and provides proper training for its personnel. As its business evolves,
ParagonCoin, Inc. must also expand and adapt its operational infrastructure. ParagonCoin, Inc.’s business relies on its blockchain-based software systems, cryptocurrency wallets or other related token storage mechanisms, blockchain technology
and smart contract technology, and efficient real estate management. All of these
systems, tools, and skillsets represent complex, costly, and rapidly changing technical infrastructure. In order to demonstrate continued ability to effectively manage
technical support infrastructure for the PARAGONCOIN platform, ParagonCoin, Inc.
will need to continue to upgrade and improve its data systems and other operational
systems, procedures, and controls. These upgrades and improvements will require
a dedication of resources and are likely to be complex and increasingly rely on hosted computer services from third parties that ParagonCoin, Inc. does not control.
If ParagonCoin, Inc. is unable to adapt its systems and organization in a timely,
efficient, and cost-effective manner to accommodate changing circumstances, its
business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If
the third parties whom ParagonCoin, Inc. relies on are subject to a security breach
or otherwise suffer disruptions that impact the services ParagonCoin, Inc. uses, the
integrity and availability of its internal information could be compromised, which
may consequently cause the loss of confidential or proprietary information and economic loss. The loss of financial, labor or other resources, and any other adverse
effect on ParagonCoin, Inc.’s business, financial condition and operations, would
have a direct adverse effect on ParagonCoin, Inc.’s ability to maintain the PARAGONCOIN platform and/or to structure and license the anticipated PARAGONCOIN
future business lines. Any adverse effects affecting ParagonCoin, Inc.’s business or
technology are likely to also adversely impact the utility, liquidity, and trading price
of the PRG Tokens.
ParagonCoin, Inc. may experience system failures, unplanned interruptions in its
network or services, hardware or software defects, security breaches or other
causes that could adversely affect ParagonCoin, Inc.’s infrastructure network, and/
or the PARAGONCOIN platform

2017

41

ParagonCoin, Inc. is not able to anticipate when there would be occurrences of
hacks, cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects in the PARAGONCOIN platform, the smart contracts on which the Company,
ParagonCoin, Inc., or the PARAGONCOIN platform relies or on the Ethereum or any
other blockchain. Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or
source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof. ParagonCoin, Inc. may not be
able to detect such hacks, cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service errors vulnerabilities or defects in a timely manner, and may not have sufficient resources to
efficiently cope with multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid
succession.
ParagonCoin, Inc.’s network or services, which would include the PARAGONCOIN
platform and, if successfully structured, licensed, and launched, the PARAGONCOIN
future business lines, could be disrupted by numerous events, including natural disasters, equipment breakdown, network connectivity downtime, power losses, or
even intentional disruptions of its services, such as disruptions caused by software
viruses or attacks by unauthorized users, some of which are beyond ParagonCoin,
Inc.’s control. Although ParagonCoin, Inc. has taken steps against malicious attacks
on its appliances or its infrastructure, which are critical for the maintenance of the
PARAGONCOIN platform, there can be no assurance that cyber-attacks, such as
distributed denials of service, will not be attempted in the future, that ParagonCoin,
Inc.’s enhanced security measures will be effective. ParagonCoin, Inc. may be prone
to attacks on its infrastructure intended to steal information about its technology,
financial data or user information or take other actions that would be damaging to
ParagonCoin, Inc. and/or holders of the PRG Tokens. Any significant breach of ParagonCoin, Inc.’s security measures or other disruptions resulting in a compromise
of the usability, stability, and security of the PARAGONCOIN platform may adversely
affect the utility, liquidity and/or trading price of the PRG Tokens.
We are dependent in part on the location and data center facilities of third parties
ParagonCoin, Inc.’s current infrastructure network is in part established through
servers which it owns and houses at the location facilities of third parties, and servers that it rents at data center facilities of third parties. If ParagonCoin, Inc. is unable
to renew its data facility lease on commercially reasonable terms or at all, ParagonCoin, Inc. may be required to transfer its servers to a new data center facility,
and may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with
the relocation. These facilities are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from,
among others, natural disasters, arson, terrorist attacks, power losses, and telecommunication failures. Additionally, the third-party providers of such facilities may suffer a breach of security as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance
or otherwise, and a third party may obtain unauthorized access to the data in such
servers. Inc. and the providers of such facilities may be unable to anticipate these
techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.

2017

42

General global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on ParagonCoin’s operating performance, results of operations, and cash flows
ParagonCoin, Inc. has been and could continue to be affected by general global economic and market conditions. Challenging economic conditions worldwide have from
time to time, contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the information technology industry at large. Weakness in the economy could have a negative
effect on ParagonCoin, Inc.’s business, operations and financial condition, including
decreases in revenue and operating cash flows, and inability to attract future equity
and/or debt financing on commercially reasonable terms. Additionally, in a down-cycle economic environment, ParagonCoin, Inc. may experience the negative effects of a
slowdown in trading and usage of the PARAGONCOIN platform and may delay or cancel
the structuring, licensing, and launch of the anticipated PARAGONCOIN future business
lines. Suppliers on which ParagonCoin, Inc. relies for servers, bandwidth, location and
other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that, in turn,
could have a negative impact on ParagonCoin, Inc.’s operations or expenses. There can
be no assurance, therefore, that current economic conditions or worsening economic
conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant, adverse impact on ParagonCoin, Inc.’s business, financial condition and results of operations, and
hence, the PARAGONCOIN platform and/or ability to structure, license, and launch the
PARAGONCOIN future business lines. Any such circumstances would then correspondingly negatively impact the utility, liquidity, and/or trading price of the PRG Tokens.

The Company, ParagonCoin, Inc., or the PRG Tokens may be affected by newly implemented regulations
Cryptocurrency trading is generally unregulated worldwide, but numerous regulatory authorities across jurisdictions have been outspoken about considering the implementation of regulatory regimes which govern cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency markets. Furthermore, while the US experiences a liberalization of cannabis regulations at the state
level, cannabis remains illegal at the federal level. The Company or the PRG Tokens
may be affected by newly implemented regulations relating to cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency markets, and/or legal cannabis industry, including having to take measures
to comply with such regulations, or having to deal with queries, notices, requests or enforcement actions by regulatory authorities, which may come at a substantial cost and
may also require substantial modifications to the PARAGONCOIN platform and/or the
anticipated PARAGONCOIN future business lines. This may impact the appeal of the PARAGONCOIN platform and the anticipated PARAGONCOIN future business lines for users
and result in decreased usage of the PARAGONCOIN platform and the PRG Tokens. Further, should the costs (financial or otherwise) of complying with such newly implemented regulations exceed a certain threshold, maintaining the PARAGONCOIN platform and

Abstract
A blockchain powered health information exchange (HIE) can unlock
the true value of interoperability and cyber security. This system has the
potential to eliminate the friction and costs of current third party intermediaries, when considering population health management. There are
promises of improved data integrity, reduced transaction costs, decentralization and disintermediation of trust. Being able to coordinate patient
care via a blockchain HIE essentially alleviates unnecessary services and
duplicate tests with lowering costs and improvements in efficiencies of the
continuum care cycle, while adhering to all HIPAA rules and standards. A
patient-centered protocol supported by blockchain technology, Patientory
is changing the way healthcare stakeholders manage electronic medical
data and interact with clinical care teams.

Introduction
What is Blockchain?

The technology behind the bitcoin digital currency, blockchain’s birth is traced
to the pseudonymous, unidentified person (or group) known as Satoshi Nakamoto.
Since 2009 blockchain has gained more widespread use in the finance industry,
with a variety of new blockchain-enabled businesses and services entering the
market. Blockchain’s technology is used to share a ledger of transactions across
a business network without control by any single entity. The distributed ledger
makes it easier to create cost-efficient commercial relationships where virtually
anything of value that can be tracked and traded without requiring a central
point of control. The technology puts privacy and control of data in the hands of
1

the individual. Trust and integrity is established without reliance on third-party
intermediaries.

1.2

Current Healthcare Infrastructure

The realignment from a “procedure” based focus to “holistic care of the individual” requires Care Providers form “networks” that work together towards a
common goal of improving the care outcome of patients under care, for postacute care episodes or between acute care episodes. The need for cooperation
between care-providers ranging from specialists, primary care physicians, caregivers and wellness providers (like nutritionist and rehabilitation nurses) results
in increasing use of digital technologies. Though these solutions have significantly improved the tracking and efficiency for delivering care, they have resulted in creating silos of health information, primarily within electronic medical
records (EMR) systems.
Health and government organizations spend a significant amount of time
and money setting up and managing traditional information systems and data
exchanges; requiring resources to continuously troubleshoot issues, update field
parameters, perform backup and recovery measures, and extract information
for reporting purposes.
Federal laws and incentive programs have made health care data more accessible, in response to hospital pushback regarding EMR implementation. However, the vast majority of hospital systems still can’t easily (or safely) share
their data. As a result, doctors are spending more time typing than actually
talking to patients. Physician burnouts jumped from 45 to 54 percent between
2011 and 2014 [1].
Although there exists the notion of “individualized” health information both
on the clinical as well as wellness front, these have not translated into “personalized” plans of care. Furthermore, even though there is a plethora of data, the
overall healthcare ecosystem is incapable of adequately engineering a value or
risk to big data to help better predict future care episodes of a patient.
Hence the current solutions pursued by the Health Care technology industry have resulted in a difficult choice between care and privacy/economic fraud
for patients. We see this issue greatly expanding as more data is being created by the industry. Blockchain’s secure technology, properties, and
distributed nature can help reduce the cost and efficiency of these
operations as well as provide a viable security infrastructure.

1.3

Patient-Provider Relationship

The new healthcare paradigm demands the need for effective and optimal care
delivery for patients to yield better care outcomes. This requires that Principal
Care providers are able to actively coordinate and collaborate with other care
providers involved and ancillary health organizations like Labs and Pharmacies
in care delivery. Ultimately, for this to be successfully patient records need to
be updated and modified in a timely manner.
2

Figure 1: Patientory Schematic
EMR software currently prohibits an effective patient-provider relationship.
Patient portals have minimal engagement among patients, as a result of the
siloed patient experience. Furthermore, this software only provides a limited
capability of exchange of information from one system to another and usually
requires a designated individual who is capable of such information transfer.
This has led to an increasing amount of delay between organizations in delivering
care for the patient and also resulted in the overall decrease in quality of delivery
of care services to the patient. Also, as care providers are spending more of their
time involved in coordination of care, their effectiveness in treatment of patients
and workload has significantly increased. This has resulted in a counter-intuitive
impact in care outcomes for patients.
In addition, given that many doctors don’t want patients to access EHRs,
patients adopt a passive role in tracking their health. This ultimately makes
them feel a lack of control and ownership of their health leading to the patient
becoming frustrated and being disengaged in their care. Though there is a recent
increase in Mobile Health Care apps helping individuals track their vitals and
health parameters, the novelty has not translated to improved patient care or
adherence and outcomes as it too faces the challenges of getting integrated into
EHRs.

System Overview

These current issues are solved using the Patientory Blockchain Network. Legacy
EMR are centralized structures subject to hacking, strict security regulations,
and onerous overhead costs. By implementing the Patientory Blockchain infrastructure, providers will see minimized breaches due to the inherent access
control properties of the system; a channel for facilitated care coordination with
results in overall improvement in health outcomes. Above is a schematic describing the Patientory blockchain infrastructure and its interoperability among
patients and their providers.

3.1

System Implementation
HIPAA Regulations and Compliance Guidelines

Prior to any meaningful discussion of implementations, the restrictions enforced
by the mandates of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996 (HIPAA) must be addressed. Those rules of primary concern are the
Privacy Rule, the Security Rule, and the Cloud Computing Guidelines. The
intent of this paper is not to perform a full investigation of HIPAA law. Those
elements that are pertinent to the implementation discussion shall be defined
and further discussed upon the moment of relevant application.
A. Privacy Rule
The business model of Patientory provides that the Privacy Rule requirements must be observed due to the electronic storage and transmission of private
health information. Applicability of the privacy rule is summarized as, “The
Privacy Rule. . . (applies) to health plans, health care clearinghouses, and to
any healthcare provider who transmits health information in electronic form”
[2]. In addition to these agents, those parties that act on their behalf, as service providers, are also responsible for HIPAA compliance. These second hand
agents are termed Business Associates (BA), and the legal document that defines the rules and regulations that the BA must adhere to is termed Business
Associate Contract (BAC). HIPAA places strict requirements on the nature of
these agreements.
The points of merit, from an initial investigation, are those requirements
that specify the authorization of use, the use of de-identified information, and
the definition of private information. Private health information (PHI or ePHI
for electronic data) is defined as “all individually identifiable health information
held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associate, in any form
or media, whether electronic, paper, or oral”[2]. De-Identified health information is defined as “Health information that does not identify an individual and
with respect to which there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual is not individually identifiable health
information” [2]. De-Identified data use restrictions are summarized by the following, “There are no restrictions on the use or disclosure of de-identified health
information. De-identified health information neither identifies nor provides a
reasonable basis to identify an individual” [3]. The boundary of identifiable
data to de-identifiable data is defined as any information that may restrict the
possible number of individuals a collection of information is associated with to
less than 0.04% of the total US population.
B. Security Rule and Cloud Computing Guidelines
Due to the length of the content associated with this topic, only those elements of primary concern are isolated for reference. These primary concerns
are as follows, “When a covered entity engages the services of a CSP to create,
receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI (such as to process and/or store ePHI), on
its behalf, the CSP is a business associate under HIPAA. Further, when a business associate subcontracts with a CSP to create, receive, maintain, or transmit

4

ePHI on its behalf, the CSP subcontractor itself is a business associate. This
is true even if the CSP processes or stores only encrypted ePHI and lacks an
encryption key for the data. Lacking an encryption key does not exempt a CSP
from business associate status and obligations under the HIPAA Rules. As a
result, the covered entity (or business associate) and the CSP must enter into
a HIPAA-compliant business associate agreement (BAA), and the CSP is both
contractually liable for meeting the terms of the BAA and directly liable for
compliance with the applicable requirements of the HIPAA Rules” [3].
Covered entities often use cloud storage providers (CSPs) to store health
information, often citing that it is more cost effective and there are lower IT
management costs. However, as consumers rely on cloud providers to store
personal data, they relinquish direct control over that data and, as a result
are unaware of who has access and where the data is geographically located.
Even if an explicit business associate agreement is developed between the BA
and the cloud storage provider, it would only provide the terms of who takes
responsibility of the privacy and security of the data in the event a breach occurs.
The consumer would potentially have control over access to these data streams,
but would rely on the cloud storage provider to enforce those privileges.
Although the use of cloud storage is popular, there are still a number of risks
that a consumer undertakes when using this mechanism for their personal data.
In cloud-based architecture, data is replicated and moved frequently, so the
risks of unauthorized data use increases. Additionally, multiple individuals are
granted potential access to the data, such as administrators, network engineers,
and technical experts that perform services on, or for, the servers that host this
data. This also increases the risk of unauthorized access and use.
However, even if the data is secure through strict access controls and is
encrypted at its point of origin and while in transit, it still poses a problem
for the development of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMs). The
concept of a PROM is to develop a patient-focused measure that relates to an
area or focus that is of concern to the patient, and one in which their engagement
and feedback is essential for its successful implementation. Accessing large data
streams from a variety of devices that are part of the IoT network, as used now,
in conjunction with cloud based services can provide a foundation on which to
base a PROM, but it is difficult to know whether that data siloed in the cloud
will produce a measure that will have the intended meaning and relevancy for
a patient.
Implementation of blockchain technology to ensure and enhance data security for all the medical records associated with the system can minimize health
breaches and ultimate decentralization of record ownership. The process of encrypting data when sent to database using different algorithms and decrypting
it during the retrieval will be used.Data shall be encrypted using NIST compliant algorithms during transmission and retrieval as is mandated by law. Thus,
all exchange of information will comply with those best practices outlined in
the NIST specifications.
In regards to the rapid growing number of data breaches facing the
healthcare industry, blockchain technology makes HIPAA compliance
5

feasible for both patients and providers.
C. Blockchain System Analysis of Limitations due to HIPAA Restrictions
The Ethereum Blockchain facilitates a diverse subset of system implementations due to the application of a Turing complete programming language that is
executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. These systems have limitations in
that the virtual machine has no direct outward facing inspection of the broader
internet except through the use of Oracle Services. Additionally, the storage
limitations of the blockchain are enforced by the gas cost of storage and gas
cost of access to this data. As of this writing, the block time of the chain
establishes a minimum bound for state modifying requests of at least fifteen
seconds.
The limitation of the blockchain to host private information may be overcome through data obfuscation, such as encryption, but in the event that the
decryption key is ever leaked, there is no way to remove the sensitive data itself from the blockchain. For the purpose of HIPAA compliant data, this may
potentially result in a persistent, uncorrectable leak of information due to the
immutability of the blockchain itself. Although de-identified data may, in theory, be stored on the Public Ethereum Blockchain, it would be disastrous to
assume that the de-identification filtering mechanism will never fail, or that the
sideband information associated with blockchain interactions can not inadvertently reveal identity. This conclusion was also reached by the MIT Media Lab
during the formation of the MedRec Protocols and summarized in the MedRec
Whitepaper [3]. Mining this sideband information may be as simple as observing
timestamps and interactions with known data storage contracts.
Through this analysis it may be possible to associate an individual with an
institution, and more importantly the time during which they were present at a
facility. Given the specialized nature of some facilities, this is enough information to constitute a violation of HIPAA compliance due to a passive observer’s
ability to infer both identity, location, time of interaction, and possibly, class of
diagnosis.
Pending that this location is remote in nature, the reduction to less than
0.04% of the US population becomes trivial. These facts constitute unreasonable single point failures that must be acknowledged. Further, the direct storage
of even encrypted information on the blockchain creates a responsibility of the
database managers to enter into a BAC due to their actions as a HIPAA data
storage facility (See section titled Security Rule and Cloud Computing Guidelines). This is an unreasonable expectation since every miner, and even those
individuals hosting passive nodes, would all need be HIPAA compliant. Due
to these concerns, we implement a mechanism for the persistent storage of sensitive information through the use a private implementation of an Ethereum
based blockchain.
D. Implementation Goals for Usability and Security
The primary goals of any secure system may be summarized as the goals
of confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability and information/identity
assurance. In order to accommodate these goals an attacker and user must be
6

defined. Each of these roles demands certain acknowledgements of ability. From
the perspective of the user, the system need be sufficiently transparent that no
advanced knowledge is needed. Also, due to the inability of the normal user
to grasp the complex considerations of cybersecurity, the process needs to be
resistant to the actions of the user.
In the event that an attack does occur, the system is created such that
the amount of effort that must be invested to compromise a resource is worth
more than the value of the resource itself. This is due to the realization that a
sufficiently advanced party with appropriate resources will always be capable of
violating any system, given enough time and effort. More compactly, there is no
perfect defense. With these restrictions in mind, the implementation itself may
now be discussed such that we achieve all of the goals previously mentioned.

3.2

Definition of Hardware and Network Implementation

To accommodate the above stated design goals, the selected system implementation requires several independent systems. Each system subdivides authority,
ensures only authorized entities may interact in an approved manner, and provides a mechanism to increase security while maintaining availability. This
system has also been devised such that scaling may be readily accomplished
through the addition of hierarchical calling schemes. These systems are fully
described in detail below.
The public facing entity is a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Server that
acts as an interface to a private implementation of the Ethereum Blockchain
(permissioned blockchain). This network of blockchain nodes, is only authorized
to interact with the other blockchain nodes, a key authoring entity, the HIPAA
compliant storage facility, and the RPC Server. The key authoring entity is
the resource that generates private/public key pairs for use on the blockchain.
The HIPAA compliant storage facility hosts the actual data that constitutes
electronic private health information (ePHI).
When a request for data does occur, the HIPAA compliant system may
be authorized to speak to the forwarding agent, who then re-routes data back
to the RPC server. Alternatively, it may be structured such that the HIPAA
storage speaks directly to the RPC server. Each implementation has benefits
that must be considered prior to final selection. In either event, the HIPAA
storage facility decrypts the relevant portions of the database upon request
handling. This decrypted information is then re-encrypted using the public key
of the requesting party for transmission. This public key is also the public key
of the contract that acts as the control interface from the blockchain to the
HIPAA data.
The diagram of the specified network topology may be seen at figure 2.

3.3

Definition of Software Implementation

In addition to the physical isolation of systems in the hardware and network
implementation, software access control facilitates the integrity of data and
7

Figure 2: Patientory Blockchain Network Topography

verification of authorization for requesting entities. The software system, from
the perspective of access control and data encryption is described below.
The HIPAA compliant database will only accept inbound connections from
the HIPAA forwarder. This ensures that the flow of traffic is isolated to known
controlled paths. The HIPAA forwarder will only act to forward a request to
the HIPAA storage facility pending a valid transaction has occurred on the
blockchain, and this transaction resulted in the emission of a requesting event.
This requesting event need contain the public key of the requesting party, and
those data fields being requested. Finally, the RPC server uses an access controlled Application program interface (API) such that only known users may
interact with the server.
In order to understand the call hierarchy of the system, the contract structure
to facilitate access control must first be addressed. Every user in the system
maps to a private address on the private blockchain. Every private address is
only authorized to directly speak to ONE contract on the block chain. This
contract is the individual’s class contract. Institutions, institution employees,
and customers are class level objects.
These class level objects are permission-based interfaces. The Institution
Contract has a list of all customers that have granted viewing privileges to
the institution and each customer contract has a list of all institutions that
it has granted permission to. The contract held by the institution has functions that facilitate any revocation of permissions to the institution, from the
user. The institution contract may not self alter this list, thus preventing unauthorized access to individuals’ records. Additionally, the
Institution Contract possesses a list of authorized employees that it is fully capable of maintaining. This permission scheme should ideally function such that
automatic revocation of a permission is performed at semi-regular intervals to
prevent an institution from inadvertently preserving former employees’ access
rights.
Within this system, all external parties interact through the submission of
signed transactions that encode the requesting call. These transactions are
submitted through the RPC server upon user validation. The RPC server posts
these requests to the data aggregation server who then forwards these requests
to the miners based on a load sharing mechanism. The miners then process the
request by submitting the transaction on behalf of the calling party to the party’s
respective controlling contract. This contract holds the permissions of the data
that the entity is authorized to access internal to the contract. This contract is
the only entity that will accept a transaction from an outside request. Thus, a
mechanism is established to fully control call operations on the blockchain.
For any given transaction, an immutable record of the calling party is created. This ensures that all attempts to access information are recorded. The
actual data stored within the user contract is a system of hash pointers that
when resolved by the HIPAA storage server result in the return of the appropriate data. This information is bubbled up to the HIPAA forwarder by the
execution of a valid request transaction. The mechanism that facilitates this
communication is indirect and manifests through the blockchain event mes9

saging system. Due to the limitation that the requester may only query the
database by valid transaction, and the user may not directly alter their own
information, access control is provable. From the perspective of institutions,
the mechanisms are similar except the institution contract hosts a list of users
from whom it may request data and a list of users who may interact with this
institution as employees. When a request transaction originates from the contract of an institution employee, the controlling contract calls the institution
contract, who calls the user contract to ask for the data pointers that resolve
ePHI. Pending the institution is on the list of approved institutions for the user,
the contract returns the appropriate hash pointers. These pointers are then
published as an event message that again bubbles up to the HIPAA storage
facility.
For clarity, the full process of a single request is as follows: The
external party requests data from the service by calling the RPC
server with a cryptographically signed transaction for submission to
the blockchain. The RPC server verifies the external party’s identity
via the signature of a login request.
Pending the signature matches an entry in the database of permissioned
public keys, the RPC server accepts the request and submits the request to
the Data Aggregate Machine. The Data Aggregate Machine then submits the
requests to the private blockchain verifiers. The verifiers receive the request as
a call from a blockchain account against a target contract. The verifiers execute
this call, and in the event that the request is an allowable action, the transaction
is entered in the next block. This transaction also causes the emission of an
event message in the blockchain. This event message is observed by the HIPAA
Forwarder, who acts to create an encrypted request against the HIPAA storage
based on the hashes of the event message. This message also contains the public
key of the requesting party. The HIPAA compliant database system observes
this request and transmits an encrypted copy of the information to the RPC
server using the public key of the requesting party. The RPC server then returns
this information to the requesting party by remapping the requesting IP to the
public key in the message. The RPC server transmits this message without ever
having seen the underlying data. This data is then immediately destroyed by
the RPC server, thus ensuring that the RPC server acts as a conduit that need
not be HIPAA compliant.
The mechanism to publish data is again similar in nature, but the data
that is to be submitted is encrypted with the public key of the HIPAA storage
facility. The other operations are identical except the data that is being posted
bubbles up through the event message system. Thus, due to the use of low
collision hashing functions and timestamped nonces, data may be stored with
the contract being capable of computing the address at which submitted data
is located within the HIPAA storage facility.
Finally, the distribution of private keys to entities must be addressed. This
may be facilitated through optical means to smartphone users. This is analogous to the use of QR codes as addresses for Ethereum addresses. Alternate
means may also be established using applications on both desktop computers
10

and tablet/smartphone devices. The loss of a key is not a catastrophic event,
due to the ability to administratively strip a controlling contract’s access control
from one key and grant it to another.

3.4

Interoperability

EHR systems are based on an isolated credential validation architecture in which
patient data is kept in each of the separate systems. This has resulted in one-toone care co-ordination software “add-ons” solutions to these systems to enable
the coordination of care across other providers and ancillary health organizations. However, the access of the information from the principal Provider
organization to the other organizations is only via limited capability in instances such as to Read, to Submit, to Send or to Notify. Furthermore, the
Patient/Consumer has very limited interaction or involvement in this exchange
of information. In addition, a drawback to the existent mechanisms of data exchange is the difficulty in rectification of errors that occur during the submission
process.
Once a blockchain and its smart contracts are configured, the parameters
become absolute. The patient becomes the primary intermediary in sending
and receiving health information negating the need for frequent updates and
troubleshooting of any software. Since blockchain records are also immutable
and stored across all participating users, recovery contingencies are unnecessary.
Moreover, blockchain’s transparent information structure could abolish many
data exchange integration points and time consuming reporting activities.

3.5

Processes and Scalability

Users are in control of all their information and transfers which ensures high
quality data which is complete, consistent, timely, accurate, and widely available thus making it durable and reliable. Due to the decentralized database,
blockchain does not have a central point of failure and is better able to withstand
malicious attacks.

Figure 3: Blockchain Process Flow Diagram

11

In any Care network it is necessary to ensure that participants who are collaborating together can depend on each other to deliver the necessary services
that are expected of them. To achieve that, there has to be a means to ensure
accountability of task and services that are expected to be delivered in a timely
manner and also associated liability if they are not delivered in a timely manner
at the level of quality that is expected. Hence, any Health Care infrastructure
has to be capable of seamlessly being able to monitor the necessary information
to enable the Primary Care Provider to evaluate his Care network. Furthermore, as the Care network grows and these interaction between network care
providers increase the Health Care infrastructure should be capable of effectively
addressing this scale.
The key aspect to building a highly scalable and distributed Care Management system is a peer-to-peer architectural framework. Such a framework
has already been used in a number of industry segments like, media, sports,
real estate, supply-chain, displaying blockchain can easily be an add-on software connector to existing centralized frameworks[7]. This has led us to explore
using the block chain framework for its applicability to help with enabling a
peer-to-peer framework for healthcare.
Block-chain holds the promise of validating two or more entities engaged
in a “healthcare transaction”. This provides two key attributes compared to
a centralized authentication model. The first being, that interested parties
can engage with each other at a “transaction level” of “trust relationship”.
The second is that the liability exposure in such a relationship is limited to
only “transaction level” engagement. This is very useful as it limits the access
of information and liabilities between parties involved and at the same time
enables a party to get into a transaction relationship with a number of other
providers based on their specific capabilities and type of care to be delivered to
the patient. This is significantly better than a conventional centralized systems
needing to limit the number of providers for a wide range of patient needs due
to effort required to manage the access and liabilities.

3.6

Health Information Exchange and Tokens

The Patientory token (PTOY) is the fuel for driving the blockchain infrastructure. The primary usage of the token is to regulate network storage allocation,
health care quality measures and revenue payment cycles.
Patients are given an allotted amount of space to store information for free
on the Patientory network. PTOY allows them to purchase extra storage space
from nodes set up in hospitals systems. PTOY can be purchased via the platform or an exchange.
Healthcare organizations use PTOY in this instance as well. It is also used
in payments once smart contracts are executed with healthcare insurance companies and serves as a mechanism to regulate value based model metrics.
In order for the US to successfully move away from the fee-for-service model
to the current value-based model, there has to be a healthcare IT infrastructure that allows organizations to link quality, value and effectiveness of medical
12

interventions through a reputable compensation model.
Compensation will be based on how effective the network of providers’ work
together to ensure improvement in the quality of care and wellness outcomes,
while at the same time reducing associated care cost. To truly incentivize different participants in the network to pro-actively create better care regimes, a
merit based compensation of shared savings (reimbursements) takes effect. In
order to effectively allocate a proportionate share to the provider in the network that contributed the most towards the overall savings, a clear tracking of
their contribution is measurable executed by smart contracts on the blockchain
network .
Another key impact of the new healthcare paradigm is the compensation
model where-in the providers are eligible for receiving additional compensation
beyond the care delivered. This compensation is the result of savings that
are generated based on how effectively the providers manage the care of the
patient’s health outcome (incentives). Any savings generated through efficient
management of the patient’s care can be retained by the providers and their
network partners as part of the shared savings aspect of the new healthcare
paradigm.
Our proposal renders the ability for payors to transfer tokens as incentives
to providers that achieve these quality metrics. The ability to seamlessly track
and manage smart contracts in which the benefits can be redeemed with significant ease provides the necessary “carrot” for providers and patients to actively
engage in a symbiotic collaboration. Contrarily, if one or more participants falters appropriate penalties, via liabilities, can also be levied with similar ease.
This “carrot/stick” approach will provide the necessary push that is needed to
shift the healthcare industry from a sickness management mindset to a wellness
lifestyle mindset.
Henceforth, Patientory issued tokens (PTOY), is the native token of the
Patientory platform. In exchange of PTOY tokens, users will be able to use the
network to rent health information storage space, and to execute health specific
smart contract payments and transactions.
We firmly believe that using a token is the best payment system to support
this infrastructure for the foreseeable future. The future is a vibrant ecosystem
of many tokens, for which healthcare will need a closed loop payment system
in place. The result will be an efficient care cycle management positive feedback loop with significant decreases in billions of dollars currently attributed to
healthcare payment fraud [4].
The system also incentives those large organizations with ample server storage to trade tokens with small to medium sized healthcare organizations that
will need direct access into the blockchain health network without directly implementing a node. Though, the new healthcare policies provide the potential
to incentivize providers to work together to improve care pathways, the current
EHR architectures come short of enabling this ability, thus, simply granting or
receiving tokens facilitates this process.
Therefore, the value of the tokens are tied to the volume of transactions
executed in the network. As the Patientory network consistently increases in
13

token transactions the demand for the token increases, resulting in increased
value.

Figure 4: Patientory Token Value as a Function of Transactions

3.7

Token Acquisition

PTOY can be acquired through Patientory’s native app, crypto-currency market
and from another patient, physician or insurer via transfer. Platform users will
have the ability to acquire PTOY by sending Ether (“ETH”) to the PTOY
creation contract on the blockchain during a pre-sale. The Patientory interface
will integrate third party trading solutions such as Shapeshift and Coinbase for
users who do not have ETH.
The Patientory Token initial distribution will be in the form of a presale.
Anyone will be able to acquire PTOY at a discount rate by pledging ETH
into the token sale smart contract. Those with other cryptocurrencies such as
ETC or BTC can create PTOY via a third-party conversion service that will be
available on the pre-sale page.
The founding team will receive a 10% allocation of PTOY, subject to a
twelve month holding period. These tokens will serve as longterm incentive
for the Patientory founding team. An additional 20% will be allocated to the
Patientory Foundation fund to be used for research and development regarding
blockchain technology for healthcare use cases.

3.8

Smart Contracts and Insurance claim processing

A. Auto-adjudication
The complexity of medical billing and the third-party reimbursement processes for patients often leads to confusion or misunderstanding between patient,
medical provider, and insurer. These complications lead some consumers to be
unaware of when, to whom, or for what amount they owe a medical bill or even
whether payment was their responsibility or the insurance provider.
Patientory is a platform engineered to leverage both Ethereum blockchain
technologies and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) compliant
application program interfaces (APIs) to increase efficiencies, enable near realtime claim adjudication, provide transparent agreements between stakeholders
and decrease fraud.
FHIR was created as an industry standard to format data thereby reducing
integration complexity for healthcare and insurance legacy systems. A key aspect to our solution, due to the cost of adding data to the blockchain, is limiting
that data to only what is needed for the smart contracts to execute.
With Billing and Insurance Related costs expected to reach 315 Billion dollars (USD) in 2018 and medical offices spending 3.8 hours each week interacting
with payers, our platform can bring substantial relief to these operational costs.

Methods that may be employed for the analysis of cross correlation for diagnostic information may also be used to analyze claim data for fraudulent activity. This analysis may also reveal actions such as drug seeking behavior due to
the instance of multiple claims. Both of these use cases add value propositions
for the use of this system by insurance companies, but the ultimate benefit is
beyond this information.
Due to the rule based system that is enforced by the smart contract system, entire coverage agreements may be encoded to smart contracts that are
referenced against end users. This would allow for a medical facility to query
the system to verify the existence of coverage prior to service delivery. The
use of the system to host cost information also allows for the automatic billing
between institutions and individuals as token based debt. Thus an institution
and an individual may be readily knowledgeable of costs as they are incurred.
This removes workload from accounting departments, thus additional value to
system adoption.
For this reason Patientory is a closed loop payment system. It
is expected that cross chain linking may even allow for the secure
exchange of value through the public Ethereum Blockchain. This
mechanism is already solved for the arbitration of Bitcoin transactions, although it does require a trusted entity to act as an Oracle.
B. Feasibility
Through the use of existing mechanisms, this architecture may be readily
constructed. One such example would be the linking of Amazon Web Service’s
HIPAA compliant data storage system with the readily deployable ErisDB.
This SAAS enables rapid deployment of an Ethereum smart contract capable blockchain with fully permissioned access controls such as those mentioned
above. The addition of the passive nodes would need to be constructed, but this
is a minimal development cost compared to the development of the complete
architecture.
With Patientory’s three-tiered Smart Contract architecture, only a subset of
the features of a smart contract are implemented on the Ethereum blockchain.
Complex business logic is removed from the execution path, which allows the
data tier to be optimized to reflect the distributed nature of the network.
The components of the smart contract package implemented on the Ethereum
blockchain are the database schema, validation and verification of transactions
that append to the ledger, and query optimization logic for reading the ledger.
The business logic is pulled up above the Ethereum blockchain to a separate
middle (business) layer. This logic code accesses a variety of services, including
secure execution, attestation, identity, cryptographic support, data formatting,
reliable messaging, triggers, and the ability to bind that code to schema in
specific smart contracts on any number of blockchains, allowing Patientory to
plug and play into various healthcare consortiums. These services are provided
in a fabric, where the individual pieces of code that support the smart contracts
can execute, send transactions to blockchain nodes, and be bound to the schema
in the data tier.

3.9

Additional Unique Benefits

Although a medical institution, such as a hospital should not have access to any
records that have not been specifically approved, by having users pre-authorize
the sharing of information under emergency circumstances, the end user could
derive additional benefit from participation in the service. With this in mind,
the need of a medical facility to access the records of an unresponsive person in
an emergency constitutes a situation that merits privilege escalation given the
user has previously authorized this access. In the event that a person is unresponsive, and has their cell phone present, the institution may prove possession
of an individual’s device by using a secondary signature method that is available from the lock screen of a smart-phone. This second key must not be the
same private key as the primary account. Thus, if an institution account submits a request to the blockchain containing the public key of an individual and
the smart-phone of that individual has submitted an emergency signature, the
blockchain may escalate privilege to allow access to medical records it would not
otherwise have access to. This private key should be considered burnable
and be replaced by the individual as soon as possible. In this manner, the secure exchange of information between an individual and
an authorized institution may be facilitated in emergency conditions.
Should an institution request this information without appropriate authorization, the individual would be notified of the actions. If the individual denies
this request within a threshold interval, the data is not shared. Further, if an
institution attempts multiple fraudulent requests, the institution may be punished by revocation of privilege, monetary punishment, and/or legal actions.
The damage caused by losing a cellular device is minimal due to the need for
both a cellular device and an institution level key. In the foreseeable future,
all insurance cards could be embedded with cryptographic micro-controllers,
such as modern credit cards possess, that would facilitate the same operation
independent of a smart phone.

4.1

National/International Health-care Priorities
Personalized Care

To achieve effective superior care, a person centric approach is important. Such
an approach should take into account not only the clinical aspects but the social
and economic factors that impede one’s ability to successfully engage in care
compliance and healthy living to yield sustained wellness.
To yield effective care outcomes requires clearly identifying the barriers of individual health and life situations. With the growing number of patients having
2+ co-morbidities, the “siloed” one-type of care fits-all care delivery approach
is not conducive in motivating and addressing effective care outcomes. Hence a
more flexible care model tailored to include patients’ multi-faceted health and
wellness needs has to be considered. This requires that a comprehensive, dynamic interactive care plan in which the patient can actively track, manage, and
16

participate in the individual’s care is vital.

4.2

Clinical Outcomes

Patient-related outcome measures (PROMs), which focus on outcomes that are
directly related to the patient, have taken on added importance and significance
over the past several years. This is due, in part, to the increased attention
focused on the patient experience of care and to provide a patient-focused assessment on the burden and impact of disease. PROMs can include symptoms
and other aspects of health –related quality of life indicators such as physical or
social function, treatment adherence, and satisfaction with treatment. They can
also facilitate more accurate patient-physician communication in terms of the
burden of treatment-related morbidities by providing a more detailed and complete evaluation of treatments for specific conditions, such as cancer or multiple
sclerosis.
PROMs are distinct from traditional clinical efficacy measures (e.g., survival
in cancer, smoking cessation) because they directly reflect the impact of disease
and its treatment from the patient’s perspective. These measures can examine
the balance between the efficiency of the treatment and its burden on the patient.
It is also effective in looking at areas such as physical functioning and overall
well-being, and highlighting the efficacy and safety of treatments in relation to
its overall clinical benefit. Because the measures themselves are developed from
the patient’s perspective, it can also facilitate greater patient involvement in
treatment decision-making as well as providing guidance for health care decisions. Essentially, reinforcing a blockchain PROM infrastructure reinforces the
ability to incentivize providers and payors in meeting care standards.

5

Conclusion

Blockchain will play an increasingly significant role in healthcare IT and bring
beneficial disruption and new efficiencies to every stakeholder in the ecosystem.
It is vitally important that healthcare organizations understand the core of
blockchain technology to ensure they are ready for the changes the technology
entails.
The result will be a new generation of powerful, blockchain-based applications that will shape the next era of business in healthcare. For blockchain to
fulfill its potential in healthcare, it must be based on standards to assure the
compatibility and interoperability within the siloed health care system landscape.

DEDICATION
This project owes its existence to the many people who have been supportive
of the concepts in the book ​Pull​, to the incredible team of volunteers at 20|30,
and to Justin Poirier, who reminded us to let our passion guide us.
Please note that this document is written in the third person because so many
people contributed to it. Thanks to all the contributors and reviewers.

SUMMARY
Twenty Thirty, a blockchain innovation company headquartered in Zug,
Switzerland, is ready to embark on one of the most ambitious decentralized
projects to-date: the personal data locker. Here is the key to everything
you’re about to read:
Wallets, browsers, and exchanges will soon merge to create the
dashboard for our digital lives.
Pillar is a platform powered by
its own native token that will
finally fulfill the promise of the
personal data locker.
Eventually, we believe this
wallet will power most devices,
including phones, tablets,
wearables, cars, buildings, and
more. This paper describes our
project to build an
open-source, multi-chain wallet
that will provide a new digital
platform for consumers,
companies, and governments.
See ​the teaser video​. We plan to realize the project in three phases:
Phase 1: ​Build the Pillar multichain wallet and get it integrated into many
systems. We want thousands of software companies to adopt our
open-source wallet.
Phase 2: ​Build integrations (exchange, browser, e-commerce, escrow,
messaging, etc.) that make it easy to build solutions.

Phase 3: ​Begin to provide the service offerings that separate our wallet
from other wallets and creates the personal data locker, leading to a
personal assistant. Continue to offer both account-based and atomic
versions (explained below). Continue to build out more features as the
ecosystem grows. Help our OEM customers transition from accounts to
atomic ownership.
At 20|30, we’re very open. We are not only asking our supporters for money,
we’re also asking them to join us on our journey. We are a grassroots
community of people working to create this future. This document ends with a
call to meet us after the crowdsale and be part of our future.

1. PROBLEM
The world economy is built on institutions that hold clients’ assets centrally:
banks, telecoms, insurance companies, brokers, drug companies,
governments, and more. Every year, hackers steal more than $400 billion and
about 1 trillion records from data centers. ​Most CIOs believe we are losing the
war on cybercrime​, even as we rely on them for more important data like
DNA, prescriptions, life logs, travel & driving history, criminal records,
algo-trading, credit scores, shopping, browsing, reputation, etc.
Our data is getting more and more concentrated in the hands of a few large
institutions. The buyers of big data love getting as much as they can from a
single vendor, so they can predict and monetize our behavior. Companies like
Facebook, Microsoft, ATT, LinkedIn, Experian, and Visa ​all exist to monetize
their users’ data​.
The European Commission’s ​Fire Study of Next Generation Internet​ recently
concluded that ...
1. Internet should ensure citizens' sovereignty over their
own data and protect privacy;
2. Internet should ensure diversity, pluralism and a right
to choose; and
3. Internet should avoid the concentration of data in a
few proprietary platforms.
4. Personal Data Spaces was seen as a very important
technology area for all the above top ranked values.

This is the problem the Pillar project will address. We want to give people a
better, safer digital experience. We have two main objectives:
Replace accounts with atomic ownership. ​We all have dozens of
accounts. With accounts, you log in and all your valuable data is
trapped inside the app or the service. This presents huge concentration
risk. It’s easier to get a divorce than to change banks or stock brokers.
By switching from accounts to wallets, each person owns his/her own
assets and can switch between vendors freely.
Replace apps with services. ​Apps on our phones are miniature
desktop apps. Many of us have dozens of logins for apps that don’t talk
to each other. We believe that the personal data locker will replace iOS
and Android to become the operating system for all your devices.
These two changes will radically transform the way we use data. Do
consumers care? Not as much as they should. But they are starting to, and
governments are helping​. As ​the EU and other jurisdictions adopt strict data
privacy and portability standards​, the current paradigm will have to change.
The decentralization movement and technologies like blockchain will lead to a
fundamental paradigm shift, putting people in control of their digital lives.

2. SOLUTION: THE PERSONAL DATA LOCKER
David Siegel created the concept of the personal
data locker in early 2000 and ​published a book
about it in 2010​. There is an associated vision
video, which you can see here:

Personal Data Locker Vision
Today, we have the technology to make the
personal data locker a reality: blockchains. In
this world, you hold your assets in your own
secure wallet, making it difficult and unprofitable
to attack.
The Pillar wallet is our solution. It will be a
consumer product that looks very much like
today’s digital wallets, but it is just the very beginning of the personal data
locker. We will transform the wallet experience from something you use
occasionally to trade currencies to something you use most of the time as you
go about your day.
We believe that browsers and wallets will converge, and that combination just
happens to describe the personal data locker. The Pillar wallet will let you
manage everything you own, everything you have, everything you want,
everything you consume, and everything you do online.

Key Terms
Atomic ownership​ of private keys means that personal data, currencies, and
assets are not held or controlled by any third party. Only you have the keys to
this data. If you lose your keys, your data or value is lost (there are several
ways to help consumers manage their keys safely).
Accounts​ involve logging in and creating an account with a company you must
trust to back up and safeguard your data, including credit-card info,
passwords, etc.. If your account is compromised, you lose your data, identity,
or value.

The ecosystem as described in David’s book is just starting. Many groups will
build pieces that incrementally fit together. Having seen many such projects
come and go over the years, we are well aware what it takes to succeed. But
first …

3. UNDERSTANDING CONSUMER RESISTANCE
We have been in the personal-data space for many years. Our biggest
challenge isn’t technical, it’s consumer behavior.

3.1 Two Immutable Laws
The following two graphs show why very little progress has been made over
the past twenty years:

As contributors to the World Economic Forum report, ​Personal Data: The
Emergence of a New Asset Class​, and part of the identity community for many
years, we believe these are immutable laws that will not bend or change for
anyone. Our biggest barrier is that most people don’t perceive any problem.

3.2 Solutions, not Tools
But that is not the right way to look at it. We have been trying to give
consumers tools, when we should be giving them solutions. Now that we
understand how to work with blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and tokens, we
can start to give consumers a much better experience. A few g ood indicators:

Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

10

The Lykke wallet and exchange​ ​is an easy-to-use mobile app that
looks like a familiar trading app but keeps all customer assets on the
phone itself.
The Brave browser​ is an open-source browser, that will make it easy
to spend or tip for content as you browse, eliminating middlemen.
The Token App​ is a mobile browser with global payments built in.
Sovrin​ is a blockchain-based, permissioned identity system with a
growing group of developers.
Civic​ is a secure identity platform that will soon use its own tokens.
U-Port​ ​is an identity and reputation system you create yourself.
The Internet of People​ is an open-source stack for managing identity
and reputation.
Identity and ​reputation​ have been sticking points in the adoption of the
personal data locker. Blockchain technology is changing that. There are many
upcoming systems for ​preserving privacy​ and increasing ​scalability​. We don’t
plan to choose sides - we will incorporate anything that gets traction.
We know consumers don’t want to work with their own data, but that doesn’t
mean they don’t want to own it. They do want to own it, but they don’t want
the hassle of managing it. They want a software system that does it for them:
●
●

●

●

●
●

When they visit the doctor, they want the paperwork to take care of
itself.
When they drive their car (or their car drives them), they want the data
to go to their personal data locker, not to the manufacturer’s web site
for another siloed log-in.
When they have an airplane ticket and their plans change, they want
their locker to extend their hotel reservation, sell their ticket and buy a
new one.
People want their investment portfolio to manage itself according to
their wishes, not deal with accounts, sales people, and limited
selection.
When looking for a new job, they want jobs to come to them, rather
than having to send applications.
The weather forecast can automatically tell their home or building to
prepare for a storm, without them having to do anything manually.

Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

●
●

People want their reputation, (KYC package), attestations, and history
to go with them whenever they want to use a new service.
If it’s easy, people want systems that give out only as much
information as necessary to complete a transaction, not more. So you
can order things online and the stores don’t even know your address,
and you can say where the package should go, even if you’re on the
road.

If the system lets them own their own data and their software does the work
for them, people will stop trusting big institutions to do it, because ​that​ will be
more of a hassle. It’s all about the hassle factor.
It ​has​ to be hassle-free. We need to bring a combination of blockchain, AI,
chatbots, and smart interfaces to create an easy-to-use solution.

3.3 Market
With the personal data locker, we are going after a much larger market than
the “native crypto market” - people who want to use smart contracts for
everything. Our markets are technology early adopters and cryptocurrency
early majority.

We will start with early adopters and work our way toward the much larger
early-majority segments later. Customer acquisition will be a mix of retail,
partner, and OEM strategies. With the open-source Pillar wallet as a
foundation, and with further data-protection and consumer-protection
Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

12

legislation a certainty, we plan to flip the old paradigm of control/push to a
new world of response/pull.
In aiming this product at advanced consumers, we aren’t forgetting the
corporate and white-label (OEM) markets. We will provide our wallet through
many software companies, banks, wealth-management firms, and more. It
will be easy to integrate with their existing systems.

4. THE PILLAR WALLET
In case you haven’t seen or used a wallet, you can watch David’s ​video tour of
the Lykke wallet​ to see one in action. In essence, a wallet is software that
holds the private keys to your assets sitting on a blockchain. You transact by
“signing” orders. The Pillar wallet will hold keys and let you transact with
many blockchains, and it will eventually be the control panel you use to
interact with the digital world.

Using a wallet, there is no account.
You hold the private keys to your
cryptocurrency (bitcoin, ether, etc.)
and you use cryptocurrencies or
digital tokens to “pay as you go,”
for the service using
micropayments. The service may
never know who you are. This is
what the Brave browser will do.
This is how people will pay for
many services in the future. You can think of tokens as tradable API keys.

4.1 What is the Pillar Wallet?
There are many cryptocurrency wallets already. The Pillar wallet will be …
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Multi-chain: able to see hundreds of kinds of tokens and coins.
Open source.
Not tied to any one browser.
Not tied to any one exchange - you can choose your exchange.
Easy for software companies to incorporate into their systems.
Both on desktop and mobile.
Stand-alone and OEM.

The wallet comes in two basic versions:
●

An account-based wallet​ that lets the user see his/her coins and
tokens. This would be similar to what CoinBase recently provided to
Fidelity. We wouldn’t offer this wallet directly but through OEM
companies who want this wallet for compatibility with their
account-based systems.

Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

14

●

An atomic version​ that gives the user full control of her assets. This is
similar to the Lykke wallet today but independent of any exchange.

The Pillar wallet is not an exchange. ​Token​, which has a built-in exchange, is
an excellent example of how wallets, exchanges, and browsers are
converging. The ​Jaxx wallet​, which has already integrated many blockchains,
and ​the Lykke wallet​, have many assets, but they won’t focus on our
personal-assistant functionality.
We expect to partner with several exchanges. In fact, we want Pillar users to
put their buy/sell orders into our API and let exchanges compete for their
business. This solves the liquidity problem: any order can now be filled from
any exchange that participates in the network. The Pillar token is a
meta-token, and the Pillar exchange is a meta-exchange.
The Pillar wallet isn’t a browser - a browser is based on search and push, like
the web is today. Even Siri mostly brings you search results in a browser. We
believe browsing will eventually become asking and requesting, and the
information will come to you.
As the Pillar ecosystem emerges, these functions will converge, and we’ll
provide these services to many other platforms …
The internet of smart contracts is an internet
of offers. Our wallet will find and interact
with smart contracts. We will help industries
reformat their data so our wallet can see it
(the pillar token provides the incentive).
We believe the wallet will be the center of
your world. Everything will tie into the
wallet, and we’ll use fewer and fewer apps.
Eventually, we’ll stop calling it a wallet and
call it the Pillar personal data locker.

4.2 Integrations
In the next phase, we will create and/or partner with other companies to
provide ...
Multi-exchange support​ is important, because many of the use cases for
the system require an exchange. We plan to partner with one or more

Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

15

exchanges that will plug into our open-source system. As our network grows,
we will create more competition and tighter spreads.
Smart contract aware​ is a new frontier of findability in the web of value. It’s
possible today to invoke a smart contract and send it ether, but finding the
smart contracts in the first place is getting to be more and more of a
challenge. This “searching the web of value” will take some work, but we are
inspired by the ​Userfeeds​ and ​ether ontology​ projects.
A fiat exchange​ that interfaces to the banking system requires licenses. We
will look for partners who want to provide these exchange services to our
platform.
Portfolio and wealth management​ will integrate your coin- and
token-based holdings, give you investing and risk-management tools,
investment advice​, and secure your assets while making sure you have the
petty cash to spend as you like.
Shopping services ​that work with ecommerce sites accepting
cryptocurrencies, will be integrated.
Identity services ​will be provided by several different standards. We plan to
integrate all of them, so people can easily plug into the system and bring their
identity with them. People will likely use more than one identity system, so
they can have different personas in the personal data locker.
Messaging and social sharing​ are already being done by several groups,
most of them are open source. We will integrate one or more of these.
Job matching​ - we expect to offer a revolutionary new job and freelance
matching engine.
Search​ - find offers on the web of value and bring them back.
People search​ - find others and connect your various social graphs.
Calendars and scheduling services​ that interact with today’s most popular
calendars. Ties into various professional schedulers.
Smart contract control center ​shows all your obligations, escrow, assets,
and is tied to your calendar, balance sheet, and other parts to give you a
complete smart-contract management system.
Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

16

All our wallets and extensions will be open-source. Many apps will be free or
open-source, and many apps will have subscription or pay-as-you-go models.
In all cases, you own and control your own assets - no one else has access to
them. Open source is the only way to do this - our token (described later)
provides the business model to make the Pillar ecosystem come to life.

4.3 Personal Data Locker Services
Once the basic extensions are in place, we can start creating vertical
solutions. Here is a sample of the services we expect, many of which are
described in ​Pull​:
●

Classified ads, auctions, and barter exchange
Peer-to-peer currency exchange

Finding employment
Finding an apartment to buy or rent
Digital birth certificate ecosystem for products
Etc.

These aren’t what you may be thinking. On your phone or desktop today,
these are separate apps. They barely talk with each other. The personal data
locker is a world of pull, where you say what you’re looking for, and the offers
and information come to you. You can have long-standing requests that
match when the appropriate find is made, or short-term requests that
immediately result in a number of offers to choose from. We will focus on
bringing in content and offers. We don’t think of it as a browser, we think of it
as a personal data locker as described in ​Pull​. Everything is on your terms no apps, no web sites, no ads (unless you want ads).

4.4 Stack
As the wallet grows into the personal data locker, it will have more and more
layers of standards, services, and features. For example, you may have
different personas that you can use in different modes and maintain privacy.
You may integrate many features with other members of your family or work.
Our stack isn’t completely fleshed out yet, but here is a general idea ...

4.5 White-Label Wallets
We don’t have an exchange. We don’t have a browser. Therefore, we can
provide our wallet to many companies’ software systems, either to add
cryptocurrencies to their current capabilities, or to help them transition to
atomic ownership of assets. We will provide a white-label wallet any company
can put their own logo on or integrate into their own system. We will focus on
the extra services you get with our wallet that you don’t get with other
wallets. We hope this will entice many software companies to use our wallet
and get their clients using Pillar tokens.

4.6 Transition to Atomic Ownership
For a long time, we will support both account-based and atomic-based
wallets. The look and feel should be almost the same. As more and more
people are comfortable transitioning to the atomic wallet, the customer
experience will be easy. Rather than logging into a centralized service, you’ll
establish your password and make sure it’s backed up or shared with people
you trust. From there on, your assets will be fully under your control.
We expect atomic ownership will be attractive to our OEM and white-label
customers, both because it will be better for customers and because
regulators will push them along this path.
The wallet is the new operating system​ - a few people have figured this out
already, but it’s still early days in the race. The wallet is everything - in ten
years our wallets will become digital assistants, powered by voice, gesture,
data, and artificial intelligence. The wallet is the new platform that will power
phones, cars, glasses, tablets, interactive displays, and more. Wear your
Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

wallet on your finger or wrist and get instant access to everything. This space
is going to innovate quickly, and we plan to be part of it. The Pillar wallet may
be just the right thing at the right time.

4.7 Private Key and Password Management
If you own your own data, you are responsible for safeguarding it. There are
many ways we will help consumers do this. There are also plenty of ​hardware
solutions​. Eventually, we’ll use rings, watches, bracelets, even chip implants
to verify who we are. We plan to give consumers many options.

5. THE PILLAR TOKEN
The native utility token for this system, the pillar, will be necessary for the
system to function and will be independent of any cryptocurrency. It will be
an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be a unit of value within
our system.

5.1 What does the Pillar Token Do?
While the wallet and platform are open-source and free, users will pay for the
various services with pillar tokens (PLRs) as they use them. The token will
power the entire ecosystem, giving an instant business model to many
projects that can tie in. This is the beauty of a token: you may need a service
exactly once and you won’t need to sign up for it, you’ll just pay in pillars and
you’re done.
Many services will be free. For example, most exchanges don’t charge a fee,
they take their fees from the money you’re exchanging. Many more will be
ad-driven, and you’ll be in charge of the ads you see. Importantly, you’ll be
able to “monetize yourself” by asking for offers and providing yourself as a
lead to marketers.
Here’s an example: you go see your doctor, she does some tests and gives
you a prescription for some pills. All the data from that visit, and the
prescription, will be copied to your wallet. Your data can even go to a study
being done - with your permission, and even though you’re anonymous in the
study, if they want to send you a message, you’ll have a choice of receiving it.
Another example: You book a hotel room and rent a car. These are now smart
contracts. They require deposits and some kind of insurance token. The Pillar
wallet handles all these details for you, managing all your smart-contract
obligations, deposits, refunds, etc.
Looking for a new bike? Just specify what you want, using our product
taxonomy or chatbot, and all the bikes that fit that description come to you
for sorting and viewing. The data will come from each source, rather than
from aggregators. You don’t see web sites, you see offers.
More and more services will accept pillars. The average person may pay
$20-$40 per year in such services, and in return be in total control of her
assets and ad exposure. The money goes directly to service providers - we
don’t take a cut.

Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

20

We will likely integrate the Brave browser​, so you can use the browser’s
built-in token to pay for content as you consume it. We may integrate other
browsers.
We expect to integrate one or more exchanges.​ It should be easy to pay
for what you want, using whatever currency you like. We plan to make it so
you can pay in pillars for everything. We will partner with several exchanges,
so you can plug in the one you want or use the exchange that’s right for each
transaction. Long-term, we plan to create an exchange marketplace, where
exchanges bid for your transaction in real time.
We don’t have a set scheme for fees. We believe market forces will keep fees
low. Fees will be flexible, possibly like bitcoin’s auction system. Since there
will be competition, you will always see the best market rate for services and
low fees.

5.2 The Pillar Token is a Meta-Token
Brave has a native token for seeing customized ads and monetizing your
browsing experience. Augur has a token for betting. Akasha has one for
messaging. Civic has a token for identity. All these tokens will be native in our
system one level below the Pillar token. Users may only ever use Pillar tokens,
and the system handles all the various tokens needed to do what they want.
Or they may see and use the various utility tokens directly.
So there are five possible levels people may see:
●
●
●
●
●

Fiat currencies only - they will see no tokens at all, even though there
are many tokens at work. It will look and feel more like an account.
Just whatever cryptocurrency they happen to like, or a mix.
A combination of fiat currency, cryptocurrencies, and pillars.
A combination of fiat, pillars, and the native tokens for each service.
Possibly no fiat currency at all - only tokens and cryptocurrencies.

In a reverse way, the pillar token could be used to feed payments in from
around the web. A vendor or individual may offer something for sale
(consulting time, fidget spinners, hotel rooms), and buyers can buy in any
currency they like, but the vendor can be paid in pillars (or any other
cryptocurrency). So pillars are the basic fungible unit of value between all
these systems.

5.3 Marketing & Partnerships
Ask anyone who has created a successful platform — it’s every bit as much
about communication and education as it is about building a quality service.
There are hundreds of wallets on the market. We believe the Pillar token will
be the viral component. The more companies integrate their services and use
our token, the more it becomes a standard, and the more people will want it.
We plan to dedicate serious resources to education, marketing, and
communications. We want the open-source Pillar wallet to be ubiquitous.
We will have a partnership program to help developers and others integrate
our wallet into their software.

5.4 Governance
Token governance is ​more complex than many people realize​. The personal
data locker will become part of hundreds of millions of people’s lives, and the
Pillar token will be making things work. As there are a fixed number of tokens
after the ICO, market forces will determine prices and behavior. However,
anyone with a large supply of pillars will be able to move markets and
influence policy. Therefore, we plan to take stewardship of this token very
seriously and watch for any potential issues that need attention. This is a new
area of commerce. Most open-source projects have governing bodies, but
they don’t have to think about tokens. We hope to show the way forward in
token governance and teach other groups what we have learned.
The biggest risk is forking. As we have seen with the Ethereum project, a hard
fork is a very serious event in the life of a system. Regarding splits, our goal
is to create a self-healing system and have a governance council that will take
all stakeholders into account when making decisions.
There are small things we can do to manage the token’s fiscal and monetary
policies. We could be market makers, we can purchase tokens, and we can
burn or ice tokens. We will be very transparent about our plans and include all
stakeholders in our discussions.

6. EXECUTION PLAN
This section describes the methodology, not the specific solutions. At a
fundamental level, the Pillar system represents the convergence of the
semantic web and the web of value. The combination is far more powerful
than the two separately. Eventually, we will add AI to make the customer
experience easy and intuitive.

6.1 Team Building
We don’t believe in resumes or interviews. We have a community approach to
building the necessary team for all our projects. You may not see the usual
experts on our team - though we have many. Our approach is to invite people
to work with us and see who is aligned with our purpose. Much of the team
building for this project will take place at our summer event in August.
In general, we prefer creative generalists who can go with the flow than
specialists who can only see a narrow problem and narrow solution. We will
hire mostly generalists and hire specialists as consultants.
Want to be part of it? Come to Slovakia in August and you probably will be.

6.2 Architecture
We don’t have a set architecture for our wallet. We plan to keep building and
modifying, throw away code as it gets out of date, and stay market-focused in
delivering small units that work. We first have to build the world’s best
open-source multi-chain wallet as the “trunk” then keep adding as we have
partners and use cases that drive adoption.

6.3 Foundation: Collaboration
We plan to work with several projects we know well and have code we can
start with. We plan to meet and collaborate with everyone in our space. A few
notable projects:

There are others. We are coming from the wallet side. We will have many
options to choose from as we build a community of contributors and partners
for the Pillar project.

6.4 Data Conversion
To transition from apps and web sites, the right data and content must flow in
and out of the personal data locker. This is a huge job - the more you
understand it, the more you see how big the project is. Fortunately, as David
mentions in his book, we can use existing vocabularies, taxonomies, and ​APIs
to bring data in and understand it. The state of the art in AI and big data have
reached a point where it is commercially feasible to work with unformatted
data and reformat it to suit our purposes - this can be seen by the fact that
Google can now tell you whether a store or restaurant is open just after you
type in its name. We are just now at a point where the personal data locker
can make sense of much of the data online.
We will take it one use case at a time and incentivize many partners, who will
want to be paid in pillars. David’s book ​and his recent essay on smart data
describe many of the details.

6.5 Digital Birth Certificates
A chapter in ​Pull​ describes the digital birth certificate - a digital identifier for
every individual person, animal, and item on earth. This is not a new concept.
There are plenty of systems already identifying individual items (as opposed
to a class of items) and their condition and location.
The Internet of Things is bringing to life the concepts outlined in David’s book.
Everything will have a unique identifier, and that identifier will point to its
description, and that description will have a place on some blockchain to
create ​the economy of things​. We will start integrating these new systems and
continue to support the standardization of data in this area.

6.6 Data Security
All the current development around blockchain-based data involves atomic
ownership. This is a very active area of research and development. The Pillar
Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

24

wallet will become the hub for people to aggregate and use their own data.
Data storage options include:
●
●
●
●

Decentralized storage
On blockchain
On the user’s device
In datacenters

All these options already have methods for hashing, storing, managing, and
retrieving data. Increased requirements for data privacy and protection will
accelerate adoption of the personal data locker. The personal data locker is
just the right solution at the right time.
A key concept is the principle of ​least privilege​: giving out just the information
necessary to consummate a transaction. Today, consumers give out far too
much information, leading to the problems we have outlined above. Your
personal data locker will help you manage this process. In many cases, we
can use proxies that prevent vendors from capturing so much personal data,
including physical addresses. This is a new ecosystem of trusted and trustless
partners and data providers. It’s already growing. The personal data locker
will give it much needed momentum.

7. FINANCIALS
While most white papers are very light on financial projections, we want to
explain our thinking.

7.1 Use of Proceeds
We are well aware of the difficulties of large-scale software development and
the failure of most projects to communicate and document clearly what has
been produced. We will need to evangelize and promote our wallet, get as
many customers to use it as possible, and explain the value of the token to
people many times. This project will have its own P&L, which will be available
on the project’s web site and updated monthly. The team will be based in
London to start. This is an agile business. We can’t know or plan how things
will work out. We will have to launch and learn. For that reason, many
parameters of this ecosystem are left intentionally unspecified.

7.2 The Planning Fallacy
It would be great if we could script each month of the next five years and
connect the dots to success. Every new venture is a lottery ticket, a chance to
build a network that may or may not materialize. Most won’t. Too many
Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

25

project plans suffer from overprecision. We keep Eric Schmidt, chairman of
Alphabet’s words in mind:

“One of the biggest reasons for our success, though, is that the plan we
delivered to the board that day in 2003 wasn’t much of a plan at all. There
were no financial projections or discussions of revenue streams. There was
no market research on what users, advertisers, or partners wanted or how
they fit into nicely defined market segments. There was no concept of
market research or discussion of which advertisers we would target first.
[…] We left that out for the simple reason we didn’t know how we were
going to do it.”
That said, it’s worth the exercise to get started. Here is our proposed budget
for five years, realizing that we will learn as we go.

7.3 Budget
Any budget or forecast is a work of fiction. Given the magnitude of the
project, we believe these numbers are realistic and conservative. We are here
to change the world. If we are doing OEM deals, we could double these
numbers:

Pillar Personal Data Locker Gray Paper

26

7.4 Beyond Budgeting
What we know from start-up data is that running out of cash is one of the
number one causes of failure (for the other three causes, see ​David’s talk on
entrepreneurship​). All companies should do rolling, agile forecasts and
budgets, as described in the amazing book, ​Future Ready​, by Steve Morlidge
and Steve Player.
With that in mind, we believe that to create the world’s most powerful, most
successful wallet takes a combination of spirit, persistence, skill, cash, and
luck. We will have to spend smart and work hard to promote and evangelize
the Pillar system. We can’t be too specific on how the next several years will
play out.
We will use rolling forecasts as a tool and teach other start-ups how to apply
Beyond Budgeting principles​ to their projects.

7.5 Money Management
We expect to raise enough money for five years. We plan to diversify our
holdings. We will purchase ​our own index tokens​, to help diversify. We also
plan to participate in the pre-sale of projects that will fit into the Pillar system.
This will be a small portion of our holdings, but it should help create an
ecosystem around the personal data locker.

7.6 Transparency
We will put all financials and progress on our web site and update it once a
month. We will post a financial report once a quarter. Our Slack is open - feel
free to come ask questions.

8. ABOUT 20|30
Twenty Thirty AG is a corporation based in Zug, Switzerland, founded in
January 2017. It is David Siegel’s 22nd company. We don’t believe in boards
of directors (​been there, done that​). We don’t believe in community voting
unless it’s done very carefully (​voting is easily skewed​). We believe in getting
actively involved, discussing, making agile, rolling decisions as we go. We
have a strong bias for open-source and running code. We expect to run
internship programs, give grants, do pro-bono projects, create educational
materials, sponsor or run events, work with city and national governments,
and partner with other companies and institutions to spread the principles and
tools of decentralization around the world. The Pillar project is our flagship
project. We’re here to change the world.

8.1 Culture
No matter how much money we raise, we will always adhere to our guiding
principles (laid out in an essay called ​The Culture Deck​):
● HOW matters.
● Stay lean - no fat salaries, no fancy offices, set up a dorm for people to
sleep in when they come work with us.
● Work in the same room as much as possible.
● Take care of each other, build a family culture. Employees first,
customers second.
● We don’t look at resumes and we don’t interview. We work with
volunteers until they are ready to transition to part-time, and then
full-time employment. ​Culture fit is more important than skill.​ We can
teach skills. ​We want friendly, eager people who are willing to do what
it takes.
● No HR, no management, no board, no traditional business beliefs.
Measure everything, try new things, learn what works.
● Continuous delivery in one-week cycles. Keep the code working.
● Continuous improvement - make things better every day.
● Use ​Kanban​ - make ​Kanban​ your religion. Create joy at work.
● Invite everyone to join us. Our community is our foundation.
● Give to the crypto community. We plan to give research grants, do free
events, publish, and more.
● Communicate, communicate, communicate. Don’t underestimate what
it takes to get people to learn and try something new.
20|30 has no management structure and no hierarchy. Our model is that of a
hive, with people doing what they love to do and swarming to solve problems.
Join us.

9. CROWDSALE
The Pillar crowdsale will take place over 60 hours, from 8am GMT on
Saturday, July 15 to 8pm GMT on Monday, July 17. During this time, the price
will be fixed in ether. In fact, the actual time of the sale will be measured in
blocks, not minutes, and our web site will keep an updated count of blocks
with an estimated time until the sale ends - it should be between 59 and 61
hours. We will put the price on the web site on July 14, so people can plan
their allocations.
Each token will be an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain — we will use
a smart contract and return tokens to the buyer’s ether address. In the case
of not meeting our minimum, we will return ether instead.
Refer to the Terms and Conditions document for final details. This is a
summary ...

9.1 Token Allocation
A total of 800 million tokens will be issued. This is how it breaks down in
dollars during planning - the actual price in ether is subject to change (blue
means an input):
8 July 2017​: We had to reallocate 42 million tokens from the sale to the
presale as a result of overwhelming demand. Figures below are current:

The presale​ will take place using a smart contract and an ether address that
will be sent with instructions by email and may or may not be on a web page.
The presale is limited to 48 million tokens. Several of the people working on
the project will be purchasing at this time. Price per token has not yet been
set.
The token sale ​will offer 528,000,000 tokens to the public. They will be sold
using a smart contract until all 528 million have been sold, or 60 hours,
whichever comes first. The price will be set in ether. Buyers will receive
ERC20 tokens at the conclusion of the sale.
All unsold tokens from both the presale and the sale​ will immediately go
on ice for ten years using a smart contract. They can’t be touched during that
time. We expect they will be transferred to a nonprofit that will govern the
tokens before then, but until that time they will remain property of 20|30.
After ten years, they may be sold, re-iced, or burned according to our
token-management directives, which will evolve along with the system.
The minimum raise for presale and sale combined​ will be around $8
million, set ahead of the sale and priced in ether (approximately 80 million
tokens).
The target ​is roughly $30 million at the sale-time ether price.
The cap​ will be 560 million tokens.
The marketing effort will receive 24 million tokens, or 3 percent. ​This
is to pay all the people and companies who have worked so hard to create
and manage the token sale. 1 percent of these tokens will be tradable
immediately — they are bounty and contest rewards. The other two percent
will be locked up for 9 months after the sale ends.
We reserve the right to use some or all of ​the 15 percent of tokens
reserved for later funding​ as follows:
1. To provide liquidity ​on one or more exchanges. Tokens not being
used for liquidity will be “off the market.”
2. To give to people​ who will develop services for our system.
3. To offer them as prizes​ in contests to help expand the system with
innovative services.
4. For future offerings. ​Assuming a strong initial sale, we don’t plan
another offering for at least three years. If we reach our cap, we will
freeze all these tokens for three years.

5. We may burn or ice tokens ​if we feel that it contributes positively to
the ecosystem.
The ten percent of tokens reserved for Twenty Thirty ​will be dedicated
to funding projects that will be built on top of the Pillar system. We will give
them to developers to develop parts that will work with the system. We’ll use
them to fund our own projects. They will be an asset of the corporation. These
tokens will go on ice for three years.

9.2 Token Sale
The sale will take place over 60 hours, beginning on July 15 at 08:00 GMT.
Tokens will be priced immediately before the sale in ether. The sale will take
place at that fixed price over 60 hours (measured in blocks on the Ethereum
blockchain) or until all 560 million are sold. There will be no discounts. At the
end, all unsold public tokens will be put on ice for ten years, as described
above.

9.3 Token Trading
We expect to list our tokens on an exchange as soon as possible after the
close of the crowdsale. We will put this information on our web site as soon as
it is available.

10. SUMMER EVENT
Pillar is a big project. We’re in it for the long run. We are very serious about
involving everyone who is interested in working with us. We don’t care about
your education or resume or interview skills. We invite you to come work with
us.
We have no intention of squandering the money we acquire in our
crowdfunding event. We treat every ether as if it were our own. After the
crowdfunding, we plan to have a grass-roots unconference at ​AquaCity in
Poprad, Slovakia​, to socialize, learn, teach, plan, and hire. Anyone who comes
to Poprad in early August is probably a person we want to hire. Every
morning, we will have blockchain learning and Pillar planning sessions. We will
have tracks for central services, product, and marketing. If you are reading
this, you are welcome to join us.
The event will take place from 29 July to 6 August. Direct flights from London
are available. We have reserved 19 rooms, but they are going fast and people
are finding roommates. Rooms are very limited for the resort, but there are
hotel rooms not far away. We’ll be working in the mornings and trying not to
work in the afternoons. It’s a family event - bring your kids. Big party on
Friday the 4th. To reserve your room, contact ​Tomer@2030.io​. Don’t wait for
our ICO - rooms are going fast. Contact Tomer now to get one.

In September 2017, we plan to open London’s first open blockchain
innovation center. It won’t be fancy, but it will be a community center where
people can collaborate to build the Pillar wallet. We also plan to rent a few
small flats that will become our dorm, where people can stay while they work
with us for weeks or months.

eToken
1. eToken Contract as a basis for Polybius Token (PLBT)
PLBT is a token issued within an eToken1 contract. There will be 20 000 000 Polybius tokens
created for the ICO. No further PLBT will be generated a�er this phase of the project and all the
unsold tokens will be destroyed.
eToken is an Ethereum smart contract, wri�en using Solidity2 programming language by
Ambisafe3. It enables issuance of tokens in Ethereum network and provides a rich set of features:
1. Implementa�on of ICAP4 for mul�-layer transac�on rou�ng
2. Account recovery for the lost key scenario
3. Allowances
4. Automa�c ethereum network fee refunds
5. Integrated exchange with Ether currency
6. Ability to set transac�on fees
eToken also implements EIP205, also known as Standardized Contract API. EIP20 compa�bility
ensures that integra�on with exchanges and other services will be no harder than for any other
Ethereum-based token.

The dividends distribu�on process consists of two stages: ge�ng the accurate data about the
PLBT distribu�on among users (dividends report) and spreading the company proﬁt among the
tokenholders.
Dividends report
To have a proof of PLBT ownership by exact addresses, Polybius will make Snapshots of Blockchain
prior each dividends distribu�on using a specially developed tool named Dividends Report. It
allows to capture the current state of tokens distribu�on among investors as on the exact block.
The number of the milestone block as well as an approximate date and �me of its appearance will
be announced in advance both, by email and at the Polybius Website.
Distribu�on of the proﬁt
Polybius Founda�on ﬁnancial management undertakes to transfer 20% of the company

dividends distribu�on will be announced in advance at Polybius Bank Website. Also users will be
no�ﬁed via email twice.
In order to receive their share of dividends, users will be required to return PLBT tokens to the
Polybius Wallet or any other wallet which supports the dividends payment mode in case, if they
have been stored outside of it. The list of such wallets will be announced at the Polybius Website.
Polybius is nego�a�ng with all major exchanges regarding implementa�on of the dividends
accep�ng func�onality. Polybius will inform customers whenever this feature will be available at
any of them.
A Dividends distribu�on smart contract is designed to distribute proﬁt among the investors
according to their stakes. All the payments will be made in ETH. Dividends will be sent to those
addresses whose PLBT token ownership will be proved by Snapshot of Blockchain.

Abstract
PRO is a decentralized cryptocurrency not only focused on disrupting
an industry but focused on disrupting commerce, the way we exchange
goods and services. We are taking what may seem overly complicated
to the masses by making cryptocurrency simple to use and understand.
In commerce, consumers and businesses can be introduced to
cryptocurrency through rewards reserved to incentivize them to start
using cryptocurrency in their everyday life.
The fact is, in traditional retail commerce, there is heavy emphasis on
oﬀering rebates, cash back, and incentives for shopping at a speciﬁc
store. We believe this principle should also be true for cryptocurrency.
Our plan is a simple and unique strategy that will shift the way people
in general use cryptocurrency in commerce.
We have a vision that extends beyond what the normal cryptocurrency
user is accustomed to. Our vision is to take the essence of
cryptocurrency and expose it to the world, presenting it in a way they
have never seen before. We feel that cryptocurrency has become a
cycle of projects trying to push the boundaries by having diﬀerent ideas
and technologies however not thinking outside of the box.
We have a diﬀerent perspective and approach compared to other
developers, we need to be aggressive, we need to be proactive and we
need to make a real diﬀerence. We have a strategic plan that has never
been implemented in crypto before and we are conﬁdent that our
vision will become a reality.
We believe PRO is an innovative project that is extremely viable and
needed in the marketplace.

1. Introduction
Through PRO’s platforms, people will learn and see the value of
cryptocurrency, along with blockchain technology without it seeming
overly complicated to a new user.
In the past, cryptocurrencies have mainly appealed to people
possessing a strong technology background as well as those that are
experienced speculators. Up until now, there has not been a
cryptocurrency that has been able to overcome the challenge of
inﬂuencing the masses to accept and use cryptocurrency in their
everyday life. Bitcoin has done a phenomenal job by laying the
foundation and paving the way however mainstream consumers still
have not fully caught on.
PRO’s vision will catapult this particular coin to become a mainstream
currency by incentivizing consumers to use the coin and merchants to
accept the coin.
Over the last 7 years, it's been very diﬃcult for people to accept the
change that cryptocurrency has brought to our society. Cryptocurrency
seems confusing to most people because they are uneducated on the
subject so they end up only using ﬁat currency. Most of the developers
of cryptocurrencies do not create a coin with the mindset of educating
the population or utilizing marketing strategies like marketing and
advertising agencies to attract the average person.
How does a new company market and bring brand awareness? They
oﬀer incentives to those that try their products. The company is looking
to build trust and create greater brand awareness by using proven
incentive models.
Examples: try before you buy, 50% oﬀ ﬁrst order, and buy 1 get 1 free.
Up until now there is not a cryptocurrency that has been created to
incentivize the masses to want to learn or use cryptocurrency.

Creating something for free is a great way to generate momentum and
engagement. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, help
make people feel comfortable to accept the global shift that the
internet has created. Online shopping has become more convenient
and acceptable to the public compared to a decade ago. [1]
When the internet launched, many people focused on how they could
make money with their website and how they could leverage the
internet to sell products. Companies like Yahoo and MySpace did not
focus on what to sell, instead they oﬀered useful platforms to the world
for free and brought great awareness to the internet.
They both failed to listen to the demands of the consumer. Yahoo
throttled search results, they were on a hunt for “stickiness” which is an
early term for keeping people on the search page so you could serve
ads. Myspace had a corporate business plan and did not listen to
suggestions from their audience.
Then Google arrived, providing lightning fast search results, a tactic
which other search engines feared would cause users to leave the site
too quickly. [2] Facebook transformed social media and built a platform
oﬀ of listening to the requests of the users and allowing white space
management. This is something MySpace failed at due to their
pre-written business plans. [3] Both companies kept free platforms
focused speciﬁcally for users not for businesses. As a result, both users
and businesses beneﬁted and Google and Facebook became staples in
the everyday life of millions.
Our desire here at PRO is to take on the challenge of helping people
understand and learn how to use cryptocurrency in their everyday
lives. The best way to do that is to apply proven incentivized strategies
and oﬀer something of tremendous value for free.

2. Applications Designed for Mass Adoption
An application being free and simple is not enough, there needs to be
innovation that solves problems and challenges. PRO has a two-phase
approach to overcoming obstacles in the minds of consumers and
businesses by oﬀering incentives so that cryptocurrency may become a
part of everyday life.
The sole purpose of this phase is to attract the masses, capture their
attention and raise the awareness of cryptocurrency beyond the
“underground” status. This will be accomplished through two
applications, one for consumers and the other for businesses.
2.1 Phase 1 - Incentives and Rewards
Phase 1 is a gateway for the masses to adopt cryptocurrency into their
everyday life through rewards. Consumers and businesses both need
to be incentivized in order to be open to incorporating cryptocurrency
into their life. Our idea of rewards is not just a simple loyalty program,
we have a strategic plan in place to create mass adoption.
2.2 Consumer Rebate Rewards Application
PRO oﬀers an exciting retail incentive to the rapidly growing number of
online shoppers.[4] When consumers shop at some of their favorite
online retailers like Walmart, Best Buy, JC Penny and even Petco just to
name a few, they will receive PRO cryptocurrency through the Rebate
Rewards Platform.
Once people understand the beneﬁts of shopping with a decentralized
cryptocurrency, they will discover why cryptocurrency is a lot more
exciting than traditional cash back. PRO’s platform is a simple way for
the masses to experience cryptocurrency without it seeming overly
complicated. In other words, PRO makes cryptocurrency simple and
fun to use.

Cryptocurrencies will no longer be limited to technology experts and
advanced speculators. Everyone who shops through the PRO Rebate
Rewards application will automatically start collecting cryptocurrency as
a rebate. This allows them to own cryptocurrency and also become a
speculator. This is how it will be possible for the general population to
easily become a part of the cryptocurrency community.
PRO will launch the PRO Rebate Rewards Platform at the same time
that distribution starts.
2.3 Business/Merchant Solutions Reward Application
How do you get a business or merchant to want your product? Usually,
you must oﬀer something that will enhance the company and help
increase loyal customers so that the business can be more proﬁtable.
How has cryptocurrency technology helped businesses adopt
cryptocurrency?
The PRO Business Solutions application will be oﬀered for free. This will
help guide businesses into understanding how they can beneﬁt from
accepting cryptocurrency. Businesses will discover the importance and
advantages of cryptocurrency through our application. The Business
Solutions app has 4 components within the app that will add
tremendous value to any business.(a)
The application is designed to help businesses further learn about
business development, branding, advertising and the advantages of
cryptocurrency.

The application is designed to help businesses further learn about
business development, branding, advertising and the advantages of
cryptocurrency.
One of the components of this application is an intuitive learning
platform with educational modules that are simple for businesses to
learn about cryptocurrency. PRO will reward businesses as they
complete the courses on the app with special advertising credits and in
some cases, even bonus coins. This is a great way by which they can
experience how consumers earn rebate coins. This will incentivize
businesses to start accepting and using cryptocurrency. This beneﬁts
businesses and their customers mutually.
Once customers and business owners have PRO rewards, they will
naturally want to know how they can sell, trade, and use these coins.

3. Applications Designed for Mass Use
Bitcoin is one of the only coins that some merchants are willing to
accept as a form of payment. PRO’s purpose is commerce, allowing
consumers and businesses to do transactions in a simple, eﬃcient and
secure way.
At PRO, we believe in the power of relationships and having the right
connections inside of the e-commerce industry. PRO is creating solid
relationships with businesses by oﬀering tremendous value through
educating them on the power of utilizing and accepting PRO as a form
of payment. As a result, businesses will also receive advertising credits
and coin rewards as they educate themselves about PRO currency.
3.1 Phase 2 - Create Loyal Businesses and Consumers who use PRO
Many cryptocurrency speculators and users are extremely loyal and
passionate about cryptocurrency and the community as a whole.
Businesses that accept cryptocurrency as payment and become
passionate about cryptocurrency will attract those in the
cryptocurrency community. Consumers need to have a simple way to
convert ﬁat currency into cryptocurrency and vice versa.
3.2 Merchant Payment Application
PRO is aiming to become one of the ﬁrst retail-friendly and easy to use
cryptocurrency applications where merchants can receive payments
from their consumers who own cryptocurrency, within a simple,
eﬃcient, and secure platform. There will be a dashboard including
analytics and CRM tools. This will track business transactions in PRO
and BTC. This application can be the start of daily usage of
cryptocurrencies.

Businesses will discover how to further expand their business and
customer reach as they implement cryptocurrency into their business.
Most businesses desire more exposure for their brand. When a
company becomes open to accepting cryptocurrency as a form of
payment, they open themselves up to a loyal community of crypto
enthusiasts excited to see a business supporting the cause. This
application will also give crypto users a way to spend their coins.
Businesses that use the free Merchant app will receive PRO rewards
based on how many PRO they've accepted for the month. PRO rewards
are limited to the ﬁrst 30 days of opening up a business account. In the
future, the more PRO they accept, the more free advertising credits
they will receive to be able to market to consumers using PRO's
platform.
3.3 Social Exchange Application
Consumers will easily be able to convert their ﬁat currency into PRO
and Bitcoin and vice versa. This will make it convenient for the masses
to use cryptocurrency in their everyday life.
This app will also be used as a cryptocurrency shopping platform
displaying which businesses are accepting PRO. Consumers will also
learn all of the beneﬁts of PRO. They will also have the ability to see the
percentages of the coin back reward that each store will oﬀer as well as
how much savings they will be able to receive from each speciﬁc store.
This social sharing platform will be integrated into all of the social
sharing sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.

4. Details on PRO’s Four Applications
PRO will launch 4 applications that have a distinct purpose for both
consumers and business owners. The ﬁrst launch will be the Rebate
Rewards Application at the end of the ICO during the same time
distribution starts. The Business Solutions Application will be the
second app that will start development in the 2nd Quarter of 2017. The
Merchant Payment Application is scheduled to start development in
the 4th Quarter of 2017. The Social Exchange Application is scheduled
to start development in the 1st Quarter of 2018. Cryptocurrencies
need direct exposure to the masses, especially in a retail environment.
PRO's applications will bring mass awareness, engagement, and
distribution for cryptocurrencies.
4.1 Details on the Rebate Rewards App
The Rebate Rewards app has over 4000 major online retailers for
customers to shop at and receive PRO rebates on all of their purchases
made through the application. In order for a customer to receive
rewards they will need to create an account. When they shop online it
will be linked to their account where everything can be tracked.
Accounts can be accessed through almost any device. The consumer
can shop through their mobile device or tablet by downloading the iOS
app or Android app. They can download the extension to Google
Chrome if they prefer to shop through a computer as well.
When PRO launches this application, it will ﬁrst launch in the USA only
because most of the major retailers listed on the app are located inside
of the USA. As expansion continues, other retailers outside the USA will
be allowed to register as a trusted retail partner & also oﬀer rebates for
their products.
We are looking for companies that will oﬀer great products to the
public. This will create strategic alliances that will enhance awareness
and usability for PRO owners and users.

4.1.1 Setting up your Rebate Rewards Application and Account
A customer can simply register and create an account online or
through the app for free. Once their account is created, they can open
the browser they use most on their computer and download the
extension into their browser to track all of their purchases and
calculate all of their coin back rebates. After they complete the simple
setup process, their account can be connected to any device they
choose to shop on. This will allow customers to access their coin
rewards and continue to use the shopping app on many devices.
The consumer can search for products based on brand name or based
on categories.
If the consumer is browsing on their computer and the extension is
active, an automatic notiﬁcation will appear if they land on one of the
4000 plus major retailer sites that oﬀer PRO Rebate Rewards. As an
example some sites oﬀer up to 2.1% rebate, while others may oﬀer up
to 35% or more in rebate rewards. This is a great feature because you
will automatically know if a retailer is one of the 4000 plus stores that
oﬀer PRO Rebate Rewards without having to manually look it up on the
list.
4.1.2 How and When the Customers Receive their Rebate Reward
The PRO Rebate Rewards will be sent to their PRO address provided
when transactions are complete and the retailer conﬁrms veriﬁcation.
The rebate is released after the return policy period for that speciﬁc
retailer has passed. Most major retailers will release the rebate after 60
to 90 days to make sure products that were bought were not returned.
This 60-90 day period is based solely on the speciﬁc retailer's return
policy.

4. (cont.)
All purchases that a customer completes through the app are
timestamped. This is when the coin rebate earned by the customer will
be posted to the customer’s dashboard as a pending reward. Within
24 hours the pending status will appear in consumer's account
showing how many coins based on USD value is pending in their
account. When the coins move from pending status to the consumer's
account, they will receive the amount of coins based on when they
purchased the product, even if it’s months later. Price of PRO will be
ﬁxed at the time of product purchase.
This application is a ﬁrst of it’s kind. We have a strategy to help a
consumer who might not know anything about cryptocurrency start the
journey on wanting to learn more about cryptocurrency. Now that the
consumer received PRO for doing what they already do, which is
shopping at their favorite major retailer, they will want to know what
they can do with these coins. The consumer has options to shop at
retailers who accept the coin or they might want to trade the coin and
become a speculator. That is one of the strategies to get
cryptocurrency to the masses in a simple way with just one of our apps.
4.2 Details on the Solutions App
The PRO Business Solutions Application will help guide businesses into
the new emerging world of commerce. The application has four
components within the app that will add tremendous value to any
business.
The application is free to all businesses. The learning center within the
application will be fun and informative for business owners and
authorized staﬀ.

where the user going through it can level up during the learning
process. Businesses will watch videos and read content on diﬀerent
subjects regarding cryptocurrency, blockchain, payments, business
development, brand awareness techniques, advertising strategies and
more.
4.2.1 Business Development, Brand Awareness, and Advertising
Strategies
Advertising and marketing is the lifeblood of most businesses. [5]
PRO will implement proven strategies to help companies increase
exposure, get more leads, and achieve more sales. The more value and
help these businesses receive while using PRO’s business solutions
app, the more likely they are to become loyal to the cryptocurrency
community.
Business development systems will be put in place to prepare
companies to accept cryptocurrency and further expand their company
by taking advantage of the economic shift happening in commerce
through cryptocurrency.
4.2.2 The Intuitive Learning Gamiﬁcation Center
Businesses will have access to this application for free. The application
will have simple training modules that are intuitive and fun for users to

4.2.3 The Business Gets Rewarded for Learning
PRO will reward businesses when completing the courses on the app.
This is a great way to incentivize businesses to start accepting and
using cryptocurrency. As business owners educate themselves through
the diﬀerent levels inside of the intuitive learning application, they will
build up coin rewards for the ﬁrst course they complete. Since the
reward will be paid in PRO, this will empower the business to embrace
the power of cryptocurrency and make use of the value they have
obtained.
As they continue to complete multiple courses they will receive PRO or
advertising credits that will go towards gaining more exposure and
advertising. The more exposure they have on the platform, the more
they will be exposed to consumers that will want to buy their products
and services. Only veriﬁed businesses or approved admins will be able
to take advantage of these features of earning rewards for the
company. PRO rewards will only be paid out to registered businesses
for completing each course. Submissions will be veriﬁed as they need
to be cross-checked for legitimacy. This will be checked with
international business registrations as well as national businesses
registrations. This is to prevent false registrations or fake businesses
from taking advantage of this incentive.
There will be a ranking system based on how accurate and how fast the
business owner levels up through the diﬀerent courses. The higher
they score the more recognition and rewards they get, and the more
free advertising credits they will build up.
As businesses complete the education course and understand how to
use, trade, and accept cryptocurrency, they will also have the
opportunity to download the Merchant Payment Application once
available. Businesses that have already shown experience in using
and/or understanding cryptocurrency can move through this process
very quickly.

4.3 Pitfalls of Traditional Merchant Services
Businesses face many challenges with traditional merchant services
that cryptocurrency has been able to overcome. When a business
switches over to cryptocurrency they will experience the many beneﬁts
of blockchain technology. Some of the challenges experienced by
businesses are:
•Online credit card fraud and customers causing chargebacks
•If a business has a high ratio of chargebacks and exceeds their allotment based on the
standards, that account gets shut down
•If that business has a large amount of unforeseen volume depicting an abnormal
growth rate, that account is at risk of getting terminated
•Businesses often experience hold backs
•Sometimes based on the type of activity that account shows, the bank will require the
business to maintain large cash reserves
•The application and approval process is very tedious, especially if you are a new
company
•Some companies must wait months for reconciling and receiving deposits
•Higher interchange fees for new startup businesses

These are just some of the disadvantages of using traditional merchant
services, this is where PRO Merchant plays an important role. Once
businesses learn the advantages of cryptocurrency, they will see why
this option is the most viable solution for them to process payments.
PRO's goal is to help give control and power of ﬁnances back to
business owners.
We will oﬀer a subtle approach to bring awareness of the their need for
the merchant application by attracting them with incentives.

4.3.1 Accepting Payment in PRO
Companies that accept PRO as a form of payment will create greater
brand awareness inside of the cryptocurrency community by default.
They will discover how to further expand their company by
implementing the knowledge and experience they've learned through
the acceptance of cryptocurrency.
The Merchant Application will give businesses the ability to receive
cryptocurrency like PRO and Bitcoin as a form of payment. Consumers
will have the ability to rate a business based on how much incentive
they give, how much of a discount they award for using this app, and
purchasing products/services with cryptocurrency.
The more incentives and discounts businesses give, the higher their
rating will be in the application and in the cryptocurrency community.
The more often businesses accept PRO as a form of payment, the
greater their rank and rating will be as well. This will earn them
advertising credits through the application, and give them the ability to
gain more advertising exposure.
4.4 Details on the Social Exchange App
The Exchange application is where users will be able to convert PRO
and Bitcoin into ﬁat currency and vice versa. It will be the most
diversiﬁed and inclusive exchange application on the market. This
application makes currency exchange quick, seamless, and eﬀortless. It
will enhance the ability to interchange PRO, BTC, and USD. We will
continue to add more markets and ﬁat currencies with further
development and expansion.

Any consumer or business that is using PRO can share their experience
through social media. As they share on social media, they will get
rewarded with PRO Points/Ad Credits that will go towards prizes. We
will also hold competitions and contests that they can enter into to be
able to win PRO Points. One example is who will be the “promoter of
the month.” We will have many diﬀerent ways for consumers and
businesses to earn PRO Points/Ad Credits in a fun way by sharing.
Businesses that use and accept PRO the most, will be advertised to the
consumers according to rating. We will have data collection on the
consumers’ likes and needs based on their interests, so that
businesses can utilize targeted ads to be able to reach their desired
audiences. The more a business participates the higher their rating will
be, this rating will determine which companies will be exposed the
most to the consumers.
The rating system will show consumers which businesses accept PRO
and who is the most trusted in the community. This will be based on
transparent and honest reviews from actual customers who have made
veriﬁed purchases at these places of business. This application will be
mutually beneﬁcial to the merchant and consumer.
Availability: iOS/Andriod.
Web based integration for added security.
All the social actions will be recorded and tracked by the application.
Upon approval of social actions, accounts will be credited once
submissions are reviewed and veriﬁed.
Rewards will be given out based on participant’s interactions and social
shares. Guidelines and requirements for acceptance will be published
when app is in development.

4.5 PRO is Social
How can a currency be social? PRO has devised a method for creating
and more importantly, maintaining, social engagement. PRO will be
encouraging and rewarding the daily use of our applications. PRO’s
network will not be a traditional social network that centers around
posting or sharing on the application. We have opted to rely on other
social applications and networks for that aspect. PRO will give users the
ability to make connections with other users and increase their network
and reputation, as well as be rewarded for milestones reached along
the way in a fun and proﬁtable way.
This social interaction and reward system will have implications for
both consumers
and businesses
CONSUMERS
Since mass adoption is our primary focus, the integration of social
rewards for users is very important to implement. The following points
outline a basic framework for our rewards system but in no way detail
every aspect as we will continue to develop these concepts and
structures throughout project with help from the community of users.
4.5.1 PRO-Points
We are proud to announce our use of an alternative reward system
connected to the PRO application network. Starting with the second
phase of applications, users will begin to accumulate PRO Points. These
are not points that inherently hold a physical value or even operate
under the rules of the blockchain, but instead act the same as reward
points do in mobile gaming. The accumulation of these PRO Points for
diﬀerent actions or interactions will create positive reinforcement and
stimulate the mind of the user, giving them more reason to come back
to the application. This creates goals for the user to reach and adds to
their total personal point accumulation.

whitepaper

PRO

THE FUTURE OF COMMERCE

18 /32

procommerce.io

4. (cont.)
Studies show the rewards in mobile gaming trigger addictive reward
pathways. We plan to mirror these eﬀects to keep daily engagement
high.[6]
These PRO Points will accumulate up until the release of the Exchange
application where they will then become useable and attribute to
individual user rankings.
4.5.2 Network Ranking System
As users collect points they will add to the user’s “level” or “notoriety” on
the PRO platform, this rating can never go down even as users redeem
their PRO Points for rewards. This ranking system is a popular tactic
used on multiple current social and gaming platforms such as Imgur
and Steam. A user’s rank and badges collected will be the only thing
visible to their friends or network connections on the application.
User’s will never see another user’s balance, or purchase history unless
they choose to explicitly share those details with the public or friends.
4.5.3 Badges
Along with network rankings users will also gain badges of varying levels
for individual actions they perform on the network, for gifting coins a
user may attain a badge title of “Giver”. As they share more, this badge
will increase with their actions until they reach the badge level of
“Philanthropist.” Multiple divisions of badges will be devised and
distributed to users based on predetermined criteria.
4.5.4 Social Integration
Users will have the ability to connect their PRO account to other social
networks via our application interface. Using API and SDK methods,
users will be given the opportunity to post to Twitter, Facebook,
Pinterest, Google+ and more through the PRO apps.

THE FUTURE OF COMMERCE

4. (cont.)
We understand that these are steps that users normally do not enjoy
taking. This is why we are dedicating resources to rewarding these
steps of social sharing of activities taken on the application. A user may
be given the opportunity to share their experience with a business that
has veriﬁed a purchase using PRO, or share the PRO app itself and get
an actual reward for doing so. Much in the way that applications and
mobile games reward users for these same actions. The major
diﬀerence is the PRO Points gained through these actions can actually
be used towards future discounts, entries into lotteries, or more as
developments with the PRO Points system grows and takes on more
developers and digital content providers.
4.5.5 PRO-Point Redemption
As mentioned, users will have the ability to redeem their PRO Points for
diﬀerent rewards, promotions, contest entries, and more as the project
scope increases. The redemption of points will not subtract from a
user’s notoriety which the points have added to, they will only subtract
from the current balance of points they hold within the system.
Redemption of points will always require two-step veriﬁcation to
prevent the accidental use of PRO Points when it is unintended.
4.6 Credits for Businesses
We understand that businesses cannot be left out of the reward
structures. In our concept development sessions, we decided to
provide an alternate system to reward businesses and business
owners. This is the only way to ensure that both the consumer and
business will feel a mutual drive to continue using, accepting, and
engaging with PRO.

4.6.1 Ad Credits
Businesses and merchants on the PRO network will receive ad credits
similar to how an individual user receives PRO Points. The
accumulation will happen based on diﬀerent triggers and the
redemption will be completely diﬀerent. A business’ ad credits will
accumulate in a single account for each business regardless of how
many outlets on the PRO system this business may oﬀer.
This will likewise be a determining factor in a business’ notoriety on the
network. Ad credits will be distributed for selling products and services,
oﬀering discounts, running raﬄes, doing giveaways and performing
other actions on the network.
4.6.2 Business Rating System
Similar to the Seller Rating system used on Ebay, PRO will have a
system that rates businesses and their interactions with consumers on
the app which will be displayed on their business proﬁle. A part of the
rating scale will be inﬂuenced by the amount of ad credits the business
has accumulated through the network. The rest will be determined by
user reviews.
Businesses will also be given the opportunity to exchange Ad Credits
for Pro Points to be used as rewards for their customers who take
certain actions. Businesses can leverage these rewards to acquire new
customers and create better retention. (4.6.6)

4.6.3 Ad Credit Redemption
As businesses accumulate their Ad Credits, they will have the
opportunity to use those credits to be able to run non-invasive
advertisements on the PRO applications. Ad Credits contribute towards
their network rating. These ads will be powered by encrypted and
hashed metadata on PRO consumer buyer history with the intent to
ensure that users do not get advertisements for products which do not
match their real-life interests.
The ads will be available in multiple formats and delivery methods, from
interstitial to banner ads. However, all ads will have a strict no-spam
policy and an even more strict no direct targeting policy to maintain our
commitment to user conﬁdentiality of race, color and creed. Only user
purchase data will be accessible targeting options for marketers,
making the platform advertisements entirely product and service
driven.
4.6.4 Ad Credit Redemption
PRO has plans to integrate a full product search engine on the
Exchange Application. This will enable users to ﬁnd products and
services which they can purchase using PRO. Once this integration has
been made, businesses will also have the ability to redeem ad credits to
bid for higher spots in these search results. This will bring their product
to the top of the list during active users searches, which display the
user's direct purchase intent.

4.6.5 Ads Disclaimer
We understand advertisements are not looked upon favorably by most
users on applications. That is why our intent and commitment is to
maintain a strict and regulated ad market where businesses must
adhere to a series of user-friendly rules. Our aim is to show the user
that the advertisements can become a great aid to them without being
a burden or taking up too much screen space.
4.6.6 Ad Credits Convert into PRO Points through Exchange App
Businesses can convert Ad Credits to PRO Points for the purpose of
rewarding their customers who take certain actions e.g. leave a review
positive or negative, buy during a sale, purchase a certain item, share
their experience with the business on social media. Businesses can use
these rewards to acquire more customers and create better retention.
Consumers will also have the opportunity to convert PRO Points into Ad
Credits if they own a business and would like to advertise on the
platform. The conversion rate is 1 PRO Point to 1 Ad Credit.

5. Unsold Coins and their Purpose
Unsold coins will be kept in a 3-4 multi-sig. Two of our team members
will have one key each and two separate reputable escrows will have
the other 2 keys for a total of 4 keys.This will prevent anyone from
having access to these coins unless all terms are met.
Each app will have their own reserved amount of coins, and these coins
will have a speciﬁc purpose within each app.

30% will be escrowed for PRO Solutions
25% will be escrowed for PRO Merchant
20% will be escrowed for PRO Exchange
All coins will be in cold storage and will be incapable of staking.
These coins will be kept locked until the development of such
application is ﬁnalized and launched.This will help prevent the market
from being ﬂooded. This will also prevent people from dumping a large
amounts of coins. The coins will be released slowly over the course of
the next 7-15 years and will be used to incentivize consumers and
businesses to get involved in the use of cryptocurrency. By giving out
small amounts of coins for each app, this will keep a small amount of
coins being released as incentive from the apps and maintain a fair
distribution process.
The Address of these coins will be made public in the escrow
agreement. When the allocated coins run out, the promotional period
will end. By that time, objectives and goals of reaching mainstream
commerce will be accomplished. It is systematically combined to
release coins based on the amount of users. The market will never
ﬂood. Coins will be released into circulation as more users are coming
in. This will create a favorable supply vs. demand ratio. If there are no
users no coins will be released.

5. (cont.)
To be even more transparent and open, we will always disclose the
status of all the unsold coins, what they are used for and how they are
being utilized for rewards. This can be done directly or indirectly
through supported or main contributors.
5.1 PRO Solutions will have incentives for businesses to learn and
utilize the power of cryptocurrency in their favor. After completion of all
courses, a one time incentive of PRO will be given out to businesses to
go out and use the coins for the growth of their business.
5.2 PRO Merchant will be used as a tool for businesses to accept and
record payments in PRO & BTC. With powerful analytics and CRM tools,
this app will be a business’ best method of receiving payments. It will
also have the ability to give you a deep insight into how your business is
progressing by day, week, month, and yearly timeframes. First time
users of this app will receive a one-time bonus of PRO Rewards as an
incentive. This will give businesses a reason to accept, utilize, and store
PRO. Only registered businesses will be able to have full access to this
app. The more a business uses this app and oﬀers incentives, the more
Ad Credits they will receive.
5.3 PRO Exchange will be another very powerful tool, it will have the
capability of exchanging PRO/BTC into ﬁat and vice versa. This process
will happen within the app. For ﬁrst time users, there will also be an
incentive paid in PRO Rewards. This is used to promote the usability of
PRO and create a volume within the PRO ecosystem. Consumers and
businesses will get rewarded for sharing their experience on social
media. Consumers will receive PRO Points, businesses will receive Ad
Credits.
Both consumers and businesses will be able to use this application.

6. Ease of Use
PRO will be pre-mined into existence, and there will be a total of 15
billion coins pre-mined. We ﬁnd that for the masses, having a larger
amount of coins makes it easier to calculate instead of dividing coins
into minor parts like mbtc or even satoshis. This method is more
convenient to use as an alternative to ﬁat currency. We like this
approach because it makes more sense to buy goods and services for
20 PRO instead of 0.015413 BTC for example. Considering the global
market cap for commerce and not just cryptocurrency markets, we
established that the amount of coins pre-mined was a perfect ﬁt for
this platform to reach its goals. Another very important factor is that we
are not aiming to disrupt one industry, we are aiming to disrupt
commerce itself. The commerce industry alone produces Trillions of
dollars in volume annually, so it is imperative and required to have 15+
billion coins to supplement this. [7]
Even a 1% dent in this industry will add billions of dollars to the
cryptocurrency market cap.
The applications are designed to incentivize the users. Some of the
coins will be issued as a reward to individuals and businesses across
the globe. This is another reason why it is required for us to have a
larger amount of coins. This will bring people in from around the world
that have never participated in cryptocurrency or even heard about it.
Since there will be a vast amount of users, these coins will be given out
in small quantities to each individual as an incentive. The user has to
actually make purchases from the retailers to earn this reward. This will
prevent monopolization by distributing the coins evenly, based on
purchased amount.
We believe this is how we can accomplish mass adoption, replicating
what is already known to work and applying it to cryptocurrency in a
innovative way.

7. Coin Specifications
Algorithm: SHA256 + POS
Coin Name: PRO
Coin Ticker: XRO
Max Supply: 75 Billion
Pre-mine: 15 Billion
POS Reward:
150 Coins/ Block 1st Year
100 Coins/ Block 2nd Year
50 Coins/ Block until max supply is reached
Block Time: 60 Seconds
Min Age: 6 Hours
The higher block rewards of the ﬁrst two years are speciﬁcally targeted
for PRO’s aggressive mass adoption phases, to encourage
individuals/businesses to compete for this reward. Thus creating
volume and price stability. After two years, it will remain a solid 50 coins
per block indeﬁnitely.
We also chose a POS coin to further incentivize the holders of this coin
as a reward to maintain the stability of the network. This will be directly
coordinated with the participants of our ICO, since the only coins that
will be in circulation in the beginning stages will be the ones distributed
during the ICO, along with those given out with the Coin Back Rebate
Rewards app. This will give ICO participants the upperhand in the
staking process.

PRO

THE FUTURE OF COMMERCE

7. (cont.)
We also want to promote an environmentally friendly POS coin to the
masses. Businesses and individuals will have PRO in their hands from
one or more of our four apps. They will be intrigued when they ﬁnd out
that they can put those coins to work and potentially earn a block
reward. This will encourage them to want to purchase more coins to
compete in the staking process, which will add even more volume and
price stimulation. A POS block reward system will appeal to businesses
and individuals more than a complicated process of traditional mining.
This will in turn help the infrastructure of PRO and solidify a strong and
robust network. We feel this is the best option to reach the masses
along with a simple and easy to use coin.
7.1 Wallets
In order to appeal more to the masses, PRO has to be accessible to
everyone in a smooth and easy to use method. We will lay out an array
of clients and wallets where it will make the access of coins intuitive
and eﬀective. This is geared more towards the average consumer and
business because the crypto community is knowledgeable and already
understands how to use these clients. Pro will create the following
clients;
QT Wallet - Windows, Mac, Linux
Prolectrum Wallet - Windows, Mac
Paper Wallets
Modern Wallet - Windows, Mac
iOS/Android Lite Clients
Chrome extension
Web Wallets
This will attract the average person to access PRO from any mobile
device, tablet or computer. They will have a seamless option on how
they can spend their PRO. By giving them these options, it will make the
process of buying and paying one another easy and eﬃcient.

ABOUT THE PROJECT
âIt will be everywhere and the world will have to readjust.â
- John McAfee about Bitcoin

The blockchain industry is only at its inception and the growth potential matches the internet
expansion in the late nineties. Just as search engines, browsers and social networks disrupted the
Internet; Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain-associated ecosystems will force traditional
institutions to reconsider and change their roles in the industry. Every day new projects are being
introduced, established institutions are entering the blockchain, and a growing number of users is
adopting the blockchain disruptive technology. Great projects like Iconomi and Taas have already
successfully connected users to the landscape of several cryptocurrencies and crypto assets. Our part
is to connect thousands of gateways with millions of transactions that are currently executed within
the isolated exchanges.

Figure 1. Crypto exchanges diversity plot is exposing trading pairs associated with a given exchange.

At the time of writing, there are 756 different cryptocurrencies and 128 different digital assets that
trade between 4179 exchanges and gateways worldwide. The volume of daily crypto transactions
represents an unprecedented opportunity to exploit the price differences between multiple
exchanges. Arbitrage Digital Asset Pool will cover the largest number of gateways and seek to profit
on every transaction that is processed by proprietary algorithms. Such market maker is well positioned
to own a single entry point to any cryptocurrency or digital asset worldwide.
We are dedicated to the mission of establishing RIALTO.AI as the largest arbitrage and market maker
in the growing multi-billion landscape of cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and blockchain transactions.
By providing liquidity and matching orders, we are increasing the efficiency of crypto markets, while
earning a fraction on every transaction for our supporters.

The purpose of this document is for every supporter to gain a clear insight into our business model,
the team behind it and our long term vision. Our core algorithms for automated arbitrage will be
described and proposed improvements using machine learning approach will be exposed.

BUSINESS FOUNDATION
âIn the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield.â
- Warren Buffett

Business foundation of RIALTO.AI is built on four pillars for successful implementation and feasibility
of arbitrage and market making strategies in the cryptocurrency markets.
1. Scaling up of private arbitrage scripts, their running stability, and executing efficiency.
2. Utilizing economies of scale through successful crowdsale (lowering the âspill-overâ costs of the
need for having pools of assets allocated at different exchanges and gateways).
3. Increasing transactional efficiency by lowering volume based fees and negotiating individual
agreements.
4. Multiplying the number of end trade events by covering additional exchanges and gateways.
We are closely monitoring development of new markets and gateways within the blockchain
transactional landscape. The industry exhibits strong double-digit growth rates and we expect this
trend to continue in the near future. In order to have the advantage of positioning as the first mover,
we evaluate different expanding options on the ongoing basis. Any new market entrances will be
announced through press releases.

MARKET INSIGHT
âI never guess. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.â
- Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

We perform regular market analysis to keep an eye on the big picture. It is of extreme importance to
recognize general market trends to maximize the potential of our developed arbitrage algorithms.
Volume, volatility and technological feasibility of API implementations are major determining factors.
Therefore, it is at the sole discretion of the team to decide which markets and exchanges will be
covered. The decision will always be made in accordance with the value maximization guidelines.
Data depicted below represents the most relevant information about the current state of crypto
markets. The market is a dynamical growing system and as such is a subject of constant change. The
chart below demonstrates BTC dominance in the market that reaches 39% at the time of writing.

Figure 2. Cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

More important metric for arbitrage is 24h trading volume of a certain currency. We can see in the
figure below that BTC is again dominating with 1.6 billion USD of trading volume in one day. ETH daily
trading volume is exhibiting higher growth and can surpass BTC in case this trend continues. All the
currencies listed below have trading volumes large enough for automatic trading execution.

8

RIALTO.AI | Crypto AI arbitrage and market maker | Whitepaper 1.1

Figure 3. Cryptocurrencies listed by 24h trading volume.

Arbitrage can be executed among different trading pairs. Pairs that exceed 10 million USD in terms of
24h trading volume are listed below. Trading pairs below provide enough liquidity for simultaneous
selling and buying procedures executed by our trading algorithms.

Figure 4. Cryptocurrency trading pairs with daily volume above 10 million USD.

Tokens deriving from numerous crowdsale projects represent another potential opportunity for
arbitrage trading. Besides cryptocurrencies, such tokens are also listed on major exchanges and
represent more diverse trading environment that can be exploited. In the first three months, RIALTO.AI
will not execute any trades on listed tokens from recent successful crowdsales as the majority of tokens
are listed for less than 12 months and sufficient market data for reliable evaluation does not yet exist.
We see it as the first potential for expanding our strategy when the market trading parameters for
tokens will match the ones of largest cryptocurrencies.

RIALTO.AI | Crypto AI arbitrage and market maker | Whitepaper 1.1

Figure 5. Major assets that are listed on crypto exchanges.

Spread Analysis
Arbitrage and market making feasibility is dependent on the spread between prices for individual asset.
In the growing and especially young markets, spreads and complementary inefficiencies tend to be
higher. This is because demand and supply vary according to the characteristics of particular local
markets, features of individual exchange, reputation of particular exchange, limitation of capital flows
between countries, etc. Cryptocurrency markets exhibit the same evolvement pattern and the price
difference can be exploited for a profit while satisfying the need of the market for efficient order
matchmaking and liquidity.

Figure 6. Price volatility is a statistical measure of a price fluctuation. Higher volatility tends to result
in more trading opportunities.

10

RIALTO.AI | Crypto AI arbitrage and market maker | Whitepaper 1.1

Volatility is an important influencing factor that is highly correlated with the arbitrage spread margins.
In the times of higher market volatility prices between exchanges tend to vary disproportionately. This
increase in margins occurs due to different trading volumes on exchanges, efficiency of the underlying
execution systems, and market psychology (e.g. panic selling). As the market settles and observed asset
is trading within the narrow channel, the spread margins converge closer.

Figure 7. Increase of spread margins (Bitstamp-Kraken) in times of increased market volatility during the 48-hour period.

Number of price divergence events is growing in the cryptocurrency markets. We expect this trend to
steadily continue in the near future as new exchanges and gateways are entering the market. The
spread margins however are projected to stay the same. If in the medium term, the regulation
environment for blockchain and crypto markets improves this would result in establishment of the few
institutional and licensed coin exchanges. Therefore the price spreads between the designated
exchanges would converge to lower percentage but also enable arbitrage on a larger average volume
per trade.

Figure 8. BTC price comparison in a 3 hour trading window. The visible price difference for different exchanges is
exploited by the arbitrage algorithm that executes trades at two exchanges simultaneously.

11

RIALTO.AI | Crypto AI arbitrage and market maker | Whitepaper 1.1

Key part of the arbitrage algorithm is the selective filtering through the database of available arbitrage
events. Arbitrage event is defined as the occurrence of optimal volume match and sufficient price
difference between identical assets that enables minimum net margin after transaction fees on both
gateways are met.
Table of arbitrage events is included in Appendix 1.
Trade event is labelled every arbitrage event that complies with preconditioned order book depth
parameter, and execution slippage indicator.
Table of trade events is included in Appendix 2.

Figure 9. Number of total price divergence events for major exchanges.

Our target amount and hard cap of 10 million USD in nominal value is calculated on the optimal
performance we could achieve at the current market volume. In case the market will
disproportionately outgrow our projections, we would evaluate potential for expanding to institutional
investments, which would further benefit our crowdsale supporters.
Calculation is based on the average available arbitrage volume in most recent period on selected
exchanges. The change in price of cryptocurrencies used in trading (e.g. BTC and ETH) varies and
therefore directly influences the need and optimal amount for liquidity pools and floating capital.

12

RIALTO.AI | Crypto AI arbitrage and market maker | Whitepaper 1.1

EXAMPLE OF TRADING LIQUIDITY CYCLE ON BTC:

LIQUIDITY POOL

FLOATING CAPITAL

Floating capital consists of cryptocurrencies and fiat assets in circulations which are movable and
storable. This capital is crucial and enables ongoing utilisation of arbitrage algorithm. Absence of
sufficient floating capital is weighing on performance of small-scale arbitrage and market making
funds.
We monitor the amount of liquidity pools on every exchange and use a predictive model to estimate
when the relocation of floating capital will be necessary. Performing such strategy allows us enough
time to relocate assets and optimize running performance.

STRATEGY
âThe most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.â
- Albert Einstein

The competitive advantage of RIALTO.AI is carved into the proprietary nature of algorithms and
software tools. They help identify trade opportunities, interpret the historical database, find data
patterns, and adjust the parameters in real-time. The in-house research and development of
algorithms and trading tools is the main driver behind the success of the fund and will represent the
winning edge and growth driver in the future.

1. Arbitrage
The developed arbitrage algorithm
executes simultaneous purchase and sale
of a cryptocurrency pair to profit from a
difference in the price between different
exchanges. The algorithm uses 24/7 live
data stream of order books from several
exchanges that fulfil the background check
criteria. The trading algorithm only
executes arbitrage trades when all of the
predefined criteria are checked. The
control parameters are adjusted in realtime. One simple criterion is sufficient
divergence (Fig. 7), i.e., the minimum
difference in prices between two
exchanges that still enables a profitable
trade after netting the execution fees.
Another criterion is the depth and the
deviation of the market order book, which
insures that the trade is executed
simultaneously or it does not enter the
trade at all.
In the second development phase, when
the representative sample will be big
enough for implementation (>30.000
executions), we intend to use machine
learning techniques to train the classifier
which will automate the decision making
process for executing trades. In particular,
we will use expert knowledge to extract
features, which describe data in the best
possible manner. Each criterion will be

Figure 10. Arbitrage flow chart.

14

RIALTO.AI | Crypto AI arbitrage and market maker | Whitepaper 1.1

represented by a set of features. In the last
step, we intend to use historical data to
train the classifier and fine-tune the
classification parameters.

2. Market Making
With the market making on less liquid
markets, we provide liquidity, reduce
average transaction time and earn a
fraction of the cost of a traded currency.
The market making algorithm is a
modification of an arbitrage strategy and
includes pushing orders out in contrast to
only accepting the existing orders. The
greatest potential to be exploited is in
creating the market between gateways
within the Ripple payment protocol. With
the growing number of new gateways,
there is an increasing demand for a
designated market maker. We are well
positioned to benefit from any upside
trend in volume and number of
transactions.
We intend to improve automated decision
making process with the adoption of
machine learning. The decision on
exchanges that should be used for the bids
and asks will be made by a classifier trained
specifically for this purpose. The classifier
will take into account the bid and asking
prices for each exchange for the particular
cryptocurrency, the depth of the order
books, and changes of the volatility ratios.
The classifier will be trained and tested
using the historical data, and validated on
the actual real-time data. The algorithm
parameters will be adjusted to satisfy the
predefined performance metrics (such as
the net return, slippage ratio, execution
time and others).

3. AI Tradebot
(In development)
In finance, if you could monitor all
Goldman Sachsâ transactional accounts,
you would have the competitive
advantage of positioning yourself before
the big market movements. In most
cryptocurrencies,
addresses
and
transactions are part of a publicly
distributed ledger. While it is impossible to
follow the accounts and movements
manually, we are developing a proprietary
self-learning algorithm that will be able to
track & pool addresses into matching
patterns. In the second step, the algorithm
compares transaction flows against the
historical data and forms the output of
predefined pattern recognition. Focus is on
the implementation potential at the three
initial levels:
1. Monitoring of crowdsale
raised funds within the lock
up periods (tracking
crowdsale addresses).

Figure 11. AI tradebot flow chart.

2. Recognition pattern for market
manipulation schemes such as
pump and dump (anomaly in the
number of participating
transactions from repetitive or
connected addresses).

3. Unusual movements
(outliers) in the known major
institutional addresses.
(Satoshi, Kraken etc.)

Forecasting Price Movements
We use time series approach to monitor and evaluate general trends in selected cryptocurrencies. This
helps us identify potential volatility and positioning opportunities on chosen cryptocurrency in the
future.
The value of a cryptocurrency changes with time and, therefore, it can be considered a time series.
Artificial intelligence, and especially machine learning methods, are proven to be of essential asset of
finding repeating patterns, predicting the future course, and the trend of the time series. Machine
learning methods usually use numerous hand-crafted features, some of them representing the expert
knowledge and some of them are extracted using statistics of the time-series itself (mean, standard
deviation, mean crossing rate). In this way, the machine learning model is able to analyze thousands
and sometimes millions of feature vectors in order to learn some patterns and better forecast the
future trends. In our approach, we will additionally include contextual information about the current
value, which is not present in the time series data itself, but it is known and available for human
experts. This contextual information includes lock up periods (for example, tracking crowdsale
addresses), movements in the known major institutional addresses (Satoshi, Kraken, etc.), approaching
16

RIALTO.AI | Crypto AI arbitrage and market maker | Whitepaper 1.1

a psychological barriers with the value, the trend of other cryptocurrencies, amount and volume of
trades, etc. With the previously described approach we will emulate the behaviour and thinking of an
experienced trading person, which takes into account additional contextual information when making
the analysis and the prediction of the cryptocurrency value.
Artificial intelligence has proven its power and advantage at recognizing general trends, in trading
traditional stocks and other time-series analysis tasks. Inspired by this, we focus on creating an artificial
intelligence tradebot that will be able to predict the course and the trend of particular cryptocurrency.
In particular, we apply two types of predictive models. The first is a classification model, which predicts
the direction of the change: whether it is going to be positive, negative or constant. The second
algorithm is a forecasting model that will use the input of the first one, and will project the price of the
cryptocurrency.

WHY SUPPORT US?
âFor profit, diversification, and increased efficiency of crypto markets.â
- RIALTO.AI Team

Arbitrage and market making strategies are not sensitive to one direction price movements, like buy
and hold strategies, and therefore enable you to profit in times of both bull (raising prices) and bear
market (falling prices).
Every cryptocurrency investor is heavily exposed to any potential market corrections, downtrends, or
bigger turmoil that could cause the instability of the prices and result in a loss of part, or all of the
investorâs crypto investments. For example, during the last week of May 2017, the total cryptocurrency
market lost more than 30% in value over the course of 48 hours.
Through investment in arbitrage and market making, you can hedge your existing investments and
secure your stream of profits in cases of market downturns or increased volatility. In fact, we embrace
volatility as in times of swinging market prices the arbitrage spreads are higher and our profitability
margins expands. Vice versa, arbitrage spreads are lower when the markets move in a narrow sideways
frame.
This is why we recommend everyone to hedge their crypto investments and invest part of their
portfolio to arbitrage and market making strategies, whether they do this manually by themselves, or
they invest in the arbitrage Digital Asset Pool.
As a market maker we hold large volumes of assets on different gateways and can fulfil a large amount
of orders in the financial markets, ensuring that blockchain users can fill crypto asset orders quickly
and efficiently. By providing additional liquidity to the markets, we are reducing the average volatility
and maintaining a fair and orderly market.
Our project is positioned to evolve into leading arbitrage fund in the field, with the team that has strong
and proven background in the industry. We have a perfect market fit combination to follow and benefit
from the growing need for connectivity of cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and blockchain transactions.

SECURITY
âA watched pot never boils.â
- Someone's grandma
RIALTO.AI will follow uncompromising guidelines of internal and external compliance in order to
influence industry practices and establish itself as the first representative institutional arbitrage and
market maker in the blockchain industry.
All assets under RIALTO.AI ownership will be distributed among different multi signature wallets.
Neither of the wallets or transactional accounts will have single point access. Access will be distributed
and rotated in accordance with internal compliance factors. Neither of the wallets or transactional
accounts will hold more than 10% of the total assets. Recover phrases and key access codes will be
secured at the designated bank without single person access. This will be further clarified in the
âGeneral terms and conditions.â
Security guidelines will include, but will not be limited to: performing internal compliance checks,
monitoring of effectiveness, eliminating one-point access to the running algorithms and stored assets,
performing a third party audit report, ensure the integrity of data sources, fulfil a background check

Risk Exposure and Mitigating Factors
The arbitrage risk exposure that RIALTO.AI has is weighed mostly on the partial amount of funds that
are stored at several exchanges in order to be well positioned for arbitrage. Those funds are potentially
vulnerable for hacker attacks, denials of service, etc. To mitigate that risk, RIALTO.AI uses a dynamically
balancing system of storing majority of funds in cold wallets and only transferring the optimal amount
of needed capital for positions. The optimal balance is constantly recalculated using dynamic
calibration, to signal the need before the spilling effect among exchanges. Furthermore, Rialto carefully
selects only reliable exchanges that pass comprehensive background check (known owner,
compliance, secure access points, audit, etc.). RIALTO.AI will on best effort basis ensure all other
possible measures to limit all the possible risks.

LONG TERM OUTLOOK
âThe people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.â
- Steve Jobs

We have a unique opportunity to fully exploit the advantages of being the first and the largest arbitrage
and market making fund in the growing industry of blockchain transactions.
A successful establishment as the largest market maker will enable us the coverage of the largest
number of exchanges and gateways in the blockchain transaction industry, which includes
cryptocurrencies, digital assets and payment protocols.
In September 2018, the pilot project of connecting several most reliable exchanges into a single point
access platform will be revealed. Goal of the project is to test the feasibility of optimal transactional
structure, fees, and connectivity of the platform. Subscribed test users will be invited to join beta
platform and transact through a directory of selected gateways.
A single point access gives you the ability to reach any cryptocurrency at any exchange in the world.
RIALTO.AI will be looking into different ways to develop into a platform, where users will be able to
buy or sell any crypto asset at the currently best price worldwide. The buyers and sellers will benefit
from consolidated supply, transparency of prices, greater pool of available market orders, and most
importantly from access simplicity. The long-term goal is to evolve into an entry single point for crypto
transactions, as Google is for the search queries.

1. Introduction
Prescription abandonment and medication non-adherence
have reached epidemic proportions costing the U.S.
healthcare system and taxpayers $300B per year and
worse yet 125,000 lives are lost every single year (1).
To distill that down a bit, if the $300B cost was evenly
shared with all of the 313MM people in the U.S., we would
each pay $958 per year. That doesn’t account for the
smaller, but more important number.
125,000 human lives are lost. This needs to change.
Since starting to track medication adherence and
prescription abandonment the National Association of
Chain Drug Stores (NACDS) has found (2), “that 20–30
percent of medication prescriptions are never filled and
approximately 50 percent of medications for chronic
disease are not taken as prescribed.”
Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy benefit
management (PBM) company in the U.S., estimated that
in 2013, medication non-adherence cost the U.S.
healthcare system and taxpayers $313 billion dollars (3).
Another study conducted around the same time by “The
New England Journal of Medicine” estimates that the
number is between $100 billion and $289 billion annually
(4).

Why is the range of estimated cost estimates of
medication non-adherence so wide? Data.
Medical and prescription data are fragmented among
different provider and payer entities and there are few
incentives to share this information.
The penalties for making a mistake are more stringent
than the rewards for driving innovation.
An example of one of the many issues:

Because the two pharmacies aren’t connected, the first
pharmacy shows that the patient has abandoned their
prescription. Of the over 67,000 pharmacies in the U.S.,
approximately 40% are independent (5). This leads to the
acute problem of customer data loss, making it impossible
to truly track the patient’s journey.

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

Further, once the patient gets their prescription, they run
into a host of additional issues to continue their therapy as
the doctor prescribed. Such as the ability to pick up their
prescription monthly or remembering to take it in the first
place.
Access to accurate and timely data solves both of these
issues for patients, pharmacies and drug manufacturers.
With our current suite of products, ScriptDrop is in prime
position to drive down prescription abandonment and
improve medication adherence, saving lives and billions of
dollars for the U.S. taxpayer and healthcare system by
ensuring that patients will not abandon their medications
and seamlessly reminding them in their own home or care
environment.
Prescription delivery for patients focuses on abandonment
at the pharmacy. This is a critical step in ensuring that the
patient is adherent because they must be in possession of
their therapy to take it as prescribed.
Medication reminders focus on improving adherence. The
medication reminders initiate daily interactions with the
patient and allow for two-way communication without the
need for specialized software or any additional effort on
the part of the pharmacist or provider. ScriptDrop can
automatically identify if a patient is non-adherent, at which
time we send a message to the patient’s care team.

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

Blockchain technology is the key component for
healthcare innovation, by allowing secure, low cost
storage and sharing of patient healthcare information. The
CEO of Humana, one of the largest health plans in the
U.S., wrote an article on LinkedIn (6) to share some of his
thoughts on the potential.
To date, a lot of great ideas for healthcare innovation on
the blockchain have emerged. However, the largest
problem still remains. No healthcare entity has been
properly incentivized to post data to a new blockchain. In
fact, many of them have more to lose than to gain.
At ScriptDrop, we work from the bottom up to create a
shared, but secure, blockchain that will benefit everyone in
the patient’s healthcare continuum.
It all starts with that missing variable. The patient.
If Joe goes to one pharmacy, drops off a prescription,
doesn’t pick it up, but then goes into the next pharmacy to
get it filled, who best knows what happened? Joe does.
What’s the best way to facilitate communication between
non-related pharmacies that Joe has already picked up
the medication at a different pharmacy, and that the
expensive drug sitting on the shelf will never be paid for by
the patient?

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

5

As a patient, Joe doesn’t care. He doesn’t understand that
the first pharmacy paid to have the drug shipped to them
and it’s now sitting on their shelf costing them money each
day. Joe has no reason to call the first pharmacy and tell
them anything.
ScriptDrop’s daily interactions with patients help to solve
this. It incentivizes other participants in Joe’s care to post
to our blockchain and let everyone else know what
happened.
We know Joe. We’re interacting with him daily to tell him
when to take his medications. We know when and where
Joe is or isn’t getting his refill and we use this information
to make pharmacies more efficient and reduce wasted
drugs.
Ultimately, we’re driving costs down for all
participants, but most importantly the consumer.
How? We’re incentivizing Joe to interact with our
medication reminder platform, through our rewards based
system. Joe can use this to pay down his co-pay when he
gets a refill, make his monthly health premiums cheaper
and even turn his rewards into cash.
In turn, we post Joe’s adherence profile to our blockchain
and participants can glean insight to help them understand
where, when and for what reason they will interact with
Joe next.

2. Adherence and Token Blockchain

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

7

We will be using two concurrent blockchains. One is
based off of the Hyperledger framework, which we feel is
better for storing healthcare data and giving the power
back to the patient.
Why Hyperledger? It doesn’t require every peer to verify
every transaction and gives the patient the ability to
provision access to their own data. The patient will receive
a request from a covered entity and they can elect to
share the data or not.
It’s their choice. You can find more info on Hyperledger
and the framework here. The ScriptDrop team will be
leading the charge to write an Elixir SDK for Hyperledger.
It’s our base language and it makes sense for us to
continue utilizing it, in everything we do.
Our token will be running atop the Ethereum Blockchain.
Leading up the launch of the token sale, we will work with
a pharmacy and send a transaction through our network
and respond back with a co-pay buy down, using our
token.
We have a REST API to connect the two blockchains.

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

3. Healthcare Infrastructure and Patient Experience
To illustrate how a patient could abandon a prescription or
become non-adherent, it is helpful to see the moving parts
and patient interactions.
We will break this down into the healthcare professionals
that a patient would normally see to get a prescription
filled, the physician and pharmacist, and the systems that
they both use to enter data.
Physician: The physician is the person that typically
diagnoses the patient and writes the prescription. This can
also be done by a Nurse Practitioner (NP).
When arriving at the office, the physician will pull up the
patient’s chart in their Electronic Health Records System
(EHR). If they don’t have a computerized, they will pull a
traditional patient’s chart.
After the patient is diagnosed, the physician or NP writes a
prescription. The prescription can be written on paper or eprescribed.
In 2016, Surescripts, the largest processor of transactions
for e-prescriptions handled 10.9 billion transactions
through their network (7).

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

9

When prescriptions are written on paper, however, it
becomes another point of data loss. Surescripts is able to
track prescriptions that aren’t filled. That’s not the case
with hand written prescriptions.
From the physician’s office, the patient must go to the
pharmacy to pick up their prescription. It could be an
independent pharmacy, a chain (Walgreens, Kroger,
CVS), or the prescription could be mail-ordered to the
patient if they don’t need it immediately.
The two most likely scenarios driving a patient to have to
revisit the pharmacy after trying to pick up their medication
the first time are the medication is not being in stock or a
prior authorization (PA) being required. A PA is the payer
or PBM’s request for additional info on that prescription
and patient’s therapy.
The medication might not be in stock because of limited
distribution or the pharmacy simply doesn’t want to carry
the cost of the drug and risk it sitting on the shelves. The
pharmacist would then order the drug from their preferred
wholesaler. The primary wholesalers in the U.S. are
McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen.
The patient would then return the next day and pick up
their prescription. The issue is this doesn’t always happen.
In fact, 25% of the time the patient doesn’t return, due to
frustration or co-pay sensitivity.
Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

10

The second situation outlined above is much more
complex and is even more frustrating for the patient. When
the pharmacist attempts to get a paid claim from the payer
Prescription Benefits Manager (PBM), they sometimes
receive a rejection for a PA. A Prior Authorization is a
request for more info on the patient’s previous therapies,
that particular prescription, and why it is needed.
The time to resolution for a PA can vary depending on a
number of factors that the patient doesn’t control, nor do
they have insight into. The PBM may also reject the
prescription after the PA has been filled out.
This situation can add an additional seven days from the
time the patient was prescribed the medication, to the time
they pick it up that the pharmacy.
ScriptDrop’s founding team worked at a company that
helped pharmacies, physicians and patients with the PA
process. So, the process and the burden to each of the
stakeholders is second nature to them.
When a prescription is being billed to the patient’s PBM it
is entered into a pharmacy system. The largest pharmacy
systems are PDX, QS/1, and Rx30. There are a number of
others that are growing quickly, such as BestRx and
PioneerRx. Most of the pharmacy chains have their own
proprietary system. The pharmacy system then sends the
Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

11

transaction to the switch, which communicates with the
PBM. The switch side is an oligopoly, that is dominated by
two players (Relay Health and eRx). Their function is
similar to a clearinghouse. They send a request to a
patient’s PBM to see if a prescription is covered and what
cost will fall to the patient. They then send back the
response to the pharmacy. The pharmacy system then
renders the response in their proprietary software.
Whether the transaction travels over Relay Health’s
network or eRx’s can create another data loss/refusal to
share issue.
The different PBM’s and whether the patient has Medicare
or Medicaid can determine the co-pay amount the patient
must pay, before gaining possession of the prescription.
CVS Caremark conducted a study and found that “patients
having a co-pay of $50 are almost four times more likely to
abandon a prescription at a pharmacy than those paying
$10 (8).”
The various points of friction for a patient, little insight into
what is really going on, and co-pay sensitivity lead to 50%
of patients becoming non-adherent at some point in their
treatment (9).

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

12

An even worse number of patients surveyed --75%-admitted to not taking their therapy as their doctor
prescribed (10).
Because of our industry knowledge and strategic
partnerships developed over decades of work in the
industry, ScriptDrop initiates a prescription delivery and
automates patient medication reminders seamlessly at
various points in the process.
Because of the data we collect, we are able to report
trends to everyone in the ScriptDrop pipeline, as we
interact with the patient. Over time, we customize the
patient’s experience and lower the cost of healthcare for
everyone by making everyone from patients to pharmacies
more efficient. All this moves us toward our goal of saving
as many of the 125,000 lives lost to prescription
abandonment and non-adherence as we possibly can.
Bottom line, the ScriptDrop Blockchain truly improves
healthcare for everyone involved.

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

13

Below we show the patient journey and various behind the
scenes data transactions for a prescription:

4. Governance and Standards for Data in Healthcare

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

14

There are two data formats with which ScriptDrop needs
to interact with to achieve success.
Health Level-7(HL7) and National Council for Prescription
Drug Programs(NCPDP) drive most of the data protocols
throughout the U.S.
HL7 is the protocol for physicians and NCPDP is the
standard protocol for e-prescriptions and pharmacy claims
submission.
Both the ScriptDrop services detailed earlier are live with a
number of pharmacies in the U.S. and we’ve built those
transmissions based on the specifications of NCPDP.
This format allows us to quickly integrate with most eprescribing systems, with little to no modifications.
Because of our intimate knowledge of the pharmacy
sector, gained through years of experience working in the
industry, we are able to work within any pharmacy in the
U.S. without the need for the pharmacist to download an
app. This effortless integration has rapidly driven demand
for our services across the US.
Our founding team has participated in NCPDP workgroups
in the past and will stay active within them for the
foreseeable future. This gives us an advantage to
understand upcoming changes and gives us a voice in
guiding that change.
Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

15

In addition to seamlessly integrating with most pharmacy
systems, ScriptDrop also works with Updox, which works
with a robust network of physicians and EHR systems, as
outlined here. Updox has partnered with ScriptDrop to
communicate patient non-adherence seamlessly back to
everyone in the patient’s care team. If you would like to
read more about our partnership, you can do so by
reading this press release.
We’ve come together to communicate with one another in
a proprietary manner that integrates data gathered from
an HL7 transmission and an NCPDP transmission. We
then combine that with the one-to-one patient interactions
that ScriptDrop has with the patient.

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

Snapshot of the partnership and workflow:

4.1 HIPAA
Compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, is essential to any
company in the health care industry. HIPAA, through its
implementing Privacy Rule and Security Rule, mandates
that the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient
protected health information (“PHI”) be protected, that PHI
be used only for legitimate health care purposes, and that
health care companies maintain privacy and security
standards sufficient to ensure these protections.

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

17

ScriptDrop has the expertise and experience to ensure
that its products and services remain HIPAA compliant. It
enters into a formal relationship as a business associate
(BA), or service vendor to health care providers, with the
other parties in its ecosystem (such as pharmacies and
health care providers, attesting to them that it will abide by
HIPAA standards and best practices to safeguard their
patients’ PHI.
Its software systems and business
procedures are designed from the ground up to fully
comply with Security Rule requirements, and it maintains a
vendor management program to supervise its own
downstream business associates for compliance.
In addition, ScriptDrop’s technology permits it to offer
innovative new services to patients while still satisfying
privacy and security regulations.
By receiving and
maintaining patient consent for direct communication, and
maintaining a secure end-to-end communication channel
through HIPAA-compliant cloud storage and data
processing infrastructure through its own business
associate, Amazon Web Services, ScriptDrop is able to
securely transmit and receive PHI via in-home voice
communications with patients, and pass it on to its health
care provider partners.
Its control over the entire
communication channel ensures for its partners that
ScriptDrop’s services are a secure, scalable, and
compliant way to directly improve patient adherence.

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

5. ScriptDrop’s Token (Adherence Token, AHC)
ScriptDrop’s token will primarily be used to incentivize
patients for medication adherence and their continued
interaction with our app.
Tokens are marketed to patients through our delivery and
medication reminder products. When patients utilize either
service, they are prompted to sign up and interact with our
app either on their smartphone or natively through SMS.
Onboarding is seamless for medication reminders for
patients, because we already have their prescription data
(including drug, quantity dispensed, and days’ supply).
After onboarding, patients begin receiving daily medication
reminders. As the patient interacts, they are rewarded with
ScriptDrop tokens. These tokens are used to buy down
patient co-pays for their subsequent refill. Similarly,
patients can earn more tokens by referring friends and
family to sign up.
The number of tokens awarded to patients is based on a
number of factors. The inputs are placed into our
proprietary distribution algorithm, and cannot be shared
publicly due to sensitive nature of the rewards program.
One of the inputs is the type of drug and the disease state
in which it treats.

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

19

“For diabetes patients, every additional dollar spent on
medication saved $7 in medical costs. Diabetes patients
who are highly compliant with their treatment programs
have a 13 percent hospitalization risk for a diabetesrelated problem, but patients with low compliance have
more than twice the risk at 30 percent. (11)”
A comprehensive study conducted by the American
Diabetes Association in 2012 found that the disease costs
the healthcare system $322 billion annually (12).
Our token system takes those factors into account as we
interact with patients and help to improve their medication
adherence. Because of our seamless integration with
pharmacies across the U.S., we are able to use the tokens
to buy down patient co-pays and make the process
seamless for them as well. As the pharmacist sends a
transaction to us with the co-pay that is due, we use the
patient’s token balance to buy down their co-pay.
This is when reconciliation is performed, and the patient’s
adherence profile is posted to the blockchain for that
month.
ScriptDrop knows when the drug was first dispensed, has
the patient daily interactions, and has confirmation of the
refill date. If all three factors align, the patient receives a
bonus allotment of tokens. Regardless of bonus, their
adherence profile is posted onto the blockchain.

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

20

Our token functions as a co-pay/voucher program for
pharmaceutical manufacturers. We implement a hybrid
model, where the pharmaceutical companies can
purchase a portion of the Adherence Tokens on an open
exchange and a portion directly from us to target patients.
Once the pharmaceutical company has the tokens, we
work with them to build an ideal patient profile and allocate
the tokens in accordance with their standards. There will
always exist a middle-layer between the pharmaceutical
manufacturer and the patient. ScriptDrop occupies that
area and makes modifications to the ideal patient profile
for a manufacturer, as new trends emerge from our daily
patient interactions.
The co-pay card industry is huge business. According to
FiercePharma, “method was responsible for $7 billion in
spending in 2015 (13).”

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

21

5.1 Proof of Act
Patients receive tokens from the Proof of Act (PoA). That
is based on the daily interactions with our medication
reminder and getting their refill on the appropriate date.
The efficacy of each drug is variable. The patient reward
system will account for that.
As patients interact with our app and unlock token
rewards, everyone wins. The patient is more likely to stay
adherent and get their refill on time. The cost of healthcare
goes down, as well as lost lives.
It is difficult for the patient to hack or “game” this system.
The transactions to get them setup must originate from the
pharmacy. Those transactions come in through an API
integration we have with partners.

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

22

5.2 Smart Contracts and Team Vesting
ScriptDrop team tokens will vest over time to align
incentives for the successful implementation of our token
and its underlying ecosystem.
Tokens for the ScriptDrop team vest over three years, with
a 1-year cliff.
This will be written into the Smart Contract and verified by
an independent auditor.

5.3 Token Breakdown

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

24

5.4 Funding Goal Breakdown
Our token sale will have a minimum, goal, and stretch
goal. Covered in the previous graphic, our token price will
be $.07 for the first 250MM and $.09 for the next 160MM.

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

25

**If we hit our stretch goal, we will use a portion of the
funds to film a documentary on how blockchain will
fundamentally change healthcare. **

This addition was based off of community feedback. Our
team knows healthcare. We have a great network and the
contacts to get the correct people on record. We want to
bring attention to the blockchain industry, as a whole.
More specifically, tell the story of how it is already
beginning to change the dynamics of healthcare.

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

26

5.5 Budget Breakdown
For our investors agreeing to take this risk, they will
receive back a cash payment after the successful token
sale. This one-time event shows up on the Year One
Budget. We’ve taken community feedback and our current
investors will not receive a token allocation.

Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

27

The above budget breakdown covers employee overhead,
HIPAA compliant office space, and paying to get
partnerships expedited. We are a cash-flow positive
company, with growing revenue.
We have built out a file of the targeted positions, post
token sale close. One of note is we will be bringing on an
economist. This role will help us to move our BTC/ETH
assets over to USD in a thoughtful and strategic way. Our
team weren’t fans of the flash crashes caused by large
and successful token sales this year, once they sold off all
of the crypto assets they had raised.
We believe in the future of the technology and industry
and would prefer to hold onto our BTC/ETH longer.
Our economist will also have a hand in helping to
distribute our Adherence Tokens to patients in a data
driven manner. All in all, a very important position to our
company’s future and the future of healthcare.

7. Product History & Roadmap
The ScriptDrop suite of services includes Delivery,
Medication Reminders, Patient Rewards System and our
Smart Pillbox. The following will explain the way these
programs work together and compile the ScriptDrop
ecosystem.
7.1 Delivery (Patent Pending)

ScriptDrop
was
originally
founded
to
solve
the
prescription delivery problem
which plagued the pharmacy
and
pharmaceutical
industries.
Patients frequently go to a pharmacy to pick up their
prescription only to find that they must wait for 24 hours or
more to pick it up. They never return.
This event has been referred to numerous times in this
White Paper and is called Prescription Abandonment. With
our experience integrating into pharmacy systems and
understanding the importance of pharmacy workflows, we
have been able to build a valuable solution for pharmacies
in a proprietary way. We have provisional patent
applications pending on several of our processes, and
we’re actively pursuing full patent grants.
Copyright ScriptDrop 2017

32

Our service and software is compatible with EVERY
pharmacy in the United States.
We’re currently integrated with couriers in 42 states,
currently. Our footprint encompasses about 350 different
courier companies. We don’t onboard a courier company
until we ensure they are HIPAA compliant.
7.2 Medication Reminders (Patent Pending)

The
genesis
of
medication
reminders came from a client
challenge. They asked us, “what can
you do for the patient after they sign
for the delivery?”
At that point, we already had the patient’s prescription
data and could use that data in a more actionable way.
We realized this also opened us up to a much larger
population of patients. ScriptDrop could help patients that
didn’t get a delivery through our network. The medication
reminder transaction is also sent the same way as the
delivery request, at the pharmacy. We’d laid the tracks
and could repurpose the end product, after request intake.

Our medication reminders are a frictionless patient
experience. There is no need for the patient to tell us
anything about their prescription, other than the time that
they’d like the reminders. We know the drug and how long
they should get the reminders for that fill. We even know
their pharmacy and physician contact info, in the event
that we need to facilitate a conversation.
We’re piloting this now with a control group of pharmacies,
through a direct integration we have with a pharmacy
system.
We’ve built it out so that the patient can customize their
experience and what medium they’d like to receive the
reminders. Here is a promo video that shows the patient
experience and introduces Mary.

Mary reminds patients to take their
medication at the appropriate time.
Onboarding for the patient is seamless
because of the integrations outlined
earlier in this paper. We have their
prescription info in the transaction that
was sent by the pharmacy.

Mary functions as the patient’s Medication AI Assistant.

7.3 Patient Rewards System
This is outlined extensively above. The driver behind it is
another question a client asked us, “what’s in it for the
patient to tell your app they’ve taken their prescription?”
You have to implement an incentive structure for the
patient to interact with the app or it drives no value to
anyone in the network.
Our patient reward system gamifies medication adherence
in a tracked and measurable manner.
Deloitte conducted a study and found, “Gamification
boosts medication adherence, which empowers patients
and presents opportunities for healthcare cost reduction
(14).”
The key isn’t only the gamification. It’s the combination of
gamification and a near frictionless onboarding process.
The patient isn’t just rewarded for picking up their
prescription. They are rewarded for interacting with the
app, which creates a feedback loop to their entire care
network. The daily interactions and the trends that will be
uncovered won’t only help with customizing treatment for
patients, it can be used to track the efficacy of certain
drugs, drill down on the timing of the onset of side effects,
and numerous other opportunities.

7.4 Smart Pillbox (Patent Pending)
We’ve also developed a smart pillbox that can have data
sent directly to it, through our network. The pillbox would
then be able to track the patient’s adherence through twoway verbal communication and sensors.
This was included in our provisional patent application.
Our legal team has advised us this has the best chance of
getting a patent granted. After we have it production ready
and a patent granted, we will file for FDA approval as a
Class 1 Medical Device.
If we win the classification, our smart pillbox can be billed
to the patient’s health plan. This product will give
ScriptDrop a new and innovative way to impact patient
care.
We anticipate an easier route than most to get the
classification because we will have tangible patient data
and interactions through our Med Reminder service. Think
of the Smart Pillbox as an extension of Mary.
As one physician told us, “if you get this classified as a
Class 1 Medical Device and insurance to cover it, I’ll
prescribe it to every chronic patient I treat.”

Introduction

In the last few years eSports have become extremely popular with the media. The number of
players and fans, prize funds and budgets of competitions have demonstrated a significant
growth. We invite you to take part in this growth with us.
The story begins in 2011, when Valve introduced an opportunity to exchange and trade in-game
items (skins) from the popular CS:GO, Dota 2, and other video games based on the official Steam
trading platform. Very soon skins were not just in-game items, but in fact became an actual
currency: a lot of online services started to accept them as a payment method, exchange them for
real money and other skins, or use them as bets on betting platforms. Thus, the skins market
emerged, and has grown up to more than $7 billion in a few years.
Our main product under this ICO is creating an exchange service with a convenient API for
connecting to the third party websites, so that they can accept payments in SKINCOIN without
having to open and maintain their own stores.
We are creating a platform for immediate exchange of skins for the cryptocurrency, which is a
liquid asset that can be used for further skins speculative trading, replace the turnover of skins on
video game websites and can be used for conversion of the income after trading skins into fiat
money. For that, we need a working capital that will be used to execute the obligations between
a seller and a buyer of the skin, and also a marketing budget to scale the project.
We are an experienced team working in the skins market for many years, we have created and
maintained such projects as Steamtrade.net, Skinwin.com and Case.club. Our advantage is that
right after the ICO, SKINCOIN (SKIN) will be integrated into our and our partners’ game projects
that include skin trading.
SKINCOIN (SKIN) – tokens are to be released based on the Ethereum blockchain platform.
All proceeds from the release of tokens in the ICO shall be used to finance further development,
support, marketing of new gaming projects: trading platforms and gaming services associated
with items from games like CS:GO, Dota2 and Team Fortress 2.

1.1 What are the skins?
Skins are virtual items that can be used in games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO),
Dota 2, Team Fortress 2. The term “skin” is derived from the typical function of these virtual items:
changing the appearance of a player’s in-game avatar, weapons, or equipment.
For example: below is an image of the “stock” gun used as a weapon in CS:GO. Players can opt to
replace that stock gun with unique skins of the gun that change the appearance of the gun, as
shown in the images.

CS:GO - Gun without skin and with skin

Note that the skins do not improve the functionality or power of the gun. The skin only changes
the appearance of the gun. Skins play a purely cosmetic role.
As the CS:GO market is the primary one and holds 80% of the industry, we will further focus on
this game.

1.2 How the skins market emerged
The skins market began to grow and develop rapidly after Valve introduced an opportunity to
exchange and sell skins to other players. A player could use the skin in the game itself, by
installing it for his character; sell it on a trading platform or pass it on to another player as a
means of exchange or as a gift via Steam’s API. A great number of players wanted to profit from
the skins’ liquidity by selling or exchanging the items as if it was the stock market. Rare and
unique skins acquired a status of collectors’ skins and now their price may exceed the amount of
$10,000.
Today there are several ways of getting a skin in CS:GO:





Receiving them during gameplay;
Receiving them as a promotional giveaway (often around major CS:GO events);
Trading with other players;
Purchasing skins on a variety of marketplaces.

Not only the opportunity to show off a unique skin in the game made the skins popular, but
also the possibility of using them as a payment method on plenty of video game websites.
4

Originally, it was only allowed to sell the skins on the official Steam trading platform, however
the problem was that it was impossible to withdraw money from the platform. The money
received from selling the skins on Steam could only be used to buy other skins or other games
on the same platform. The problem was solved by many emerging services which offered more
convenient and attractive options of using the skins, thus forming a new market outside Steam.
Besides, an impulse for the skins market development and their popularity was given by various
gaming services. Accepting the skins as a payment method, they soon became popular, gained
their huge loyal audience, increased the demand for the skins enormously and brought this
market to a new level.
This is how it works:

Players “deposit” a skin at a skin-gaming site by transferring the skin to the skin gaming
site;

They gamble using their deposited skins (or in some sort of internal currency that the
player receives in exchange for their skin);

If they win, they’re paid in additional skins, which they “cash out” by requesting that the
skin gaming site transfer skins back to the player.

1.3 The size of the skins market and its trends
In recent years, eSports games have gained immense popularity and were covered by major
media. The most popular games are CS:GO and Dota 2, they are also the most profitable in the
market. A last major tournament at the National Wide Arena (where the NHL Blue Jackets play) in
1

April 2016 generated more than 71 million online views in four days. A huge number of games
and tournaments are broadcasted by streaming services such as Twitch and YouTube.
Each day more than 400-450 thousand people play in CS:GO simultaneously, for Dota 2 this figure
is more than 750-800 thousand people.

On picture illustrated statistic on 2017-06-17_15-00

The number of players and people who have bought these games grows every year. At the
beginning of 2014 there were 26 million of them in Dota2 and only 12 million in CS:GO (according
to ARS Technica). Now, according to Steam Spy, more than 104 million users have installed Dota2
and more than 29 million – CS:GO.

Statistic from Steam Spy, look column Owners2

As Narus Advisors reports, the size of
the market amounted to about $7.4
billion in 2016. This is the total sum of
bets made in skins by players all over
the world.
According to Eilers&Krejcik, more than
3 million people have made their bets
on the results of eSports games with
skins worth $2.3 billion during 2015.
Despite the fact that this kind of bets
can hardly be considered mainstream
or
be
compared
with
the
cryptocurrency market, the growth of
the skin gambling market is really
fascinating: more than 300% in 2016
compared to 2015.
The market for skin gambling is
distributed across a handful of
dominant products.
Sportsbook-style betting (wagers on
esports matches) is the largest
vertical. The second most popular is
jackpot-style
games,
essentially
lotteries where players receive tickets
based on the value of their deposited
skins. Simple forms of roulette
games, coin flip games, and blackjack
games make up much of the
remaining turnover.
In terms of market participants, the
skin gambling industry grew quickly
from a handful to hundreds of sites in
the course of a year. The vast majority
of those sites were variations on the
basic jackpot product theme.
Ultimately, we believe the bulk of
handle in the skin gaming industry

was generated by roughly fifteen sites.
Google trends proves strong demand in the skins market and the growth of interest in this
market.

The skins market problems and their solutions

2.1 What problems are there in the skins market?
In 2011 Valve Corporation launched a service for Steam users to exchange in-game items
for games with built-in economy.
In 2016, the Washington State Gambling Commission demanded that Valve developers
stop supporting gambling related to games’ items and the Steam platform.
The government organization that manages all gambling activities in the state where
Valve is located said that Gabe Newell's company “has until October 14, 2016 to respond
and explain how it is in full compliance with Washington’s gambling laws or it will risk
having the Gambling Commission take additional civil or criminal action against the
company.”
According to the press release, the organization contacted Valve in February to find a
solution for the problem of betting skins when users used virtual items, like gambling
chips in a casino, instead of real money.
The legal sports analytical agency published a report on the activities of the largest portal
CS:GO Lounge, which deals with betting on events in e-sports. According to the report,
from January to August 2016, the site has accepted more than 103 million skins worth
about 1 billion dollars. The average total cost of bets on one game was 358 thousand
dollars.
July 13, 2016 Eric Johnson, director of marketing operations of Valve, published a letter
on the Steam website in which he stated that there is no link between Valve Corporation
and online services using Valve's system of exchanging items for their own commercial
purposes. Johnson also said that Valve never received any profit from the actions of such
sites. He added also, that there was no plug-ins for converting skins into real money in
Steam. He said that developers of online casinos used the OpenID API and network calls
similar to those of Steam users to conduct their business, which contradicts the terms of
the Steam Subscriber Agreement. It was announced that Valve was going to send out
warning letters to all identified sites of this kind.
In August 2016, Valve made a newsletter to popular sites that use skins as bets. Some of
the gambling sites switched to skins trading or to bets with virtual currency, not violating
the Steam Subscriber Agreement.
In particular, the largest gambling portal CS: GO Lounge received a ban from Valve on the
skin gambling activity. At the end of September 2016, the portal resumed its activity by
introducing the system of inner currency in the form of coins (points), which does not
violate the policy of Steam.

9

2.2 How we suggest to solve these problems
There is a solution to this problem. A lot of video game websites began to adopt a new business
model by introducing the system of inner currency of coins (points). The skins are exchanged for
a particular number of points and the bets are made not with skins but with points, which
doesn’t break the law or the Steam Subscriber Agreement. To use the points on their websites,
one has to first change them into skins in an inner store.
At any time the player can change his points into the skins and withdraw them from the website.
But the changed business model led to another problem in the skins market. The points from one
platform can’t be used outside this platform, other sites or exchange services will not accept them.
The value of points outside one particular platform is equal to zero. This adds unnecessary steps
and makes the trading process more complicated.
By introducing the cryptocurrency SKINCOIN into the gaming industry we solve the problem of
convenience and safety when it comes to the gaming services. This will protect all types of gaming
platforms as well as exchange services from Valve claims and blocking of accounts on Steam.
Cryptocurrency SKINCOIN does not qualify as a payment method in the usual sense. This protects
SKINCOIN from claims of the regulatory and other governmental institutions.
For introducing SKINCOIN into the current gaming system we are going to launch a service with
a convenient API for the immediate exchange of skins into SKINCOIN and vice versa. On the
exchange website there will be a huge range of the skins to exchange. By using the API of our
exchanging service, third party websites will be able to accept SKINCOIN as a payment method,
gradually replacing the skins turnover. All the transactions on the gaming websites will be in
SKINCOIN and the website owners won’t have to maintain their stores filled with skins to keep
their site efficient.

2.3. Competitive advantages
A lot of cryptocurrencies have been created in the market. Mainly these cryptocurrencies are
offered to be used under one service or product. What is the difference between SKINCOIN and
its equivalents?
SKINCOIN is created to change the current system of video game services and replace the coins
(points) of different gambling services with skins trading operations. This can be done thanks to
an important quality: any skin can be immediately exchanged for SKINCOIN at a stated price
and vice versa. The client will not have to wait for the next suitable contractor to appear for the
deal. Implementation of SKINCOIN as a universal coin for video game websites will greatly
simplify the skins trading process.
We are going to simplify the whole process of interaction with websites by implementing
SKINCOIN as an alternative to points (coins) of different gambling services. Our team has rich
experience in creating and developing trading platforms for in-game items which will be the base
for launching the exchange service of the skins and SKINCOIN.

10

Since 2013 we have launched the following projects:
STEAMTRADE (Steamtrade.net) – trading platform for in-game items from Steam
Supported games: CS:GO, Dota 2, Team Fortress 2.
STEAMTRADE allows to sell items “in a few clicks”. All purchased items are combined into one
singular trade according to the exchange offer from Steam. Thus the client doesn’t have to
approve every single transaction which could suggest great difficulties for wholesale traders. Our
competitors don’t have this solution yet.
Daily turnover: 15 000+ transactions.
SKINWIN (Skinwin.com) – gaming platform with different types of games. The bets can be made
with skins and their own points.
Daily turnover: 8 000+ transactions.
CASECLUB (Case.club) – a shop of “random” skins for CS:GO. The service allows to “open” the
cases from CS:GO directly on the website and use them in the game at once. This way of “case
opening” gained great popularity in 2013. Our team was the first one to launch websites
(Case.club (former Countershop.ru), Dotashop.net) for opening CS:GO and Dota 2 cases outside
of Steam. Before that it was only possible to open cases inside Steam.
Daily turnover: 2 500+ transactions.
As you can see, we are not launching the SKINCOIN project from scratch. We already have a lot
of experience in the development and promotion of gaming services as well as a strong team of
developers.
Tokens trading with SKINCOIN is planned to be implemented into the infrastructure of our already
operating projects. This will allow to get the approved infrastructural demand for SKINCOIN
tokens.
The most important competitors of SKINCOIN are:



FIRST BLOOD (http://firstblood.io/)
ROUNDCOIN (http://roundcoin.org/)

Both projects involve creating competitive modes and hosting games with the help of blockchain.
The problem of these competitors is that the decentralized matchmaking (competitive regime
according to which the winning side gets a prize in the form of tokens) doesn’t have the
monetization of the leading game services and trading platforms. We, on the other hand, have a
ready backend and are able to launch a similar service in a couple of months. However, the low
monetization of matchmaking services makes us focus on more global issues.
As you can see from the list above – our product is a unique service which has not been
implemented by other market players. Our distinction is that we do not launch a cryptocurrency
for one particular product. We are creating a whole infrastructure for the trading of skins which
includes a big number of various services and monetization possibilities.

11

Potential partners of SKINCOIN:
OPSKINS (www.opskins.com)
A platform for CS: GO skins trading. Potential partner for implementing SKINCOIN.
BITSKINS (https://bitskins.com)
A platform for CS: GO skins trading. Has a possibility to accept payments in BTC. Has its own API
connector. Potential partner for implementing SKINCOIN.
LOOTMARKET (https://www.lootmarket.com)
A platform for CS: GO and Dota 2 skins trading. Potential partner for implementing SKINCOIN.
CSGO (https://csgo.tm/)
A biggest platform for CS: GO skins trading for the Russian market.
SKIN HUNT (www.skin-hunt.com/)
A platform for CS: GO skins trading localized for the Russian market.
CSGODEP (www.csgodep.com/)
A service for matchmaking. A potential partner for implementing bets in SKINCOIN.
We are creating a system in which all the platforms listed above will be able to participate in a
united process of trading. With the help of our API system any platform will be able to quickly
integrate the SKINCOIN trading into their services. This will guarantee the raise of total skins
market liquidity and furthermore will lead to the SKINCOIN price increase.

ICO

3.1. ICO Goals
Our idea is to create a platform of immediate exchange of the skins for cryptocurrency which is a
liquid asset that can further be used in a skins speculative trading, replace the skins on gaming
services or be used in conversion of the income received from selling the skins.
To do so, we need the working capital for executing obligations of sellers and buyers of the skins,
as well as the marketing capital which will allow operating the project at scale.
We expect our project to be appealing for the members of the crypto-community, who will be
able to participate in the market growth with their investments, as well as for the members of the
Steam-community, who will take part in building the new market infrastructure.

3.2. ICO parameters

Why contribute in SKINCOIN

The number of issued tokens is limited by 1 000 000 000 SKIN. The additional emission of tokens
is forbidden. All the unplaced tokens are to be destroyed.
After the ICO we plan to implement the payments in SKINCOIN on Steamtrade.net, Skinwin.com,
Case.club, Skin-hunt.com, Csgodep.com. We forecast that these platforms together will offer the
demand of up to 50% of the total cost of the publicly traded tokens.
We forecast to occupy the 10% skins market share (approximately $700 million). Therefore, the
demand for tokens can potentially outpace the value of publicly traded tokens by 20 times.
The purchase of SKINCOIN at ICO gives you an opportunity to enter the infrastructure project
with twentyfold potential value growth at a low cost.
After ICO SKINCOIN will be available for purchase in cryptocurrency exchanges (we are
negotiating with Bittrex).

4.1. Roadmap and Development plan
Our main product under this ICO is creating an exchange service to change skins into SKINCOIN
and vice versa with a convenient API for connecting to the third party websites, so that they can
accept payments in SKINCOIN without having to open and maintain their own stores. We simplify
the whole process of the skins exchange and solve the problem of the exchange speed as well as
significantly expand the range of the available skins.
- In July 2017, we are launching the first decentralized SKINCOIN crypto currency for buying,
selling skins, and gaming services. SKINCOIN will solve the problem of the diversity of domestic
currencies for gambling websites and the lack of real value of coins beyond their limits.
- In July 2017, all our projects (Steamtrade.net, Skinwin.com, Case.club and Dotashop.net) will
begin to use SKINCOIN, which will guarantee the demand for it.
- In August 2017, we launch the main platform for exchanging SKINCOIN for skins. Users will be
able to instantly exchange skins for SKINCOIN and back at any time.
- After the launch of the exchange platform, an API will be developed for receiving and converting
skins in SKINCOIN (SKIN) for third-party websites, related to CS: GO, Dota 2 and Team Fortress 2.
After the API is available for our partners we are going to focus on the partners’ base enlargement
covered by the budget and our competitive advantages. That will boost our market share and
raise the demand for SKINCOIN.

15

5.

Some technical aspects of the exchange service’s API

All the platforms that have connected to the API of our exchange service, will get an opportunity
to quickly receive payments and make all transactions with the users in SKINCOIN. The user can
top up his balance on the website and his exchange interface with the inventory will be
downloaded through the API. By choosing the necessary number of items the user immediately
exchanges his skins via our service and we transfer SKINCOIN to the balance of the user on our
partner’s website. Right after this the user will be able to make all the transactions on the third
party website in SKINCOIN.
The rate of SKINCOIN on trading platforms and exchanges will be calculated as the median stock
market rate of the major cryptocurrency stock markets. The exchange rates of skins will be
updated every 2 hours. This is done to avoid clients’ risks which has to minimize abrupt changes
of the price.
A special wallet will be created for a convenient storage of SKINCOIN. With its help it will be easy
to transfer SKINCOIN between different trading platforms, stock exchange, exchange points and
game services.

Identification on the exchange platforms will be possible through the Steam account. In fact, the
buyer will be able to buy a skin with SKINCOIN and immediately use it in the gaming process.
Besides, the instructions will be created for the users and our partners, which will thoroughly
describe the opportunities by the SKINCOIN project and how to use them.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. What is SONM
SONM is a decentralized worldwide fog supercomputer for general purpose computing from site hosting to scientific calculations. SONM company is an effective way to solve a worldwide problem - creating a multi-purpose
decentralized computational power market.
Unlike widespread centralized cloud services, SONM project implements a fog computing[1] structure – a decentralized pool of devices, all of which are connected to the internet (IoT / Internet of Everything).
IoT/IoE, as an important part of the available computational power in the world, is one of the key directions of
work for the SONM project. (See further, chapter 2.1)
We use cost-efficient fog computing instead of a costly cloud structure, so there is no more need to pay in advance for private and monopolized cloud computing such as with Amazon, Microsoft, Google Cloud, etc. Moreover, since SONM is fully decentralized, there is no single authority that regulates computing resource distribution.
SONM has a hybrid architecture, and therefore supports any kind of computational task without facing Ethereum’s
“out of gas” problem.
From a technical point of view, SONM is a top layer of underlying P2P technologies – BTSync for data transfer,
Cocaine open source PaaS technology as a decentralized computing platform, and Ethereum Smart Contracts as
a consensus system.
There is no central control behind the system and no backdoors or escape hatches. Several existing technologies
were combined and modified by our developers to make new SOSNA technology.
In terms of providing distributed value for investors, SONM uses its own token SNM, based on Ethereum’s blockchain. (click to read SONM token description in Business Overview).
Almost every online service needs computational power for their product, including websites, online shops,
MMORPGs, companies using large databases, and apps. Everyone in the world using the internet for business will
have an option to use SONM’s tokens in order to solve their computing power issues. Moreover, all internet users
will be able to use SONM to receive passive income by providing their computational resources for rent.
This disruptive migration from centralized cloud computing to decentralized fog computing will not happen quickly: it will be a long transition, but the results will be positive. SONM token price calculations show decent ROI for
the project’s early adopters.
SONM token price is supported by stable market demand for computing power and ability to provide more competitive prices than traditional cloud computing services. SONM token holders earn a percentage from transactions and operations fees (buy-sell-develop). It is a direct analogue of holding shares and receiving dividends from
operational profit.
If you are a miner or computational power owner, SONM is a great resource of using your equipment for calculations and processing real tasks.
SONM fog computing platform is a fresh start for solo mining. There are lots of miners with GPU mining farms
that have become useless due to the increased Proof-of-work mining difficulty (even for altcoins). In recent years,
being a part of a mining pool has been the only way to guarantee profit from mining. But even in the process, this
profit is so small that it often does not cover the cost of electricity spent for PoW mining.

5

SONM platform is the efficient solution for miners. (click to read chapter Goverance in BO)
With SONM you will stop burning your kilowatts for PoW mining and start serving calculations for everyone
in the network. For those who are confused by the difficulty bomb or Ethereum (and many others) PoS-migration - each miner is suggested most profitable applications and tasks for their hardware. CPU, GPU,
ASIC, and even gaming consoles and smartphones can be used for SONM fog computing. All you need to
do is to set up a mining client application and run it.
SONM is a Multi-agent system, so each user will able to use intelligent agents and smart-contracts to
maximize profit. You can set your automatization level by choosing each project manually with one-click
settings. The SONM system will then automatically pick the most profitable project for your equipment,
work with it and receive payouts to your personal Ethereum address.
SONM is easy to setup and use, both for miners and computing power buyers. There is no need to have
advanced IT skills or to hire an IT specialist if you use SONM — our self-learning system finds the most
profitable task for miner’s equipment (and vice versa for buyers). The network also runs this task with no
need to set up and support a dedicated server.
SONM is Self-learning and totally safe for its users. Our system supports anonymity tools like proxy, VPN
or TOR, but it can’t be used as a hacker dream toolkit. Intelligent agents are able to self-educate using
neural networks and keep malicious users out of the system, while at the same time providing the most
efficient task solution - both for miners and computational power buyers.
SONM computing power exchange is the free market, so malicious hubs and users will shortly be ignored
by buyers and miners due to their bad reputation. (link to 2.8 Safety and Security)
We expect SONM to be the smartest, cheapest and largest decentralized computing system with strong
rules regarding morality and loyalty. This is largely due to SONM’s reputation system and self-learning
intelligent agents.

1.2. SONM Use Cases
We have experience with the limitations of BOINC itself – it is scientific software and supports only C++/
FORTRAN/Python, therefore it is not flexible. We started using more advanced solutions like Cocaine and
Docker container (which support more languages, including Java, Node.js, Go and etc.) We decided that
we will go the other way, and will focus more not just on the distributed calculations field like BOINC does,
but more on fog computing. This way, we can build a more universal platform not only for scientific calculations. The flexibility of the SONM platform and its multi-purposeness is knit to PoE for non-deterministic
task which is a unique technology owned by SONM (Proof of Execution).

1.2.1. Scientific projects
SONM network can be used to run essential scientific calculations requiring massive computing
power, for example:
• drug development
• modelling
• meteor trajectory modelling

• bioinformatics
• aerodynamic calculations

• social statistics
• climate predictio

There are several major areas where large computer capacity is needed.
Usually in case of computationally-intensive methods, or (and) tasks with huge input data requirements.
Molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics are examples of such kind of computationally-intensive
methods. Molecular dynamics is a computational experiment to study small molecules behaviour and
intermolecular interactions. The largest computer power is required to model the interaction between new
medicines and biological targets.
Molecular dynamics is also helpful in studying the fermentation mechanisms. Relevant programmes are
carried out to model the enzymes behaviour depending on temperature, presence of solvent, pressure and
another parameters. The system complexity is proportional to the number of modelled particles and also
to complexity of their representation.
For example, the system complexity and estimated time will grow exponentially, along with increasing of
protein amount, modelled system volume (the number of water molecules around proteins) and complexity of water models. However, molecular dynamics is based on the using the methods and approaches of
molecular mechanics, and does not take into account the quantum effects.
Therefore lets see another example of such methods use. The quantum mechanics and chemistry methods allow now to model just small systems, but give the opportunity to model molecular biological system
with maximum accuracy.
Moreover, when medicine development also needs various methods to model the exodus of pre-clinical
tests. For example, metabolism modelling, adsorption modeling, toxicity (ADME/Tox) modeling. Such kind
of methods are most effective when they achieve chemical compounds in correct operation with large
spaces.They should be able to reach hundreds of billions connections in a single database.
The personalized medicine methods development is example of using the project in bioinformatics.
To fulfil such kind of tasks we need to process the huge amount of data for each patient - genomic data
(genome is the collection of all patient’s genes), proteomic data (proteome is set of all human proteins),
transcript data (transcript is full RNA-set), as well as study of their combination and creating dynamic

7

metabolism models for any human pathology. Nowadays, there are huge efforts to create interactive models of organs and whole the human organism. These models are supposed to model the complex direct
impact on the biological targets’ set. Selection of such targets and combinations for medicines should be
maximally individualized to reach the greatest effectiveness of therapy and to minimize any side effects.

1.2.2. Site hosting
The SONM network can be used to host websites without depending on centralized cloud services (AWS / Azure / Google Cloud etc) or hosting providers. We use Cocaine open source PaaS
technology to implement virtual machines recognized as servers, with IPFS and other decentralized data storage solutions as an underlying layer.
Website owners can also use our code snippets on their websites to collect payments in SONM or Ether
tokens and automatically pay for hosting, according to market value.
It is important to look into TOR operation (The Onion Router). TOR uses pseudodomains .onion, domain
names look like this http://o3shuzjrnpzf2aiq.onion/
Domain names in the .onion domain are generated based on an open random key server and consist of 16
symbols. These websites are actually not websites at all, but are in fact so-called hidden services. SONM
is going to implement such services, of which one application could be hosting websites. Storage and
operation will be decentralized.
Realization will be in the form of free access to service data from the internet, or similar to the TOR system, limiting the access. The structure of the service depends directly on the application running in the
container.
In the address bar the service may look like name,site.sonm or probably just %name%.sonm (which would
be the name of the service that finds a hidden node using the locator and loads the website). This can be
used for additional identification of services on the SONM network and granting them additional properties.

1.2.3. Game server use-cases
There are lots of MMO games using in-game currencies. Our technology offers a solution for
deploying game servers in the SONM network. Furthermore, game currencies can be easily
exchanged for SONM tokens and back using our out-of-the-box solution.
In addition, gamers can support their favorite game servers by providing their computing resources in
exchange for tokens or in-game currency. In example, Quake dedicated server looks like a fully tuned and
setted up, ready-to-play, platform-independent docker container.

1.2.4. Neural networks projects
Machine learning algorithms, in particular neural networks, are a powerful technology that has
become more and more prevalent in the recent years; machine learning, powered by neural networks that emulate the work of the biological brain, is the true way in which computers can be
empowered to act like humans, and sometimes even transcend human abilities. Since the main
application areas of ML are sight and speech recognition, translation, prediction and data analysis, it is
not surprising that this technology is becoming part of many services. Projects on neural networks require
huge computing power for their deployment, training and tuning. The SONM system represents an economical and efficient solution for the implementation of machine learning algorithms and neural networks.
Designing the architecture of deep neural networks and the testing process in retrospect to solve the tasks
posed has a number of problems, some of which SONM is ready to solve.

8

Modern personal computers (for example, Core i5, 8Gb RAM) allow for a comfortable time to train neural
networks on samples within tens of thousands of examples, with the dimensions of input data up to several hundreds. Large samples are a task for these deep networks, which are taught on multiprocessor GPUs
for the implementation of convolutional and recurrent networks, various activation functions (semilinear,
sigmoidal, softmax) and an algorithm for back propagation of the error.
You can use SONM not just to speed up the learning process and improve the learning quality, but also to
guarantee quality of the working network, pre-learning the network or algorithm as a predetermined setting.
Using the SONM system you can speed up the algorithm treating processes for pre-computing of data
such as:
‑‑ task-independent - PCA, LDA, Kernel PCA
‑‑ picture treating - SIFT, SURF, CHoG, WAVELETS
‑‑ sound treating- DFT, FFT, MEL cepstra
‑‑ text treating - ITF-DF, N-grams

1.2.5. Rendering video and computer graphics
Rendering CGI can be distributed over the SONM network between a large number of computing
devices and can be processed very quickly (in a matter of minutes).
We provide much faster processing for Buyers’ (Clients’) CGI computing projects due to SONM’s
infrastructural flexibility. Compared to one K80 NVIDIA unit rental from Amazon (for example, for 10
hours), a buyer can use the SONM network to rent 600 K80 NVIDIA units with a total task processing time
of 10 minutes for each of them. It allows for use of more efficiently distributed architecture and parallel
computing.
Unlike cloud computing services, SONM can provide buyers any rental time, any computing architecture
and any computing network structure.

1.3. Cost-efficiency for the end-clients
Using the SONM platform will provide beneficial conditions due to a few important factors:
‑‑ Lowering the bandwidth costs
‑‑ Willingness of miners to use their hardware
‑‑ The market will be saturated with new sellers of computational power, which will facilitate a
drop in prices
‑‑ The lack of centralized servers which require additional infrastructure costs to maintain

2. SONM TECHNOLOGY
Nowadays the popular Internet of Things concept[2] (IoT) gives way to the new emerging concept called
Internet of Everything (IoE).
Internet of Everything is the unification of all computing resources of humanity. It has core differences
with currently widespread centralized cloud computing technology.
In order to develop a system implementing this disruptive idea, the SONM team used the most efficient
and proven P2P, distributed computing and blockchain technologies.
SONM is not a monolith product, it’s a top layer built on underlying protocols and technologies: Ethereum,
BTSync, Docker, Cocaine, etc.
(By the way, Bitcoin creator(s) also combined existing technologies (cryptography, P2P nodes network, git,
Proof-of-work concept, etc) to bring a brand new independent decentralized currency/payment system to
the world.)

2.1. IoE, IoT and fog computing
Before describing the future “World Computer” architecture we need to mention some details regarding
IoE, IoT and fog computing concepts.
Nowadays, the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) is commonly known.According to the IoT concept, Thing
is any natural or artificial object able to have an IP address and transfer data over the network.
Internet of Everything (IoE) represents further development of IoT concept: “Cisco defines the Internet
of Everything (IoE) as the networked connection of people, process, data, and things. The benefit of IoE
is derived from the compound impact of connecting people, process, data, and things, and the value this
increased connectedness creates as “everything” comes online.
IoE is creating unprecedented opportunities for organizations, individuals, communities, and countries to
realize dramatically greater value from networked connections among people, process, data, things[3].”
This definition emphasizes a very important aspect of IoE, which distinguishes IoE from IoT: namely, the
so-called “network effect”, formulated by James Macaulay from the Cisco IBSG consulting department.
The term “network effect” refers to a decentralization of organizations included in IoE.
These kinds of decentralized systems are being developed by groups of so-called “crypto-anarchists”
(people implementing decentralized P2P systems using cryptographic methods[4]). A way to implement
the IoT will be presented in the form of our own operating system, built on CoreOS implementing SONM’s
functionality. Any device can support such a system and when connected, can act as a computational unit
for the SONM fog.
Furthermore, in this document we are referring to decentralized organizations of computing machine resources, and not decentralized human organizations. Most of the data in the current IoT state of development is being processed by private centralized clouds - i.e. using cloud technologies, like AWS, Microsoft
Azure, etc.
Centralized cloud technologies have several weaknesses and can’t be used in IoE.
Some Things in IoE can create massive amounts of data. Cisco gives the example of the jet engine, which creates
about 10 Terabytes of its activity data in 30 minutes.
10

Transferring this data to the cloud, and receiving the results of data processing, requires adequate network
bandwidth, takes significant amounts of time and can have delays.
Furthermore, private centralized cloud systems potentially can be compromised, influenced from the outside, attacked or have failures, and also have lower computing power than fog computing solutions.

How can these problems be solved?
Fog Computing shifts the cloud computing paradigm and moves it to the lower level of the network.
Instead of processing some task using the cloud, we can use all the devices surrounding us: personal
computers, smartphones, even coffee makers and traffic lights.
Cisco’s Ginny Nichols originally coined the term Fog Computing. The metaphor comes from the fact that
fog is a cloud that is close to the ground, and thus fog computing concentrates processing at the edge
of the network. In Fog computing, data processing and applications are concentrated in devices at the
network edge rather than existing almost entirely in the cloud. That concentration means that data can be
processed locally in smart devices rather than being sent to the cloud for processing[5].
Thus, instead of centralized cloud solutions, we can use fog computing systems, getting the computational power of every internet-connected device, with decentralization advantages like independence from any
centralized service and full protection against possible failures, etc.

2.2. World Computer
The so-called “computing fog” is the layer of computational resources able to process some kind of task.
However, aside from computing fog, the system also involves its users setting computational tasks, and
some middleware distributing these tasks among the fog resources, which then returns the result of the
calculations.

This system is called “World Computer”.
The first mention of the World Computer term was in Vitalik Buterin’s project Ethereum. It is implemented
using blockchain technology’s ability to include executable code into transaction blocks, so every miner’s
machine automatically executes this code.
Thereby, Ethereum in fact is the World Computer working like a Turing Machine[6], with blockchain used as
a state register tape.
This also implies that due to the fact that every program must be run on every machine in the Ethereum
network, it is very costly and only a limited range of tasks can be run using this platform.
TURING MACHINE

11

There are other projects which are developing a decentralized world computer (Golem, iEx.Ec and others).
It is important to note that all of them are being implemented using the same principles as Ethereum. They
also have the same problem: excessive parallelization leading to high costs of operations. This is caused
by the absence of any control centers managing task processing in real time that can stop it after receiving the desired result. This in turn leads to running parallel/asynchronous processes.
In fact, these projects can’t provide the functionality which any usual personal computer has nowadays.
The SONM team has much experience developing a World Computer functional concept able to process
any task, up to the standard of a fully functional computer.

2.3. World Computer General Architecture / Infrastructure
The architecture of a single computer is the presence of standard components
such as CPU, Motherboard, BIOS, Bus, Hard Drive, GPU, RAM memory, etc For our
world computer architecture, we decided to follow the modular way all the personal computers are built.

World computer in the scheme has similar elements: CPU, BIOS, bus for data exchange, plugins board
(connectable devices), peripheral devices, graphics card, etc.
Hard disk drive analogue will be implemented using decentralized data storage solutions: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), Storj, Sia, etc.
The first component of the system is the processor.

13

SONM world computer’s processor is represented by the set of independent hub nodes distributing tasks,
assembling calculations results, keeping statistics and providing uninterrupted operation of the system.
Each hub node on the figure is equivalent to the processor’s core (but is not equivalent to the processor).
There can be an unlimited number of hubs, and they can be easily included and excluded from the system.
Hubs do not process calculations directly, but rather they represent a very important part of the system,
providing management and support (just like a computer’s processor regulates and controls the operation
of GPU, and is able to process sophisticated high-loaded parallel computations).
Hubs are implemented using Cocaine ‘gateway nodes’.
The next element of the system is equivalent to a PC’s GPU. It is comprised of fog computing miners’ processing tasks computations in the SONM system.
The communication bus for transferring data and messages in the network is represented by P2P101
Whisper modified in FUSRODAH communications module protocol of messaging between Sender (Node)
and Watcher (worker) machines will be implemented
msg := whisper.NewMessage / whisper.Watch
https://github.com/sonm-io/Fusrodah
Buyers are equivalent to PC peripheral devices, usually used for information input.
The plugins board allows the system to constantly expand and gain power by connecting to external compatible networks, for example, any Grid network.
BIOS is an important part of the SONM system, represented by an Ethereum blockchain in our decentralized computer model. As we mentioned earlier, Ethereum systems offer high reliability, but perform only
basic operations due to its architecture - this is why Ethereum is the most suitable candidate for the world
computer BIOS.
Finally, as we know, PC itself is not worth anything without an operating system. Our global computer also
requires an OS, and we have it ready.

2.4. World computer’s Infrastructure as a service
(WC IaaS)
In the previous section we looked at the overall architecture of the system.
The infrastructure part of the system is handled by a messaging framework and a smart contract system
(Blockchain government)

2.4.1. Slave Messaging Framework
Currently, the messaging framework is represented by the Slave messaging protocol. (https://github.com/
cocaine/cocaine-core/wiki/protocol)

14

2.4.2. Slave API
Common types
Object

::= <Number> | <String> | <Tuple> | <Map>

Tuple

::= ([<Object> [, <Object>]...])

General format
Every message is a MessagePack-ed tuple of three fields:
ChannelID
MessageID
Message

::= <Number>
::= <Number>
::= (<ChannelID>, <MessageID>, <Tuple>)

Message ID is a service slot number you’re going to call. Every service has its own set of slots which can
be inspected by resolving this service via the Locator. Channel ID is a way to multiplex multiple data flows
inside a single TCP session. Channel ID is generated by the caller. Tuple is a slot-specific payload.
The usage of Slave will be covered more thoroughly in coming versions.

2.4.3. The smart contract system
The set of protocols described in this section is one of the main contributions of our project. The goal of
those protocols is to glue the whole system together and enable trustless but secure interaction of the
participants.
We understand that even small flaws in the protocol design may have negative impact on the system integrity, so we decided to invest resources to formally specify and analyze possible participant interactions.
We use applied pi-calculus [7] for high-level but rigorous protocol description. The specification is still work
in progress and we consider integrating automated game-theoretic analysis later.
The pi-calculus is a minimal language for describing systems of processes that communicate on named
channels, with facilities for dynamic creation of new channels. We use it here without defining it formally,
you may refer to [8] for more information.

2.4.3.1. Blockchain government
Blockchain government is an organization (speaking metaphorically) consisting of a court, a DAO, a registry, a factory of enterprises (and an example of said enterprise).
The point of a blockchain government is to provide a simultaneous work process for all enterprises registered in such a system, motivating them to pay “taxes” to the DAO of a higher order, receiving court protection for their enterprise in exchange, as well as protection against unfair partners in the market. SONM
uses the following scheme for smart contracts to realize the pattern of a “blockchain government”:

Abstract

Simple Data flow
HUB
Before the hub starts paying out tokens to miners and receiving payments from buyers, it must create a
hub wallet — a simple contract with a fixed amount of frozen funds. If hub is caught on cheating, DAO can
initiate the process of blacklisting this hub and expropriate its frozen funds.
Those expropriated funds will also be frozen at the DAO account for some specified time. This is to protect
against malicious decisions of the DAO: tokens can drop in price during freeze, therefore there is no motivation to ‘raskulachivat’ (expropriate) every hub

16

SNM := !( *({approve, addr_from, addr_to, val}). _
| *({transfer, addr, val}) . _
)
DAO := *
Hub(wallet) := wallet<{deposit}>.
( Buyer({x : SNM}) . _
| _ . Miner<{x : SNM}> . Hub(wallet)
| DAO(x) . if x == STOP then wallet<{withdraw, val}>. DAO<{freeze, val}>. ()
)
| wallet<{setup}>. ν(ip) . !HubPool<{set, wallet_addr, ip}>. _ . Hub(wallet)

HUB FACTORY
Hub wallet can be created only by a Hub wallet factory (which is actually a simplified replication factory),
which creates a new hub wallet contract and registers it in the ‘whitelist’ contract.
HubFactory := ν(hubWallet). Whitelist<register hubWallet>. (Hub(hubWallet) | HubFactory)
WHITELIST
Whitelist contract is a registry contract containing info about hubs and their statuses. All hub wallets created by hub wallet factory are registered in this contract. It is supposed to be simple registry with a special
mapping for ‘trusted’ hubs. Initially, ‘trusted’ hubs will be checked by SONM developers manually / official
SONM hubs. Later, it’s supposed to be also a rating list — everyone could check the hub and rate it (betting
some amount of SONM tokens to prevent rating fraud).
WhiteList := HubWallet({eth_addr, deposit})
. ν(hub). ( HubFactory<{register, hub}> . _
		
| DAO({deregister, hub}) . _
		
| HubWallet({freeze}). _
		)

REGAPP
As REGAPP we use the React.js application which is simple web application (web-page) with the purpose
of user friendly hub registration process.
PAYOUT APP
Payout App is an application to process miners’ token payout mechanism operations. For now it is implemented to work with the BOINC statistic mechanism.

2.4.3.2. Example of usage of a ‘hub-wallet’ contract
Abstract
Before hub starts paying out tokens to miners and receiving payments from buyers – it must create a hub
wallet – a simple contract with a defined amount of frozen funds. If hub will be cheating – DAO could initiate process of blacklisting this hub and expropriate frozen funds from it.

17

Those expropriated funds will also be frozen at the DAO account for some specified time. This is to protect
against malicious decisions of the DAO: tokens can drop in price during the freeze. Therefore, there is no
motivation to expropriate every hub.

The contract exists in 4 states - Created, Registered, Idle, Suspected (+Punished)
When the contract is created, the constructor function designates the addresses of the DAO, the factory,
the whitelist, the wallet owner and a few other variables, such as the length of the payout period (which is
currently set at 30 days). The payout period is a period of time during which the hub can conduct payouts
to miners, but cannot take the entire balance for itself.
In the Created state the contract can be registered on the whitelist, freezing a set amount on its balance
(1 SONM token). This is designed to circumvent a situation like this – the hub first deposits 0.00000001
SNM, registers the contract, and then deposits the main sum of 100 SNM – the first amount is fixed. Furthermore, the time of registration is recorded when the contract is registered in the whitelist.
After the contract has been registered in the whitelist, it becomes Registered, in which state it has access
to the transfer, payday, suspect functions. Let’s take a closer look at them in order.
Transfer function
This function enables the contract to conduct payouts to the hub miners. It works as follows: first a lock
Fee - is designated, a percentage of the payout which will be locked for the payout period. The default value of it is 30%. Then a limit is set (the total amount of frozen funds + the frozen amount from the registration + the percentage for this particular transaction) and the balance is checked – if the balance is below
the limit, this particular transaction is not conducted, if everything is in order – the frozen percentage is
added to the total amount of frozen funds and the contract invokes the Approve function (details below)
towards the miner. The explanation of why the process is done this way is given in the PayDay portion of
the description.
Approve function
This function does not move the tokens to the miner’s wallet, but permits the miner to conduct this transaction on his one. This prevents the hub from registering a wallet in the system while conducting the
payouts through a separate wallet because the miner is waiting for approval from this particular wallet.
Approve is a standard function. (standard ERC20).
PayDay function
This function sets the contract state from Registered to Idle. This function checks the registration time
against the current date and thus can be invoked only at the end of the payout period. If this condition is
met, it transfers 0.5% of the frozen funds to the DAO wallet, after which it unlocks all the frozen funds and
sets the contract’s state to idle. In this idle state the contract can move all the funds back to the owner’s
wallet or register the contract again in the whitelist. During the idle state the hub cannot conduct payouts
or be dismantled.
Thus, if the owner can move the funds from the hub to his personal wallet he can do so in two ways – do it
in accordance with the rules, wait until the end of the payout period, pay the DAO 0.5% of the frozen funds
and move the rest to his wallet; or he can cheat and move all the funds using the transfer function under
the guise of paying miners, but in this case 30% of all funds will stay frozen +1 SNM. Such a system motivates the hub to act in compliance with the rules.

18

The contract also has the Suspected and Punished conditions. In the Registered state – the state when the
contract can be registered in the whitelist – the DAO and only DAO can invoke the suspect function, thus
setting the contract’s stats to suspected – suspected of being malicious. This function blocks all funds on
the contract’s wallet for 120 days.
In the suspected state the following functions can be invoked by the DAO exclusively:
Rehab function
This rehabilitates the hub, removes all fund freezes and set the contract state to idle. Can be invoked at
any time.
Ban function
This can only be invoked by the DAO committee after 120 days have passed since the contract’s state has
been set to suspected. Then all frozen funds of the contracts get sent to the DAO wallet, in which the contract state is set to punished, and the owner of the contract is blocked from conducting further operations
using this wallet.

2.4.4. SONM Miner-Hub interaction solution
Let’s consider the process of SONM miners and hubs communicating when they need to establish mutual
cooperation (i.e., the first phase, when the miner hasn’t decided yet whether to participate in computations
and receive tasks from the hub or not).
First, SONM hub administrator sets up an Ethereum smart contract containing SONM tokens used to pay
miners for computations.
Then, the ethereum address of this smart contract, address of pool administrator and hub IP are recorded
on a special SONM smart contract “Hubs Pool List”.
Hubs pool list includes unconfirmed (unverified) hubs and verified hubs (i.e., listed in the hubs whitelist).
The whitelist will be managed by members in the Decentralized Autonomous Organization. In any case,
hub information in SONM smart contracts includes the address of the hub owner, the address of the hub
wallet and the hub IP. In case of IP or wallet address change, the hub owner can change the hub record.
Therefore, SONM hub records the address of smart contracts containing the funds used to pay miners for
computations (so miners can check the existence of these funds) and registers basic information about
itself, including the address of the owner and IP.

19

Then, SONM hub agent starts broadcasting to the network using P2P messenger protocol, sending a
broadcast message about itself in the format: «IP, hub owner address, wallet address, hub name».
The agent on the miner’s side listens to the channel, receives data messages from the hubs, and then
makes a request to the Hubs Pool List smart contract to compare the data from the hub messages with
data in hubs whitelist. The miner may customize agent settings to accept messages from all servers or
only from proven ones listed in the Hubs Pool List.
After that, miner’s blockchain agent requests information about the contract-wallet of the hub, amount of
funds in the hub’s wallet and recent transactions of the wallet.
An intelligent agent checks the received data to compare it with conditions set by the miner. Are there sufficient funds in the hub wallet? Are hub payments to miners regular? What is the average amount of tokens
paid to miners by this hub?
Then, P2P messenger agent send a direct message to the hub to request additional meta-data, and records full information about the hub in its hubs list with a “not confirmed” mark.

At the same time, the P2P messenger agent constantly broadcasts question messages to the common
miners’ data channel for information about the hub, the average amount of reward paid to them, and so on.
Other miners’ agents broadcast positive answer messages to the channel if hub information in the question message is correlated with their information, or negative answers, if they believe this hub is malicious
or not reliable.
If a miner’s agent receives a sufficient amount of confirmations from the network, the hub receives
“checked” status in the miners’ hubs list. If the transaction received by the miner from this hub corresponds to the original agreement, the status of this hub changes to “safe”.
After that, depending on the settings of miner’s software, a miner can either manually select a hub to connect and perform computing tasks, or a miner’s agent can automatically select a hub offering maximum
profit and connect to it.
Then, P2P messenger agent send a direct message to the hub to request additional meta-data, and records full information about the hub in its hubs list with a “not confirmed” mark.
At the same time, the P2P messenger agent constantly broadcasts question messages to the common
miners’ data channel for information about the hub, the average amount of reward paid to them, and so on.
Other miners’ agents broadcast positive answer messages to the channel if hub information in the question message is correlated with their information, or negative answers, if they believe this hub is malicious

After that, depending on the settings of miner’s software, a miner can either manually select a hub to connect and perform computing tasks, or a miner’s agent can automatically select a hub offering maximum
profit and connect to it.

2.4.5. SONM Client-Hub interaction solution
Clients’ (buyer’s) interaction with SONM hubs is similar to the miner-hub agent’s interaction, with a difference in intellectual agent results’ parsing, which for buyers prefers the hubs with the lowest computations
price (and vice versa for miners). Buyers will most likely use the “Application Pool” (described in the section 2.8.3.), than “Hub Pool” smart contract.
Buyer creates a task and deposits funds to the hub’s smart contract wallet to pay for the job. When the
buyer receives the calculations result, he confirms the transfer of money using the smart contract;s function (similar to Multisignature Wallet).

2.4.6. SONM ‘Blockchain-government’ Expansion Policy
We previously looked at ways to implement the “blockchain-government” to work with the SONM system
using computational hubs as enterprises and miners as “workers”, but what if we go beyond the computational model and look that the current smart contract system in a broader sense?
What if we take a random business and try to apply it to the current system? Suppose you are an owner of
a restaurant – in which case you can similarly deploy a hub contract on the blockchain and register in the
whitelist, while carrying out your regular business transfers – receiving payments from clients and paying
your workers, but your bookkeeping will be relatively transparent for anyone, you will be under protection
by a DAO (a joint-share group of regular people which will resolve issues via voting),and your business will
be registered in the whitelist, similar to the governmental registry, giving your business a “Legitimacy certificate” of sorts and giving you a competitive advantage.
Creating the “blockchain-government” system is not the priority for SONM, but as you may recall, SONM is
an assembly. We suppose that those interested in the system described above will register on the SONM
whitelist, thus executing the expansion plan for the “blockchain-government” into other markets and implementations.

22

2.4.7. SONM Client-Hub content delivery method
Content delivery method is the only significant difference between client-hub and miner-hub interactions.
As you might expect, there is no difference between rendering a 6-hour video using the local computer and
uploading this video to the server while waiting for video rendering on the remote server, because most of
the time will be spent on uploading.
We developed a solution for this issue:
When a client wants to upload a large file of raw data to the server, SONM automatically creates a torrent
and sends a message to the selected hub. This hub receives the message and creates a task sequence for
torrent downloading, computation work with downloaded file(s) and creation of a new torrent for calculation
results file.
After processing the calculations and creating a torrent for the resulting data, the hub sends a message to
the buyer, who only has to download the received file from the miners.
We expect this to be the most rapid solution of all those that exist at the moment.

2.5. SOSNA in a nutshell
As a platform for SONM we propose using SOSNA – Superglobal Operation System by/for Network Architecture.
(look at the scheme on the next page)

2.5.1. What is SOSNA
SOSNA is a global operating system
built on the nesting doll principle. It is
important to understand the structure
of SOSNA in order to internalize this
concept. Let’s go from the end-user application to outer-layer infrastructure.
SOSNA itself is a top layer envelope
that works with the Grid-core (BOINC,
Yandex.Cocaine/ Other grid-compatible PaaS) and the infrastructure of
SONM smart contracts

2.5.2. Applications and
containerization
When you are developing an application, you must make sure it’s
will function properly that for the
end-user. But if the end-user’s computer does not possess the same
amount of libraries as the one you

23

used during development, or they may not be up-to-date with vulnerabilities left, it may cause unexpected
results. Is there any way to force the program to run exactly as it was intended, and at the same time make
it run safely for the end-user? For this, there are containers.
Containers allow us to run * any * software inside a secure, isolated environment. By itself, such a container is a miniature virtual machine, packed with all the dependency libraries of your system - so the compatibility problem and dependencies are relatively resolved. In addition, such a system is isolated in relation to
the host system, so no one can cause harm to the miner’s computer.
(link to 2.8 safety and security)

2.5.3. Slaves & their services
Let’s move up one level. Miner’s Host in this architecture is a simple node, a worker. (In cloud architecture
such a system is called Slave or Minion). All applications performed inside containers are called services.
We will talk more thoroughly about what containers are in the SaaS chapter. The miner’s host itself can be
definitively represented as an assembly of services and a service location system.

Service
Service is an actor, an RPC-enabled piece of code, which accepts a certain set of messages. Technically speaking, each service dispatches a service protocol — that is, a list of methods and their respective
SlotIDs you can call by sending messages to the service just after a connection has been established. This
protocol description can be dynamically obtained (along with other stuff) by resolving a service name via
the locator.
The important part here is that, in line with the actor model, the client is an actor too. So, after you have
sent a message to a service to do something for you, it responds by sending messages as well. But
unlike server-side services with service-specific protocols, every client dispatches the streaming service
protocol, mostly for backward compatibility and ease of use.
Each connection between a client and a service is multiplexed using ChannelIDs, and both ends of a given
channel dispatch some specific, possibly different, protocols. For example, the usual session between a
client and a service goes as follows:
‑‑ A client connects to some service and picks any channel at random (for example, channel
#1), because all of them are not used in the beginning. Initially the service side of a channel
dispatches the service-specific protocol, and the client side dispatches the streaming protocol.
‑‑ The client sends a message tagged with the chosen ChannelID in order to call one of the service’s methods. That indicates the start of a session.
‑‑ he service switches its side of the channel to the null protocol, so that the client couldn’t call
some other method in the same channel while the service processes you request.
‑‑ The client starts to receive the streaming protocol Chunk messages with the service response.
‑‑ In the end, the service sends a Choke message to indicate that the session has been completed and switches its side of the channel back to the service-specific protocol.
‑‑ If that was the only request, the client disconnects
Note that some services provide streamable methods: in that case the service will switch to the streaming
protocol instead of the null protocol, so that you can stream some data to the service.

24

Locator
When a node starts, it reads its configuration file, which has a list of services to run. This list only specifies
service names and types, but not network-related properties, because the I/O layer and the RPC layer are
completely separate. Moreover, the services themselves have no code to communicate over the network,
only the message dispatching code.
In order to enable those services to receive and send messages over the network, the node starts a special
service called the locator. Every other service is attached to the locator, which in turn wraps them in an
event loop, binds them to some network endpoints and announces them in the cluster. The locator itself
always runs on a public port.
So, a client should perform the following steps to connect to the requested service:
‑‑ Connect to service locator on a public port.
‑‑ Send a Resolve message with the name of the required service using any channel.
‑‑ Receive a Chunk message with the information about the service endpoint, its protocol version and its dispatch maps (which is a mapping of message numbers to method names).
‑‑ Receive a Choke message indicating that the request has been completed.
‑‑ Connect to the specified endpoint and work with the requested service.
Services can stack protocols. For example, the Elliptics service implements both the generic storage protocol and its own specific protocol, which means that a client requesting storage service can be routed to the
Elliptics service instance. That is fine, because stacking allows the client to work with the Elliptics instance
without even knowing the service-specific protocol details — protocol messages have the same SlotIDs no
matter what service implements the given protocol and whether it uses protocol stacking or not.

2.5.4. Masters and Gateways
Let’s advance one layer higher. Here you can see that in addition to the miner machine itself, there is a
master machine, i.e. Hub, the approximate function of which we considered in the paragraph about IaaS.

Master
Master manages the execution of services on the machines of miners, maintains statistics, balances the
load, carries out the validation of results, leads the task planner, etc. - i.e. Behaves like a conventional cryptocurrency pool. Master is also called a Gateway node.

Gateway
Optionally, the locator can be configured to aggregate other locators’ multicast announcements (or use a
provided list of remote nodes) and act as a cluster entry point for clients. In other words, the aggregating
locator job is to configure a gateway by connecting with all the remote nodes and monitoring their health
and service updates.
Gateways are pluggable locator modules which provide remote location functionality. For example, a simple builtin Adhoc Gateway randomly picks a remote node for each client, and IPVS Gateway operates on a
kernel IPVS load balancer to set up a local virtual service for each available service in the cluster.
Clients can use these aggregating locators to access every service in the cluster regardless of their physical location in a load-balanced fashion.

25

2.5.5. Grid - Core
Two machines - Master & Worker form a basic implementation of the Grid standard - a loosely coupled
computing network. A key feature of the Grid standard is the prerequisite for decentralization and geographic remoteness of Masters from Workers. As an example, we consider the product https://github.
com/cocaine/cocaine-core as an example of Grid-Core.

2.5.6. Intercommunication Services
SOSNA intercommunication services are a common p2p message bus, with which miners, hubs and
clients communicate, as well as the Blockchain API service, which allows SOSNA to communicate with
Blockchain.

2.6. World Computer SaaS and its API
Example of the simple application that can be run on SOSNA
#!/usr/bin/env python
from cocaine.services import Service
from cocaine.worker import Worker
storage = Service(“storage”)
def process(value):
return len(value)
def handle(request, response):
key = yield request.read()
value = yield storage.read(“collection”, key)

response.write(process(value))
response.close()
Worker().run({
‘calculate_length’: handle
})

2.7. Results verification
The problem of validating computations executed by a third party is a thoroughly researched topic [9] [10], but
it still lacks production-ready solutions, since most of them are very expensive in practice (at least in an
HPC setting).
More practical solutions are based on repeating computations – verification by replication. This approach
requires designated nodes (hubs) to distribute work units, aggregate results and verify them. Docker uses
this approach and has a highly tested implementation.
For certain kinds of computational problems it may be practical to offload the task of aggregation and
verification to a smart contract. The process goes as follows: miner computes some work unit and posts

26

merkle-tree root hash to the smart contract. Some other miner computes the same work unit and notices that results differ. In this case, it is possible to calculate a compact proof of cheat. The proof can be
checked by the smart contract, and the cheater punished.
Economic motivation is used to promote this double-checking behavior: miners deposit some fixed
amount of tokens, and this deposit will be returned after some timeout if no proof of cheat was posted. On
the other hand, it is possible to earn tokens by checking computations and revealing cheaters.

Verification by smart contracts is actively researched [11][12] and has some benefits:
‑‑ does not require trusted third party to aggregate and verify results
‑‑ does not impose any overhead in case of honest miners
‑‑ has limited and bearable overhead in case of dishonest miners

Notes:
We will have a fully functional system that will be used for any general-purpose computations, starting
from the v.2.0. It is most likely that by this stage the SONM platform will have full-scale computational
projects deployed with high turnover volume. (link to chapter 3. Roadmap)
Moreover, by the v.2.0 we expect SONM to attract lots of open-source community members, which means:
‑‑ The community will be independently creating lots of decentralized grid-compatible apps.
‑‑ Lots of brand new markets and teams are potentially going to appear, as well as numerous
community-crafted tools for interaction with the SONM platform, most likely better than the
original apps, developed by the SONM team. For example, the official geth Ethereum client
made by Ethereum Foundation comparing to Parity by EthCore, or Windows Media Player
compared to WinAmp or Internet Explorer comparing to Mozilla Firefox. We understand and
welcome it
That means that starting from this point we will need to reduce our efforts for tools development and give
way to the free market and community.
We will focus on creating new formations for interaction with this market:
‑‑ a dedicated team developing decentralized computational power exchange
‑‑ teams providing server hosting services based on the SONM platform
‑‑ software for niche markets
‑‑ various integration projects
‑‑ external formations for tools development (like Metamask.io by ConsenSys)
I.e., by this point we will have a distinct division of SONM development areas. For example:
‑‑ original SONM core developers are creating basic protocols of the system
‑‑ another team is creating apps within smart-solutions
‑‑ SONM ExChange team is building UI-friendly tools for the interaction with buyers and managing the decentralized exchange

2.8. Safety and Security
In this chapter, we look at security aspects for miners and buyers

2.8.1. Safety for miners
Safety from hostile workloads. Docker isolation.
One of the docker’s software packages is a daemon - which consists of a container server,launched via the
“docker -d” command), client tools which permit the user to control the modus and containers directly via
the command line interface and an API which permits the user to control the containers via a REST-style
program.

28

The daemon provides a complete isolation for the containers launched on the node at the file system level
(each container has his own root), at the process level (the processes have access permission only for the
container’s own file system and the resources are split up using libcontainer), at the network level (each
container has access exclusively to the range of network names tied directly to it and the corresponding
network interfaces).
Safety for “reputation” and pirates.
How miner can secure himself from payloads, which don’t harm his computer, but have the reputational
risk possibility? There can be website from darknet, bot-machine, credit card hacker or porn on his computer, so how our system provides security against such sort of thing?
We use the special ‘Whitelist’ contract for that, which is part of the Anti-Fraud system, where each hub and
miner is registered and each of them, who is registered in whitelist, can be blocked and kicked out from
the system by DAO voting. The pirate contracts of hubs and miners’ wallets, which are not registered in the
whitelist, will not be visible from the general settings, so they won’t be affected by DAO voting. Therefore,
hubs will have to offer to host only such kind of services that meet the community reputational requirements, which are formed by the community itself. It is also obliviously that one can configure the miner client program to accept the proposals from the pirate hubs, but then there are no any guarantees of security
and fair payment.

2.8.2. Dishonest nodes eliminate
The contract also has the Suspected and Punished conditions. In the Registered state – the state when
the contract can be registered in the whitelist – the DAO and only DAO can invoke the suspect function,
thus setting the contract’s stats to suspected – suspected of being malicious. This function blocks all
funds on the contract’s wallet for 120 days. In the suspected state the following functions can be invoked
by the DAO exclusively:
This mean that the only way to hub to get all his money including lockedFunds - is to invoke this function
and pay DAO 0.5% of lockedFunds. In any other case 30% from all hub’s operation’s will be locked on the
contract balance.
Suspected - Gulag function
This can only be invoked by the DAO committee after 120 days have passed since the contract’s state has
been set to suspected, then all frozen funds of the contracts get sent to the DAO wallet, the contract state
is definitively set to punished , and the owner of the contract is blocked from conduction further operations
using this wallet.

2.8.3. Safety for buyers
How is ensured to honest buyers their task is being run for given time?
The first method is by query metrics. Hub should understand how much resourses are consumed by one
instance of task, depending on the number (for example) of the input connections. Therefore, Hub can estimate the one connection value and then estimate work by its number. Of course, it gives just an approximate result and works only with stateless tasks, where users don’t transfer the complete data volume into
application (or we know in advance the approximate data volume). I.e. relatively talking, it will work for the
casual websites and applications, but, for example, for such kind of service as photo and video editing
client - > buyer(hub) -> miner
quieries ------> miner
hub <-----------metrics

29

The second method – by resources. We should make a request inside the platform or container to specify
how much resources were spent. However, there is a danger that miner can open everything on his computer and fake the data. In contrast to the number of requests that we can measure on our Hub machine,
this method is no longer reliable (although, more accurate).
The third method is reputational. We assume that networks will function both like “fog” public parts, i.e.
like clusters from multiple independent solo miners, and like private pools, i.e. private clouds (or probably
some informal unions of solo miners like, for example, cartels).
In this case client wants to choose, does he want to run the task in the multiple independent and difficult
to verify nodes, or in the private nodes (private hubs).
How is ensured to honest buyers their task is being run properly
We take container and put out the hash from it. If hash coincides with mastercopy on the hub side, we
decide that everything is good and it is our container. Hash is put out by the Docker engine and subscribed
by the platform private key, which is unique for each installation. Then, among other things, we also force
the Docker engine and platform key to update, so potential hacker will have to learn how to hack the whole
system very-very fast and, in fact, with such a security system there is zero possibility of any successful
hack.
In addition – PoS and reputation – every miner, who wants to earn more, must make a deposit on his wallet as a proof of “decency”, guarantee.
Also, it is possible to contact directly the launched container by ssh and check the ongoing process.

2.9. AI implementation
Artificial intelligence is implemented for three main tasks based on various properties and regularities of
algorithms and various formal models of their representation. First of all, it is worthwhile to focus on the
task that solves the “trust problem” in relation to specific hubs. Methods implementing artificial intelligence, namely, methods of computational AI, such as neural networks and methods of evolutionary computation are capable of contributing to the solution of this problem.
Based on the logging of the messaging channel and receiving certain information about the hubs and their
characteristics, an image of “natural selection” is created, at which the least optimal sets of characteristics
are eliminated according to the specified decision criterion. The program analyzes the rating system of the
hubs and their activity and creates a request to the blockchain to confirm. Only after an answer has been
received it gives consent (with the successful state of the channel and a high level of trust) to connect and
make a deal with this particular hub.
The neural network is based on the data filtering algorithm (takes into account OLS), uses a binary decision tree and clustering algorithms (used to extract information, compress data and examine data properties).
As a result, with the help of neural networks SONM analyzes and predicts the risks of transactions with
each particular hub and solves the trust problem.
As Goolge (ex DeepMind) team show in 2016, using of AI can significantly improve loading of data center
and got up to 40-60% reducing energy consumption in their datacenters . Going this way, to reduce costs
(thus get up profit) for miners, SONM, using wide number of advanced metrics from master (“Hubs”) and
slave (“Worker”) machines, aggregate this big data and train Hubs NN-based AIs to optimizing dispatching of data to Workers. We’ll train AIs to solve Combinatorial optimization problems [13], for example The
Knapsack[14] problem and the Travelling salesman problem [15]. These problems are NP-incomplete, so we
have a basic implementation of a weak-class AI.
30

The Knapsack problem is solved in the context of ‘miners briefcase’ - how to divide resources between different projects/hubs, with maximal profit and risk diversification. Put simply, it would be like “What coins
do I need to mine if btc goes down and in what proportion for each of it?”
The Travelling salesman problem is solved in the context of resource distribution and backs to GRID-network standards (this feature is not fully implemented yet).

2.10. SONM GitHub repositories
github.com/sonm-io

2.11. UI and API
2.11.1. Example of how the SONM marketplace works
Market mechanisms.
One must remember that the end-user rarely interacts with the market directly, the market is mainly used
by owners of hubs, miners or developers.

An overview of the marketplace from the viewpoint of the Buyer (Developer).
CLIENT-HUB POINT OF VIEW:
1. Hosting applications
This is represented by a standard market mechanism functioning as a cloud market: an aggregator, where
users can choose the cluster to host their applications. The cluster is chosen depending on the preferences of the client : region, pricing, power, etc. The system basically functions like the market.
This diagram represents a simple market mechanism, where a developer picks a cluster where the app will
be hosted (a few clusters can be chosen) .
2. Selling utility services
A developer, which has created a utility service, can sell it or delegate it to hubs, collecting passive income
via it. An example of such a service can be SUBD, a messenger service which is registered in the Application Pool and is offered to hubs. Hubs can be interested in using said application to attract more clients
and gain advantage over their market rivals, which leads to market growth. The developer can view the
service statistics in his personal account.

An overview of the marketplace from the viewpoint of the Worker (miner)
HUB-MINER POINT OF VIEW:
Miner, according to his preferences, automatically, according to set criteria, connects to the hub which
mays the most and has the most stable bandwidth. As such there is a market here as well – on one side
there is the computational power, on the other – money, but this market is almost entirely automated and
unnoticeable to the miner (the system was designed to let the miner simply press a button and not monitor
the rest of the process).

31

To summarize:
For the client everything is easy – his application will be run on the closest miner. This means that for the
end-user the difference will be virtually unnoticeable. The client/owner will be paying less, and the application will run faster.
On the technical level the application will first request the designated hub or the required amount of computational power (in order to contact the locator service) for service, and if such a service is available, the
application will request it to be performed on the closest machine available (which will accordingly be the
cheapest option).

2.11.3. API for software developers
In the first stages developers’ API will be implemented using widespread and well-tested Yandex, Cocaine
and Ethereum API.
In the further stages of platform development, after the system core upgrade to v.2.0, we’ll create proprietary SONM API.Top-level api, which defines the logical grouping of containers, which allows you to define
container pools, distribute the load, and also specify their placement.

v.0.1 - ANGE (Current Version)

Ӕ

Yandex. Cocaine as a platform, Docker as an isolation.
Supported languages:
‑‑ C++
‑‑ Go
‑‑ Java
‑‑ Node.js
‑‑ Python
‑‑ Ruby
‑‑ [In development] Racket
We have the following services:
‑‑ Logging
‑‑

Node-local file storage

‑‑ MongoDB storage
‑‑ Elliptics storage
‑‑ Node-local in-memory cache
‑‑ Distributed in-memory cache
‑‑ URL Fetch
‑‑ Jabber
‑‑ [In development] Notifications
‑‑ [In development] Distributed time service
Prototypes of the smart-contracts system (“Forge”), Slave protocol for communication between nodes.
Anyone can create his own hub and try to collect powers from miners, or create his own
cluster (from many owned machines). Anyone could run any usual docker container on it or
create your own application in Cocaine framework (see sections above or github).
v.0.2 - PRINCIP (june 2017)
Main Token Contract and ICO application. Payout prototype (already implemented for
BOINC-platform “DrugDiscovery@home”)

ꟼP

Optimized To>man - Yandex.Cocaine - based platform for fog computing will be implemented.
Ethereum P2P101 Whisper modified in FUSRODAH - based protocol of messaging between
Sender (Node) and Watcher (worker) machines will be implemented.
As a demonstration of universality of platform, QUAKE game server container will be implemented .)

34

v.0.3 - ARCH (september 2017)
On this version we will focus on the most crucial parts of the system. For now the slave
protocol is literally ‘protocol’ - it has no own libraries or API, it’s just an agreement inside the
module system.

AꞪ

On the platform level it is will be PayOut dapp - a simple dapp which allow hub administrator
payout tokens to miners, depending on their work - it is already done for BOINC-like platforms
such as“DrugDiscovery@home”. We need to simply adapt it to our newly deployed token contract and architecture of the Cocaine gateway node.
On the smart contracts level it will work with our DAO contract.
+Browser for sites
+Messages optimization (channels,anti-flood etc)
+DAO & Dividents payout
+ UI and UX improvments for all sides.
+General productivity improvments
Browser for sites means we will have our own browser for our services and sites (inside
sonm network). Probably it would be web3 compatible (metamask in complect) - It’s also will
be good test for locator services - network should spawn apps and sites nearby with browser
user (cookie definition and e.t.c.).
v.0.4 - POWER (march 2018)
In this version we will be adding new messaging types for new messaging systems, tuning
the communication between miners and hubs. We will probably rewrite the internal DNS peer
discovery service as well (it allows the searching of peers during listening of the general
channel in the messaging system).

PR

Concerning the core platform we will work towards business logic (market and AI) implementation, and tuning in messages and blockchain API.
On the platform level we will be implementing integration with DCFS like IPFS,Swarm, Storj.
Application registry. On the smart-contracts level we will be finishing work on “Factory”.
v.0.5 - VIRT (june 2018)
Application registry means some ‘trusted’ registry of approved applications. If miner or hub
will want use applications not from this registry (e.g. using their own private registry or other
sources like github or private dev repositories) - they should add new source manually etc.

VT

Court app - is application which filter DAO proposal and parsing messages channel to structurise flow of ‘blaming’ proposal and let community better tool to look at it. And vote for it.
On this level all the newest contracts from “Factory” - Whitelist, HubFactory,HubWallet will be
deployed. It will be the start of forming real new homeostasis of the system. After that we
think that a few “debug” releases will be necessary with different community proposals.
+General locator and end-node client

35

This mean that locator will be used not only for browser, but for any type of application. We
think it will take all queries from localhost to the network services and look for this services
in sonm network to determine nearest good point.
+BTSync
+Court app
v.1.0 - DOMIN (august 2018)

DM

The very first commercial version of this platform for public usage.
Global DNS and service locator improvements allow us to create a new internet browser,
which would allow everyone to find and run services like https://servicename.
Graphic UI improvements for each part of the system permit us to improve the user experience and start to widely expand among ‘non-bitcoiners’.
We also believe that other companies will use our smart-contract’s organization (Forge), which
would allow them to use one contract-register and fair system protection from malicious users
and fraud.
v.1.1 - THRON (november 2018)

TN

UX improvement, community proposals, feedback, debug, etc.
v1.n - CHERUB (2019)
Development of the new SOSNA version is started, which will be based on CoreOS (a system you could literally run everywhere - microwaves and washing machines). Seriously, read
about CoreOS - it is awesome!

CB

v.2.0 - SERA (2020)
Release of SOSNA 2.0. Imagine if your smart-watches from Apple could earn you money?
That’s what we are talking about - When “Time is money!” is not just words.

SA

Notes:
We will have a fully functional system, able to be used for any general-purpose computations, starting from
the v.1.0. Most likely, by this stage SONM platform will have full-scale computational projects deployed
with high turnover volume.
Moreover, by the v.1.0 we expect SONM to attract lots of the open-source community members, which
means:
‑‑ The community will be independently creating lots of decentralized grid-compatible apps.
‑‑ Lots of brand new markets and teams are potentially going to appear, as well as lots of community-crafted tools for interaction with the SONM platform, most likely better than the original apps, developed by the SONM team. For example, the official geth Ethereum client made
by Ethereum Foundation comparing to Parity by EthCore, or Windows Media Player compared
to WinAmp or Internet Explorer comparing to Mozilla Firefox. We understand and welcome it.

36

That means that starting from this point we’ll need to reduce our efforts for tools development and give
way to the free market and community..
We’ll focus on creating new formations for interaction with this market:
‑‑ a dedicated team developing decentralized computational power exchange
‑‑ teams providing server hosting services based on the SONM platform
‑‑ software for niche markets
‑‑ various integration projects
‑‑ external formations for tools development (like Metamask.io by ConsenSys)
I.e., by this point we will have a distinct division of SONM development areas. For example:
‑‑ original SONM core developers are creating basic protocols of the system
‑‑ another team is creating apps within smart-solutions
‑‑ SONM ExChange team is building UI-friendly tools for the interaction with buyers and managing the decentralized exchange

3.2. Dissemination of the development process
information
‑‑ The project team is responsible for making the results open to the public and for using all
available resources to disseminate information about the project.
‑‑ We will publish a report about current development results and issues at least once a week.
‑‑ Report will contain current project needs and issues.
‑‑ All major breakthroughs will be communicated with interested mass media and spread in
major community forums like BitcoinTalk and CryptoCoin Talk.

1. Platform
Grid is a formal technology/a standard of geographically dispersed computational networks.
Let’s take a look at how these three projects design their platforms.
Golem are creating their own platform for computations, in our opinion this is similar to reinventing the
wheel and has no obvious merit. There’s no clear understanding of what basis for the technology are they
using (GRID or Cloud), no logical justification for using Python as their main programming language (Python is web-oriented, creating a platform requires more appropriate language, like C++ or Java).
iEX, on the other hand, is based on Xtremweb-hep. The Xtremweb-hep platform is based on the GRID technology and written using Java.
38

Finally, SONM uses and is going to improve the Yandex.Cocaine platform. Yandex.Cocaine is based on a
Distributed Cloud structure (unlike the regular Cloud structure,there is no hard master-minion assignment,
like the one used in Kubernetes by Google). It is written using C++, has implementations for Go, Java and
Haskell, among others. Our programmer Max Taldykin was part of the team designing the Haskell implementation.
What can be considered the best solution for a world computer platform?
A hybrid technology must be created and used, Grid+Cloud.
Golem cannot provide a competing solution at this moment, their own projects are far behind the most
innovative ideas. Their popularity is largely driven by the fact that they were the first ones to showcase the
distributed world computer structure, and now the only way forward left for them is to start working on
restructuring their work algorithms and integrating new technologies.
iEX has a few very good solutions presented on the technical level using the Grid technology, but most Grid
solutions are based on scientific calculation needs and have poor compatibility with traditional clouds.
They also lack locator services and many more. Another disadvantage of their technologies would be the
need to work in the direction of the Cloud technology ( developing system messages, metrics, accounization, billing, services).
SONM is based on the Distributed Cloud technology and has all the necessary resources to create the
proper platform. We are planning to adopt a few technological distinctions of the Grid system – integrating
an additional validation system ( it is already being prepared and in soon we will present a unique system
of undetermined computation verification). There are no similar projects developed and copying it will be
very difficult for competitors. Further development of existing containers with the intention of unifying
processes computed by the miners is also planned.

2. Anti-fraud protection
One of the most important aspects involved in the effective implementation of distributed computing is
anti-fraud protection.
SONM has a working prototype of a unique anti-fraud protection system based on smart contracts. This
will provide miners and customers solid protection from malicious nodes, clusters and pools within the
system. This system is also a key to us upscaling, since this system can be used as a separate product.
You can find more information about the smart contract system here:
https://github.com/sonm-io/Contracts-scheme
Please also check here:
https://github.com/sonm-io/Factory/blob/master/contracts/Hubs/README.md

3. Container
The isolation system used as a core for computing by SONM, iEx and Golem is Docker. All development
teams agree that this is the most up-to-date and useful solution.

4. P2P architecture
By using a hybrid P2P architecture, we can create computing pools out of the main number of miners/clients (similar to the cryptocurrency pools).Golem,while using full P2p, does not support the implementation
of this case.

39

The specifics of SONM implementation.
The architecture has a ‘hub’ which can serve as a regular client node (the client adds a number of tasks to
the hub, which he created, and gives those to the miners), but also as gateway node, which can assemble
mining power and perform tasks sent in by clients. That way the client doesn’t need to implement his own
node and fine-tune it to connect to the services. The services themselves will be discussed in detail in a
further article.

5. SaaS
Software-As-A-Service implementation is the weak point of all grid systems. A large share of the cloud
computing market is providing SaaS services (hosting websites, mobile apps, mail services, messengers,
etc.). Currently SaaS is implemented and working in SONM, while Golem is planning to implement it in a year.
With regards TOR operations (The Onion Router), TOR uses pseudodomains.onion, and domain names
look like the following: http://o3shuzjrnpzf2aiq.onion/
Domain names in the .onion domain are generated based on an open random key server and consist of
16 symbols. These websites are actually not websites at all, as they are in fact so-called hidden services.
SONM is going to implement such services in the future, of which one application could be hosting websites. It is vital to take into account that storage and operation will be decentralized.
The realization will be in the form of free access to service data from the internet, or a process which is
similar to the TOR system, which limits access. The structure of the service depends directly on the application running in the container.
In the address bar the service may look like the following: name,site.sonm or simply just %name%.sonm
(which would be the name of the service that finds a hidden node using the locator and loads the website).
This can be used for additional identification of services in the SONM network, granting them additional
properties.

6. Fog computations
Cocaine has an integrated locator service, which allows the system to identify the service accessibility
within the cluster. With a little fine-tuning our system can work as a true fog computing system – when
a client requests access to a certain service, the locator (or a specifically created additional global higher-layer locator) will identify the cluster closest to him and perform the computations using it, thereby
sufficiently reducing traffic.
Speaking about iEx and Golem, they have yet to mention the implementation of this service.

To summarize:
It is currently hard to describe Golem as a serious project. We call the current state of affairs reinventing the
wheel. therefore, only a serious change in the direction of their work can permit them to stay in the field.
SONM, on the other hand, is using the Distributed Cloud technology as its base. The SONM team is modifying said technology to fit our current goals in producing a less work-intensive endeavor than combining
Xtermweb-hep (base used by iEx) with traditional Cloud services, due to Grid software being severely
limited in that regard, and developing it to commercial standards is very difficult and time-consuming.
This is the reason SONM decided not to use BOINC, which is one of the Grid software solutions, similar to
Xtremweb-hep.

40

Having a prototype system for verifying undetermined computations also gives a hefty advantage to
SONM.
Implementation time and flexibility in technologies used will be the deciding factor at the starting phase of
the project and will give us a continuous edge.
SONM is now looking to hire world-class specialists on P2P networks and locators (for optimization) and
people with experience working with BTSync and Tor Browser software.

Definition of words
Starbase:
The platform name; Starbase is both an open and closed source project. Starbase.Inc
will do technical consulting by providing a crowdfunding/sourcing platform which
enables you to issue conditional tokens from templates.
Starbase Token:
The token which is issued by the Starbase team, and which has consumable,
rewardable, inflationary features.

STAR:
Currency symbol of Starbase token. Starbase token detail is described in the following
section.
Token:
Token is a frequently used term in the blockchain industry for data which has some
value. We will use ERC20 type tokens, which are the most widely adopted type of
tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
Core team:
People who are going to provide or who are currently providing some service or
product.
Possible core teams are listed below:
- Global and innovative non-blockchain based projects
Such as bio-technology ventures in France, an encrypted chat application platform
in Russia, Fintech company in Israel, and those who need rapid, global growth with
a lot of supporters.
-

Startups, New business planners in big companies
A lot of companies and projects which don’t know anything about the blockchain
technology can join the Starbase platform as a decentralized fundraising or human
resource management solution.
Decentralized crowdfunding and human resource management provide a cheap,
fast, and global way to communicate with your team member and expand your
team around the world.

-

Artists/Athletes/Talents
Hidden talents can use the crypto crowdfunding system. They can issue the tokens
and sell them. After they become famous or acquire revenue, they can
automatically return to the service by attaching some rights to the token. For
example a talent can sell his own token which has consumable features and token
holders can receive 1 hour of service from the talent by consuming the token.

-

Event organizer
Event tickets can also be represented by tokens, and sold online. For example, if
you have 1 event token, you can join the event and you will receive part of the
event’s revenue.

Supporter:
Supporters are those who want to support projects by purchasing core team’s tokens
or by working on core team’s projects.
Possible Supporters are below:
-

Blockchain engineers, designers
Ethereum, Augur, SingularDTV, DigixDAO, GEMZ, Factom, and many other token
based projects are developed by blockchain savvy engineers and designers. They
understand the potential of a project since the development phase and can support
the Core team’s project by sharing the long-term incentive with the issued token.

-

Non-blockchain Engineers, designers
Even non-blockchain engineers and designers can cooperate in promising
blockchain projects and if they believe in the potential, they will end up supporting
core teams’ projects by using the issued tokens.

-

Blockchain Marketers
Some famous blockchain marketers, and blockchain-knowledged marketers know
how-to marketize your tokens. They will cooperate in the core team’s project by
accepting payment in the issued tokens.

-

Non-blockchain marketers
Even marketers without blockchain knowledge can join the movement and support
the core team’s project should they want to. They will be paid in issued tokens.

-

Blockchain legal specialists
This is fairly difficult part to conduct, but there are some blockchain-specialized

Page 3 of

lawyers and accountants in the world. They know how the legal framework
operates, and can help tremendously the core team’s project. They can also be paid
in issued tokens.
-

Non-blockchain legal specialists
It may take some time for non engineers, and non blockchain users to understand
the blockchain ecosystem, but legal specialists will understand the potential and
possibly support your project by accepting the issued tokens.

Milestone:
The Milestone is a term that is often used for crowdsourcing or engineering payment
systems.
Milestone payments are requested by supporters and set by core teams to guarantee
that the work payments will be paid after completing a certain milestone.
Work:
Starbase is a token based crowdsourcing platform. Core teams can post works and
supporters can do them for a payment in Bitcoin, Ether, or their issued tokens.
Generally this kind of job is not long term, but in duration of 1 week to 6 months.
For example, software development, translation, logo design, web/mobile design,
movie making, online consulting, financial advice, legal advice can be posted to
Starbase with the relevant payment information. Each job should have milestones and
for each reached milestone a payment can be sent in the issued tokens and Bitcoin,
Ethereum.
Crowdsale:
Crowdsale is used to refer to the sale of tokens on “Internet of Value” by using a
permissionless blockchain. It’s global and transparent process, which cannot be
modified neither by the token issuer or the Starbase admin.
Early Purchaser:
Before the public crowd sale, core teams often need to do marketing and demo
product development in order to prove their capability and get attention. In that case,
early purchase system can help core teams by selling their tokens.
Token sale:
Token sale is the generic name of early purchase + crowdsale.
ICO:
In blockchain world, there are a lot of definitions for the term ICO, but by our
definition, ICO is the time when the issued tokens become transferrable. By using

Starbase templates, just after the crowdsale phase, issued tokens are non-transferable.
After the core team releases the service or product, then the token will become
transferrable, and it can be traded on global crypto currency exchanges. This is what
we call “ICO”.
Smart contract:
Written programs which can be run on the blockchain.

Background:
Global projects, the “Internet of Value”.

Source:​http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-25/this-is-your-company-on-blockc
hain

Currently in the blockchain world a lot of projects are starting from crowd sales, or by
creating new cryptocurrencies to finance new projects.

New projects in the blockchain world are mostly based on global individuals. Financial
incentives and human resources are moving around between individuals quickly and
globally with cheap transaction fees.
In the case of Ethereum, roughly 500k people are holding Ether tokens, and they are
sharing the intense interest and incentive of the project.

Starbase’s Mission
Starbase’s mission is to make it easy for everyone to start or support projects which
aim to create new services and products.
Starbase provides a crowdfunding and crowdsourcing/recruiting platform which gives
long term incentive sharing mechanism on the “Internet of Value”.
The current incentive-shared team making solution for new project initiators is based
on traditional, local and slow stock based system. Therefore, it’s difficult for core teams
to recruit savvy members without a fair amount of initial capital. Even when core teams
want to share the stock or options as compensation, they can not share
long-term-incentive with project members swiftly, globally nor at a low-cost.
Current fundraising solutions for new products/services are not globally oriented and
are usually slow. Additionally, some people can not accept payments because they are
unable to open bank accounts or are unable to make a promise as a public record.
We would like to create an ecosystem where everyone in the world can easily
participate by using a decentralized infrastructure, Ethereum.

~ From IPO To IPO & ICO Age ~

The above is a visualization of the traditional IPO timeline. It will take about 5 years for
a shareholder to sell stocks, before which it is almost impossible to sell unlisted stocks
to someone.
In most cases venture capitals or angels have to take a high financial risk for supporting
it. A similar risk is present with the founders and co-workers which work in startups.
However, currently many new projects are doing ICOs, and can sell their tokens in
addition to quickly gain many new team members around the globe.
Thanks to the decentralized value network, permissionless blockchain, somewhere
between 1 month and 2 years after the crowdsale, the core teams’ tokens can be traded
on public crypto currency exchanges, and get some returns..
By adapting this mechanism, supporters can take engage in low risk support of new
startups and ventures. e to this, new startups and ventures can have more supporters
globally, and may be able to easily fundraise a bigger amount quickly.

Starbase will firstly focus on the Ethereum blockchain and the standard type of tokens,
ERC20 tokens.
Starbase team believes there will be thousands of tokens in the world to create new
innovations, currently there are 600+ tokens and $20B+ market cap, and Starbase
would like to support token issuance, sale & payment, especially for crowdsourcing.

Figure: Starbase overview
1.

Starbase provides a technical infrastructure for core teams to issue tokens or to
give tokens as work payments or as a long-term incentive.
2. Starbase provides a technical infrastructure for core teams to issue tokens in
order to raise funds.
3. Starbase provides a technical infrastructure for supporters to purchase tokens
in order to support the fundraisers of core teams.
4. Starbase provides a technical infrastructure for supporters to work ​for the core
team's project and receive tokens as long term incentive​. Token holders are
motivated to raise the value of said tokens.

Starbase Innovative Features
which contributes public blockchain economy

Starbase provides token based crowdfunding and crowdsourcing for non-blockchain
people. In order to achieve the purpose, we provide these features.
1. STAR Account
2. STAR Reward
3. STAR Protection
And we believe these features makes more non-blockchain people can use blockchain
token based system, and increase blockchain system utility.
Starbase starts from Ethereum blockchain to implement these functionalities.

Figure: A comparison between Starbase with other crowdfunding platform.

Starbase provides not only a global, fast, and simple fundraising solution at the
crowdfunding, but also supports the preparation for a “crowdsale” by
introducing “early purchasers”.
The Core team can pay their issued tokens for some jobs or commitments
before making the tokens transferrable in exchanges around the world.
The core teams can also make it easy for supporters to accept issued tokens
payment from core teams by calculating and visualizing the value of tokens
issued.

Starbase Platform Timeline For Core teams

Page 13

Figure: Core team flow who would like to use Starbase
Innovative projects who would like to use Starbase will follow the timeline of follow the
part of this timeline, such as using Starbase only for token issuance, only for token
sales, or
only for crowdsourcing (work payments).

1. Token Issuance Phase
Starbase
Consumable/Rewardable/inflationary
Token Issuance Templates
Starbase supports core team’s token issuance via the Starbase smart contract
templates.
The contract templates have 3 basic types of properties; they are:
1. Consumable. (Utility value)
2. Rewardable.
3. Inflationary.

|Copyright © 2016 - 2017 - Starbase All Rights Reserved |
of 53

Page 14

1.

Consumable means that the tokens can be used for the service/product.
Existing models of consumable tokens are Factoid, Ether, etc. By implementing
the consumable property, core teams can offer discount for the token holders.
Afterwards, the core teams’ token holder can expect to use the core team’s
service cheaper than users after launch. It has resemblance to Kickstarter.

2. Rewardable means that the token holders can receive rewards from the core
teams. Reward is paid by core teams from the launched project revenue by the
form of Ether and Tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, token holder
can expect the reward from the core teams, and get good returns from the
purchase if everything is going well.
3. Inflationary means that the core teams can issue more tokens after the first
crowdsale has finished. Core teams can pay newly issued tokens for their
platform contributor or sell it to the public for future financing.

Core team can combine these 3 properties with the property value, and make smart
contract for the core team’s token.
We will review them, and if everything is in order, then the Starbase system allows the
core team to issue token. Then they can start the campaign.

Figure 1. Consumable token issuance.

Figure 2. Rewardable token issuance

Figure 3. Inflationary token issuance.

Core teams which use Starbase platform can compose these token properties and issue
new tokens on the Ethereum platform.
For example: 1) A non-consumable, rewardable, non-inflationary token. 2) A
consumable, rewardable, non-inflationary token. 3) A consumable, non-rewardable,
inflationary token etc.

STAR Reward (Planning)
~ Reward system for projects’ Token Holders ~
Starbase implements 2 ways of rewarding functionalities for innovative
projects including those who don’t know or use blockchain technology.
1. STAR Reward - Deposit & Withdraw way
2. STAR Reward - Buyback projects’ token way
And these reward feature is fairly Starbase core feature to make more global
innovation grow with many stakeholders and supporters.
1- Deposit & Withdraw way
The STAR Reward system is on the Ethereum blockchain for STAR tokens, and
the core teams will be able to use the Ethereum blockchain for their platform
launch as well. For core teams’ token holders to receive rewards from the
core teams, they need to know the private keys of their addresses, or the
wallet provider should correspond with the reward payment.
If you deposit a core team’s token on some crypto currency exchange, and
the crypto currency exchange doesn’t treat the core team’s token reward
payment, you will lose the rewards.
In order to prevent the loss of reward payments, the Starbase reward system
is required. The Starbase reward system is designed with simplicity in mind. If
you would like to receive a core team’s reward, you need to claim that reward
yourself by using MyEtherWallet or MistWallet, or send the tokens to
Starbase and click the “Claim rewards” button.
Afterwards you will receive rewards from the core teams. This Starbase
reward system also applies to the STAR token. Therefore, for the STAR token
holders to receive rewards from Starbase, they need to send STAR tokens to
Starbase web application and click “Claim STAR token rewards” or use
MyEtherWallet, Mist wallet, Metamask, or the command line.
This reward mechanism is not only used for STAR token described below, but
also for other core teams’ tokens who will use Starbase platform.
2- Buyback projects’ tokens way

|Copyright © 2016 - 2017 - Starbase All Rights Reserved |
of 53

Page 17

The STAR Reward system for Buyback is based on trust of the project owner,
because currently we don’t have decentralized exchange which has verifiable
functionality of buying the project’s token.
Starbase is not crypto currency exchange, and don’t develop it. With
exchange partners, we will implement verifiable buyback feature. Then core
teams can buyback their tokens and can reward their token holders.
Until then, Starbase implements to interface to submit their claim of “They
bought x amount of their token” onto Ethereum blockchain, and also users of
Starbase which has their tokens can know the buyback reward.

Early Purchase System
The Starbase platform provides an early purchaser system for core teams
which issue tokens. This is fairly useful for getting the first budget for
marketing and development prior to the crowdsale.
Until the crowdsale finished, the core teams can not make changes to the
bonuses of crowdsale purchasers. Therefore, the Starbase early purchaser
token assignment mechanism provides decides the percentage of total tokens
which are assigned to early purchasers as a “bonus”
This early purchaser mechanism creates a big difference between token sale
and traditional crowdfunding/lending platforms. This makes core teams aim
to gather early angels and team members rapidly, globally, and swiftly for a
“rocket start”.
Here's the early purchase flow
1. Early purchaser deposit Bitcoin, Ether to the core team’s early
purchase address which is generated for each user’s unique ID. (i.e.
email address)
2. Deposited Bitcoin, Ether is automatically forwarded to early purchaser
address managed by the core team, not managed by Starbase.
3. Bitcoin and Ether are converted to some other currency, then the early
purchase will be written on the contract.
4. When crowdsale starts, crowdsale contract reads the early purchase
contract’s information, then the early purchases will be reflected for
the token balances.

|Copyright © 2016 - 2017 - Starbase All Rights Reserved |
of 53

Page 18

The Starbase Token will also use the early purchase system.
Details of the calculations are below.
After the crowdsale has finished, an early purchaser will receive:
{earlypurchaser_token_amount} = {earlypurchaser_token_amount} *
{earlypurchase_value}/{total_earlypurchase_value} +
{crowdsale_token_amount} *{earlypurchase_value}/ {earlypurchase_value}
+ {crowdsale_value}
After the crowdsale has finished, a crowdsale purchaser will receive,
{crowdsale_purchaser_token_amount} = {crowdsale_token_amount}
*{crowdsalePurchase_value}/ {earlypurchase_value} + {crowdsale_value}
Starbase will also introduce an early purchase system for the STAR token sale.
STAR Early purchase will be immediately finished when it reaches to 6 Million
CNY. The crowdsale token amount is 125,000,000 and early purchase bonus is
50,000,000.
If a crowdsale has “bonus” mechanism, early purchasers of the crowdsale
generally have the best rate of the bonus.
Definition:
Counter currency = Currency to use for the calculation purpose
earlypurchaser_token_amount = Total amount of token for all early
purchasers
earlypurchase_value = The amount of the counter currency the early
purchaser paid
total_earlypurchase_value = Total amount of the counter currency early
purchasers paid in total
crowdsale_token_amount = Total amount of token for all crowdsale
purchasers
crowdsale_value = The amount of the counter currency the crowdsale
purchase paid

2. Token Sales Phase
Starbase Rating & Due Diligence overview.
|Copyright © 2016 - 2017 - Starbase All Rights Reserved |
of 53

Page 19

The Starbase team will check the core team’s business and member profile,
and the technical detail.
Here’s the visual presentation:
http://www.slideshare.net/StarbaseGlobal/starbase-rating-due-diligence-fl
ow-71018567
Here’s the overview for core teams to issue tokens:

Starbase rating system
All core teams which are formally checked by the Starbase platform will be
rated by Starbase’s rating partner or the Starbase company. Different rating
partners’ ratings are shown as unique rating.
If a core team’s rating is low, then supporters will receive a notification when
they want to support said core team such as “This core team project doesn’t
have good rating”.
Rating is important to select core teams for early purchase phase. The
Starbase platform will try to have multiple rating partners and make it very
informative for any supporter who takes a risk by supporting them.
The rating fees for rating partners are paid by the Starbase company revenue.
The Starbase company will contribute to the Starbase platform in order to
improve the rating system and provide good project suggestions for users.

Starbase due diligence process
All core teams who which are formally checked and rated by Starbase can
submit a “Crowdsale request”. In order for the request to be approved, core
teams will be due diligenced by the Starbase incubator partners or the
Starbase company.
After said process is over, it’s either shown as “Approved by
{due_diligence_partner} / Approved by Starbase company”. or it’s shown as
“Rejected by {due_diligence_partner} / Rejected by Starbase company”.
Until the due diligence process has not been passed the core team can not
start crowdsale.

|Copyright © 2016 - 2017 - Starbase All Rights Reserved |
of 53

Page 20

And if the voting points for each elements are low, then they can not start due
diligence process with Starbase due diligence partner.
The fees for due diligence partners are paid by the Starbase company
revenue. The Starbase company will contribute to the Starbase platform to
improve the due diligence system and deliver good and innovative projects
for supporters who are passionate about supporting such projects by
investing or working in them.

3. ICO & After ICO Phase
Milestone Payments & ICO for core teams

Milestone payment flow

All core teams who use Starbase platform won’t get money instantly after
they sold tokens to the public. The raised money is escrowed by Starbase, a
3rd party team, and the core team.
The Core team should send a “Release milestone” request to Starbase and 3rd
party team, and if the set milestone is actually fulfilled, then the core team
can receive a part of the payment.
|Copyright © 2016 - 2017 - Starbase All Rights Reserved |
of 53

Page 21

We define “ICO” as “Change the status of a issued token to transferable from
non transferable”. In order for core teams to do a ICO, they are recommended
to be reviewed by 3rd party and prove that they created the service/product
that they promised. We will support the mechanism with a 3rd party partner.

STAR Reward (Execution)
~ Reward system for projects’ Token Holders ~
As mentioned at STAR Reward (Planning) section, Starbase implements 2 ways
of rewarding functionalities for innovative projects including those who don’t
know or use blockchain technology.
1. STAR Reward - Deposit & Withdraw way
2. STAR Reward - Buyback projects’ token way
Core teams can use these reward mechanism for rewarding their token
holders.
1. Deposit & Withdraw way
Core teams need to deposit their Ether or tokens to STAR Reward rewarding
contract for core teams, and tokens holders can withdraw Ether or tokens
from the contract.
In order to deposit, core teams input Ether amount and the memo of the
information, and can deposit
2. Buyback way
Core teams can buyback their tokens by Ether to reward their token holders.
When core teams system wants to pay rewards for their token holders, the
core team or another agents buy their tokens from the exchanges.
Then the price of tokens will increase and existing token holders can be
rewarded from the price change.

Price Lock Payment System
|Copyright © 2016 - 2017 - Starbase All Rights Reserved |
of 53

Page 22

Core teams want to pay their tokens also after ICO for sharing the middle or
long term incentive. Price lock payment system is a solution for that. By
using price lock payment, users can pay tokens to other Ethereum address
only when the token’s price is above some price.
There will be liquidity issue, if the token doesn’t have liquidity, it doesn’t need
much cost to price manipulation for unlocking the payment. But if we have a
decent time span to measure the price, it’ll be harder to manipulate the price.
In a 2nd year operation, Starbase will implement that kind of mechanism.

STAR Account

Starbase implements STAR Account system which is similar to Bitgo like 2 of
3 multisignature account.
Starbase server aims not to control users’ funds, and users can manage their
funds by themselves easily ​without blockchain knowledge​. Here's how
"STARAccount" works:
1. STAR Account system is 2 of 3 multisig, users hold tokens by their own
hands, because Starbase only holds 1 key of the 3 keys

|Copyright © 2016 - 2017 - Starbase All Rights Reserved |
of 53

Page 23

2. With 2 of 3 signatures, users can execute certain transactions like transfer,
receive rewards.
3. Users can sign by themselves using 1 keys encrypted by transaction
password, and the other is on Starbase server
4. And the transaction will be broadcasted from the user’s client or the
Starbase server to the network and transaction will be executed.
STAR Account is basis for STAR Reward mechanism (Deposit and Withdraw
type reward distribution contract) and STAR Protection (Escrow with Put
option) mechanism.

STAR Protection
STAR Account For Releasing Funds To Core Team
It’s important for core teams to have escrow mechanism for increasing their
trustability.
From Starbase web application, core teams can find escrow partner and create
their 2 of 3 wallets, “STAR Account” one.
By using the mechanism, core teams can not run away and prove they will likely
to fulfill the promise.Escrow mechanism is commonly used for blockchain
projects, and blockchain people, it’s easy to create escrow wallet and system by
themselves and use it, but non-blockchain companies it’s still difficult to create
them and utilize it.

STAR Protection
Put option for sold tokens
STAR Protection aims to protect token purchasers of a project. Core team can
choose to make put option for going to raise/raised funds.
By promising minimum price of token by smart contract, token purchasers can
limit their loss.

|Copyright © 2016 - 2017 - Starbase All Rights Reserved |

Page 24

Upgradable Core Team Address
All core teams which use the Starbase platform will have a project owner
address on the Ethereum blockchain. This address is a multisignature
address. Therefore, if the Core team loses one of their keys, they can recover
it by making a request to Starbase.
Even in case that the Starbase platform gets hacked, the core team can not
lose control of their issued token, because Starbase doesn’t have control to
the project owner address.
This address mechanism is generally the same as with the most used multisig
wallet contracts on Ethereum. We will release the project owner address on
Starbase public github repository.

Starbase Revenue Projection
The Starbase platform revenue is coming from the following 3 sources and
revenue is distributed to the STAR holders. The important fee structure
ensures that Starbase doesn’t take fees from investors, or payees.
1. Token issuance fee. When the core team’s new token is issued by using
the Starbase platform, the Starbase platform takes a operational fee for
newly issued tokens.

|Copyright © 2016 - 2017 - Starbase All Rights Reserved |
of 53

Page 25

Figure 1: Token issuance fee
2. Crowdsale fee. When the core team’s issued tokens are purchased by
supporters, Starbase takes a fee as a platform.

Figure: 2. Crowdsale fee
3. Crowdsourcing work payment fee. When the core team’s issued tokens
paid for supporters, such as freelancers, engineers, team members,
marketers, legal professional etc, then the Starbase platform takes a
payment fee. The fee is only applicable when the payer uses a Starbase

|Copyright © 2016 - 2017 - Starbase All Rights Reserved |
of 53

Page 26

smart contract for their work payment which is similar as to most
crowdsourcing platforms.

Figure: 3. Work payment fees
These 3 types of fee rates will be adjusted by the Starbase company in order
to meet the market needs of core teams and supporters.
If within 5 years:
- Starbase supports 271 core teams token sale & issuance
Average (expected) token sale amount: $500,000
Average token sale fee: $37,500
Average issued token valuation: $1,500,000
Average crowdsale token fee by one client (USD): $112,500
- Starbase supports 43,350 work payments,
Average work value: $2,000
Average fee per work : $100
Then, within 5 years there will be:
271 * ($37,500 + $112,500) + 43,350 works * $100 = $44M Starbase platform
revenue distribution.
Therefore, 1 STAR token holder will generally receive $0.011 equivalent ETH &
Core teams’ tokens.
If within 5 years,
- Starbase platform supports 0 core teams token sale & issuance
Average(expected) token sale amount: $500,000
|Copyright © 2016 - 2017 - Starbase All Rights Reserved |
of 53

Page 27

Average token sale fee: $37,500
Average issued token valuation: $1,500,000
Average crowdsale token fee by one client (USD): $112,500
- Starbase platform supports 0 work payments,
Average work value: $2,000
Average fee per work : $100
Then,within 5 years, there will be
0 * ($37,500 + $112,500) + 0 works * $100
= $0 Starbase platform revenue distribution.
So 1 STAR token holder will receive generally $0 amount of ETH & Core teams’
tokens.

Starbase Incubator Partners
Starbase will have incubator partners around the world to spread the idea and to
enable global innovation. Incubator partners are to generally introduce the token
based funding/team-making system to startups as alternative. If said startups want to
use it, they will be able to use Starbase. If they decide to do so, then they will do the
due diligence process with partner instead of the Starbase company, it’s described by
the Starbase Due Diligence System in a later part of this documents.
Jan, 2017 - Takumi Innovators and XNode became official incubator partners in China.

Starbase Rating Partners
Starbase recommends rating partners for core teams who needs rating to increase
their trustability or core teams can find by themselves and put the rating information
with the rating company name reference.
Now, Starbase has ICORating, a global leading rating company who is professionally
specialized in ICO projects. And in the long run, Starbase company will have another
rating partners as recommendation.
One of important reasons we recommends some rating companies as "rating parnter"
is that it’s useful for supporters who don't know blockchain or crypto currency market
to know about reliable rating companies.

Jan, 2017 - ICORating became our rating partner.

Target User Segments

In order to have market adaption, it’s important to target unique user segments.
Starbase targets these user segments.
1st step (2017Q4- 2018Q2 -Q4)
-

Core team:
Innovative startups or individuals who needs private crowdfunding first.
Starbase helps designing tokens by token templates, and then support
token issuance & token allocation & private sale of tokens by themselves.
Currently in crowdfunding market place, it’s difficult to start
crowdfunding privately as “Early purchase” or “Early contribution” way,
but in blockchain world, it’s more easy to do private sale of core team
tokens as long as supporters believing in the core team.

-

Supporter:
Blockchain related purchasers, engineers, designers who want to support
globally innovative projects by purchasing tokens or working for them.

|Copyright © 2016 - 2017 - Starbase All Rights Reserved |
of 53

Page 33

In the current world, it’s difficult for supporting other countries project
by investing in them. But by using tokens, as long as they can buy some
crypto currencies in their country from their fiat currencies, they will be
able to support any countries’ projects.
In 1st step, Starbase mainly focuses on token purchasers who already
have crypto currencies, are interesting in blockchain, or are interesting in
investing global innovative projects as target audiences, because our first
important step is to gather good core teams, and good core teams would
like to have token purchasers as fast as possible
2nd step (2018Q2-Q4 - 2019Q4)
-

Core team:
IaaS, PaaS, SaaS startups who has software licenses or intangible value
transactions in their platform or their service, whether it’s B2C(Business
to Customer),B2B or C2C platform.

-

Supporter:
In 2nd step, Starbase still continue to focus on those who want to
purchase or have innovative project tokens. Starbase try to make tokens
value as easy as possible to understand by showing value converted to $
or BTC exchanged value with the tokens, and the core team’s
information.

3rd step (2019Q4 ~ )
- Core team:
Starbase considers the world will have more regulations and rules for
blockchain tokens, and more and more companies will be able to adapt
blockchain tokens without concerning regulatory or tax issues.
Starbase targets those who would like to start new global projects in
middle or big companies.
-

Supporters:
Starbase expands targets freelancers or those who want to work for
startups.

STAR Token (Symbol: STAR) Sale

Starbase will issue initial 1 Billion (= 1,000,000,000) Starbase Tokens
(Currency symbol: “STAR”).
The STAR shall have an input functionality, which allows a digital input
function to receive user fees, generated in the operation of the Starbase
platform
If you saw before ver 0.4x whitepaper, please refer to important term change
for regulatory reason from ​here​.
STAR token initial allocation is as follows:
12.5 %: Public sale
5%: Early Purchaser Bonus
1.25%: Reward for marketing campaign
6.25%: Founders and Early contributors.
75%: Starbase company.

|Copyright © 2016 - 2017 - Starbase All Rights Reserved |
of 53

Page 35

And all STAR token allocated to 75% of Starbase company are non
transferable in the first year operation, and every year 12.5% of STAR
becomes transferable as described in the following section.

STAR Consumption (Utility value of STAR)
1. STAR holders can use pay STAR in the Starbase platform for token based
crowdfunding and crowdsourcing.
2. STAR holders can vote on STAR DD system by the amount of STAR
Starbase platform provide tools for users easy to accept the payment of STAR
for their work. And according to STAR market price, STAR payment acceptors
can change how many STARs they need for their work service.
In Ethereum, Factom like decentralized platform, Factoid, Ether can be
converted to Entry credit or Gas to receive decentralized service with stable
value. Starbase would like to achieve similar system by the price conversion
mechanism provided from Starbase platform price systems.

STAR Reward for STAR holders
The STAR is a rewardable token. The Starbase platform pays a reward to STAR
holders from the Starbase platform future revenue. The maximum reward
amount is capped to 100 times of the Starbase fundraised amount at the STAR
sale.
The reward is given out from the Starbase revenue as described. All Starbase
platform revenue. Rewards are distributed on the Ethereum blockchain, and
STAR holders can claim and receive rewards proportional to their owned
amount of STARs.

|Copyright © 2016 - 2017 - Starbase All Rights Reserved |
of 53

Page 36

Starbase reward payment will occur every quarter and STAR holders can claim
rewards either on the Ethereum blockchain, through the Starbase website, or
via 3rd party Ethereum wallet collaborator.
STAR holders will earn Ether, ERC20 type Tokens, and STAR on the Ethereum
blockchain, because Starbase revenue is from 1. Token sale fees, 2. Token
issuance fees, 3. Work payment fees.
Revenues from the first source is distributed by Ethereum, and from sources 2
& 3 is distributed by the Ethereum token issued by the core team.

|Copyright © 2016 - 2017 - Starbase All Rights Reserved |
of 53

Page 37

The Ethereum token rewards are good for core teams who use Starbase. If
there are 20 000 STAR holders, then the core team can distribute their project
tokens to 20,000 individuals which are likely to support their project or invest
more.
In order to receive rewards, all STAR holders needs to use an Ethereum wallet
such as “Mist” ​https://github.com/ethereum/mist​ or the Starbase platform in
order to claim rewards from there.
This is to insure the safety of the token holders, some tokens may disappear in
non-aware wallets, such as cryptocurrency exchanges.

STAR Inflation

STAR has inflation mechanism. After the token becomes transferrable after the
Starbase platform launch, then the STAR inflation will commence. A specific
token address, which is held by the Starbase company, will receive new tokens
from the inflation.
The new tokens from inflation will all be used for the Starbase platform
development, marketing, and legal contingencies.
Maximum inflation is 2.5 % per year + 0.5% * {total_reward_paid_out}/
{total_tokensold_amount} in total.

For example, if the Starbase platform is in its 3rd year of operation and has paid
out 3 times the fundraised amount of Ether and Ethereum tokens on the
ethereum blockchain to allSTAR holders, then the maximum inflation by the
Starbase company can be 2.5 * 3 + 0.5 % * 3 = 9 % in total.

STAR Lockup Mechanism
~ For Starbase Company ~
At the initial year, all STAR allocated to Starbase company are not-transferable
tokens.
STAR becomes transferable only when Starbase company does crowdsale for further
development and marketing of Starbase platform once in a year.
And the crowdsale time is once in a year, maximum tokens sold will be below 125M
(=12.5%) and the discount rate in the sale depends on the market condition. And it’ll
be about 10%
Not-sold STARs at the sale will be locked again for 6 months.

STAR Lockup Mechanism
~ For Founders and Early Contributors ~
The Starbase founders and early contributor’s tokens can not be transferred within 1
year. After 1 year has passed then 1/52 of the amount can be transferred weekly.
For example, if an early contributor has 520,000 tokens at the time of the Starbase
platform release, then they can transfer 10,000 ​STAR​ per week after 1 year has
passed since the platform launch.
In Starbase case, tokens allocated to Starbase founders and early contributors’
tokens are lock-uped in this way.

Starbase in the Permissionless Blockchain
Ecosystem
Starbase mission in the permissionless blockchain context is to increase the
non-blockchain user utilization of the global permissionless blockchain as
“internet of value” for new projects..
Summary:
1. Make more non-blockchain users utilize blockchain, global “Internet of
Value”.
2. Starbase focuses on token issuance & reward payment functionalities
more than token transfer, exchange functionalities.
3. Starbase enable more innovative projects easily doing bounty campaign
4. Starbase enable more innovative projects easily doing token issuance
5. Provide new token issuance templates for core teams.

Merits of Using the Ethereum Blockchain
By using Ethereum for the Starbase platform development, then users can
gain the following:
1.

More liquidity than any other token types, because they can be easily
listed on cryptocurrency exchanges. We will issue tokens using the
ERC 20 standard which most commonly used. It is the same standard
as with REP, DGD, MKR, SNGLS, etc.)

2. High security as many savvy engineers are already using it, and the
core is also rapidly being maintained.
3. Transparent smart contract which can be used under reliable token

conditions.
4. Ethereum has the second market cap in the crypto currencies, and
decentralized large network and general computation platform
already.

Abstract
A peer-to-peer cloud storage network implementing client-side encryption would allow users to transfer and share data without reliance on a
third party storage provider. The removal of central controls would mitigate most traditional data failures and outages, as well as significantly
increase security, privacy, and data control. Peer-to-peer networks are
generally unfeasible for production storage systems, as data availability
is a function of popularity, rather than utility. We propose a solution in
the form of a challenge-response verification system coupled with direct
payments. In this way we can periodically check data integrity, and offer rewards to peers maintaining data. We further propose a model for
addressing access and performance concerns with a set of independent or
federated nodes.

Introduction

Cloud storage has come to rely almost exclusively on large storage providers acting as trusted third parties to transfer and store data. This system suffers from
the inherent weaknesses of a trust-based model. Because client-side encryption is nonstandard, the traditional cloud is vulnerable to a variety of security
threats, including man-in-the-middle attacks, malware, and application flaws
that expose private consumer and corporate data. Moreover, because many
storage devices rely on the same infrastructure, failures is correlated across files
and systems.
A decentralized cloud storage network offers many advantages compared to
datacenter-based cloud storage. Data security can be maintained using clientside encryption, while data integrity will be maintained via a proof of retrievability. The impact of infrastructure failures and security breaches will be greatly
reduced. An open market for data storage may drive down costs for various
storage services by enabling more parties to compete using existing devices.
Data on the network will be resistant to censorship, tampering, unauthorized
access, and data failures. This paper describes a concrete implementation of
such a network, and a set of tools for interacting with that network.

Design

Storj is a protocol that creates a distributed network for the formation and
execution of storage contracts between peers. The Storj protocol enables peers
on the network to negotiate contracts, transfer data, verify the integrity and
availability of remote data, retrieve data, and pay other nodes. Each peer is
an autonomous agent, capable of performing these actions without significant
human interaction. Many of the basic tools for these interactions are described
in this document. Full protocol documentation can be found elsewhere [1].

2.1

Files as Encrypted Shards

A shard is a portion of an encrypted file to be stored on this network. Sharding
has a number of advantages to security, privacy, performance, and availability.
Files should be encrypted client-side before being sharded. The reference
implementation uses AES256-CTR, but convergent encryption or any other desirable system could be implemented. This protects the content of the data

2

from the storage provider, or farmer, housing the data. The data owner retains
complete control over the encryption key, and thus over access to the data.
The data owner may separately secure knowledge of how a file is sharded
and where in the network the shards are located. As the set of shards in the
network grows, it becomes exponentially more difficult to locate any given shard
set without prior knowledge of their locations (see Section 6.3). This implies
that security of the file is proportional to the square of the size of the network.
Shard size is a negotiable contract parameter. To preserve privacy, it is
recommended that shard sizes be standardized as a byte multiple, such as 8 or
32 MB. Smaller files may be filled with zeroes or random data. Standardized
sizes dissuade side-channel attempts to determine the content of a given shard,
and can mask the flow of shards through the network.
Sharding large files like video content and distributing the shards across
nodes reduces the impact of content delivery on any given node. Bandwidth
demands are distributed more evenly across the network. In addition, the enduser can take advantage of parallel transfer, similar to BitTorrent [2] or other
peer-to-peer networks.
Because peers generally rely on separate hardware and infrastructure, data
failure is not correlated. This implies that creating redundant mirrors of shards,
or applying a parity scheme across the set of shards is an extremely effective
method of securing availability. Availability is proportional to the number of
nodes storing the data.

1. Files are encrypted.
2. Encrypted files are split into shards, or multiple files are combined to form
a shard.

3. Audit pre-processing is performed for each shard (see Section 2.3).
4. Shards may be transmitted to the network.

2.2

Kademlia and Modifications

Storj is built on Kademlia [3], a distributed hash table (DHT). It is important
to note that shards are not stored in the hash table. Rather, Kademlia creates a
distributed network with efficient message routing and other desirable qualities.
Storj adds several message types, and enhancements to core Kademlia functionality (see Appendix A). In the future, the hash table may be used as a store for
data location information, or other purposes.

2.2.1

Signature Verification

Similar to S/Kademlia [4], the Storj network requires peers to sign messages.
To join the network a node must create an ECDSA keypair, (kpriv , kpub ). The
Kademlia Node ID corresponds to ripemd160(sha256(kpub )). As such, each
Node ID in the Storj network is also a valid Bitcoin address, which the node
can spend from. Nodes sign all messages, and validate message signatures before processing messages. This modification enforces long-term identity on the
network, and provides a proof of work deterrent to Eclipse attacks on Kademlia
routing (see Section 5.2). In the future there are a variety of other uses for this
address.

2.3

Proofs of Retrievability

Proofs of retrievability guarantee the existence of a certain piece of data on a
remote host. The ideal proof minimizes message size, can be calculated quickly,
requires minimal pre-processing, and provides a high degree of confidence that
the file is available and intact. To provide knowledge of data integrity and
availability to the data owner, Storj provides a standard format for issuing and
verifying proofs of retrievability via a challenge-response interaction called an
audit or heartbeat.
Our reference implementation uses Merkle trees [5] and Merkle proofs. After
the sharding process the data owner generates a set of n random challenge salts
s0 , s1 , ...sn−1 and stores the set of salts s. The challenge salts are each prepended
to the data d, and the resulting string is hashed to form a pre-leaf p as such:
pi = H(si + d). Pre-leaves are hashed again, and the resulting digests become
4

the set of leaves l of a standard Merkle tree such that li = H(H(si + d)). The
leaf set is filled with hashes of a blank string until its cardinality is a power of
two, to simplify the proof process.

Figure 2: Storj Audit Tree with |l| = 4
Red outlines indicate the elements of a Merkle proof for s0
The data owner stores the set of challenges, the Merkle root and the depth
of the Merkle tree, then transmits the Merkle trees leaves to the farmer. The
farmer stores the leaves along with the shard. Periodically, the data owner
selects a challenge from the stored set, and transmits it to the farmer. Challenges
may be selected according to any reasonable pattern, but should not be reused.
The farmer uses the challenge and the data to generate the pre-leaf. The preleaf, along with the set of leaves, is used to generate a Merkle proof, which is
sent back to the data owner.
The Storj Merkle proof always consists of exactly log2 (|l|) + 1 hashes, and
thus is a compact transmission, even for large trees. The data owner uses
the stored Merkle root and tree depth to verify the proof by verifying that its
length is equal to the tree depth and the hashes provided recreate the stored
root. This scheme does not allow false negatives or false positives, as the hash
function requires each bit to remain intact to produce the same output.

5

2.3.1

Partial Audits

The Merkle tree audit scheme requires significant computational overhead for
the data owner, as the entire shard must be hashed many times to generate
pre-leaves. An extension of this scheme utilizes subsets of the data to perform
partial audits, reducing computational overhead. This also has the advantage
of significantly reducing I/O burden on farmer resources.
This extension relies on two additional selectable parameters: a set of byte
indices x within the shard and a set of section lengths in bytes, b. The data
owner stores a set of 3-tuples (s, x, b). To generate pre-leaf i, the data owner
prepends si to the bi bytes found at xi . During the audit process, the verifier
transmits (s, x, b)i , which the farmer uses to generate a pre-leaf. The Merkle
proof is generated and verified as normal.

Figure 3: Storj Audit Tree with |l| = 4 and Partial Audits
Red outlines indicate the elements of a Merkle proof for s0
Partial audits provide only probabilistic assurance that the farmer retains
the entire file. They allow for false positive results, where the verifier believes the
farmer retains the intact shard, when it has actually been modified or partially
deleted. The probability of a false positive on an individual partial audit is
easily calculable (see Section 6.4)
6

Thus the data owner can have a known confidence level that a shard is
still intact and available. In practice, this is more complex, as farmers may
implement intelligent strategies to attempt to defeat partial audits. Fortunately,
this is a bounded problem in the case of iterative audits. The probability of
several consecutive false positives becomes very low, even when small portions
of the file have been deleted.
In addition, partial audits can be easily mixed with full audits without restructuring the Merkle tree or modifying the proof verification process. Many
audit strategies that mix full and partial verification can be envisioned, each of
which provides different levels of confidence over time.
A further extension of this scheme could use a deterministic seed instead of
a set of byte indexes. This seed would be used to generate indexes of many nonconsecutive bytes in the file. Requiring many non-consecutive random bytes
would provide additional resistance against malicious farmers attempting to
implement audit evasion strategies without significant extra overhead from processing or I/O.

2.3.2

Other Proof-of-Retrievability Schemes

Other audit schemes were examined, but deemed generally unfeasible. For example, Shacham and Waters proposed a compact proof [6] with several advantages over Merkle-tree schemes. This construction allows for an endless stream
of challenges to be generated by the data owner with minimal stored information. It also allows for public verifiability of challenge responses.
However, initial implementations indicate that the client-side pre-processing
required for the Shacham-Waters scheme requires at least one order of magnitude more computation time than hash-based methods, rendering it too slow
for most applications.
Proof of retrievability is an area of ongoing research, and other practical
schemes may be discovered in the future. As proof of retrievability schemes
are discovered and implemented, the choice of scheme may become a negotiable
contract parameter. This would allow each data owner and node to implement
a wide variety of schemes, and select the most advantageous scheme for a given
purpose.

7

2.3.3

Issuing Audits

To issue audits, Storj extends the Kademlia message set with a new type: AUDIT (for a full list of Kademlia extensions, see Appendix A). These messages
are sent from data owners to farmers and contain the hash of the data and a
challenge. The farmer must respond with a Merkle proof as described above.
Upon receipt and validation of the Merkle proof, the data owner must issue
payment to the farmer according to agreed-upon terms.

Figure 4: Issuing and Verifying Storj Audits

2.4

Contracts and Negotiation

Data storage is negotiated via a standard contract format [7]. The contract is a
versioned data structure that describes the relationship between data owner and
farmer. Contracts should contain all information necessary for each node to form
a relationship, transfer the data, create and respond to audits over time, and
arbitrate payments. This includes shard hash, shard size, audit strategy, and
payment information. Storj implements a publish/subscribe system to connect
parties interested in forming a contract (see Section 2.6).
Each party should store a signed copy of the contract. Contracts exist solely
for the benefit of the data owner and farmer, as no other node can verify the
terms or state of the relationship. In the future, contract information may be
stored in the DHT, or in an external ledger like a Blockchain, which may allow
some outside verification of relationship terms.
The contracting system extends Kademlia with four new message types:
OFFER, CONSIGN, MIRROR, and RETRIEVE.
To negotiate a contract, a node creates an OFFER message and sends it
to a prospective partner. Prospective partners are found via the publish/sub8

scribe system described in Section 2.6. The OFFER message contains a fullyconstructed contract that describes the desired relationship. The two nodes
repeatedly swap signed OFFER messages. For each new message in the OFFER loop, the node either chooses to terminate negotiations, respond with a
new signed counter-offer, or accept the contract by countersigning it. Once an
OFFER is signed by both parties, they each store it locally, keyed by the hash
of the data.
Once an agreement is reached, the data owner sends a CONSIGN message
to the farmer. The message contains the leaves of the audit-tree. The farmer
must respond with a PUSH token that authorizes the data owner to upload the
data via HTTP transfer (see Section 2.10). This token is a random number,
and can be delegated to a third party.
RETRIEVE messages signify the intent to retrieve a shard from a farmer.
These messages are nearly identical to CONSIGN messages, but do not contain
the audit-tree leaves. The farmer responds to a valid RETRIEVE message
with a PULL token that authorizes download of the data via a separate HTTP
transfer.
MIRROR messages instruct a farmer to retrieve data from another farmer.
This allows data owners to create redundant copies of a shard without expending
significant additional bandwidth or time. After a successful OFFER/CONSIGN
process, the data owner may initiate a separate OFFER loop for the same data
with another farmer. Instead of issuing a CONSIGN message to the mirroring
farmer, the data owner instead issues a RETRIEVE message to the original
farmer, and then includes the retrieval token in a MIRROR message to the
mirroring farmer. This authorizes the mirroring farmer to retrieve the data
from the original farmer. The success of the MIRROR process should be verified
immediately via an AUDIT message.

2.5

Payment

Storj is payment agnostic. Neither the protocol nor the contract requires a
specific payment system. The current implementation assumes Storjcoin, but
many other payment types could be implemented, including BTC, Ether, ACH
transfer, or physical transfer of live goats.
The reference implementation will use Storjcoin micropayment channels,
which are currently under development [8]. Micropayment channels allow for
pairing of payment directly to audit, thus minimizing the amount of trust necessary between farmers and data owners. However, because data storage is
9

inexpensive, audit payments are incredibly small, often below $0.000001 per
audit.
Storjcoin allows much more granular payments than other candidate currencies, thereby minimizing trust between parties. In addition, the mechanics of
micropayment channels require the total value of the channel to be escrowed for
the life of the channel. This decreases currency velocity, and implies that value
fluctuations severely impact the economic incentives of micropayment channels.
The use of a separate token creates a certain amount of insulation from outside
volatility, and Storjcoin’s large supply minimizes the impact of token escrow on
the market.
New payment strategies must include a currency, a price for the storage, a
price for retrieval, and a payment destination. It is strongly advised that new
payment strategies consider how data owners prove payment, and farmers verify
receipt without human interaction. Micropayment networks, like the Lightning
Network [9], Implementation details of other payment strategies are left as an
exercise for interested parties.

2.6

Quasar

Storj implements a peer-to-peer publish/subscribe system called Quasar [10][11].
Quasar offers topic-based pub/sub utilizing Bloom filters [12]. Topics describe
ranges of contract parameters the broadcasting node desires, including contract
size and bandwidth commitment. The topic list is standardized on the protocol level, and easily extensible [13]. This facilitates the contract offer and
negotiation process by ensuring messages reach interested nodes (see Section
2.4)
To operate Quasar, Storj extends Kademlia with three new message types:
SUBSCRIBE, UPDATE, and PUBLISH. These messages facilitate the creation
and propagation of filters. Each node maintains information about topics to
which it subscribes, as well as topics to which its neighbors subscribe in the
form of an attenuated Bloom filter with depth K = 3. The filter at level 1
represents the subscriptions of nodes one hop away.
SUBSCRIBE requests filter lists from neighbors. To build an initial filter
list, nodes issue SUBSCRIBE messages to their three nearest neighbors. Nodes
respond to a SUBSCRIBE with their current filter list. The requesting node
adds the received filter lists to its own attenuate Bloom filter.
UPDATE pushes local filter changes to the three nearest neighbors. When

10

a node subscribes to a new topic it must issue a SUBSCRIBE request to learn
about its neighbors states, then an UPDATE request to notify neighbors of its
new subscription. By exchanging filter lists via SUBSCRIBE/UPDATE loops
nodes gain progressively better knowledge of what information is desirable to
their neighbors, and to nodes reachable by their neighbors.
PUBLISH broadcasts a message to the network. In Storj, these are typically public announcements of partially-constructed contracts (see Section 2.4).
PUBLISH messages are sent to a nodes three nearest neighbors, and include a
topic parameter whose digest is compared to each filter in the filter list. If the
topic digest is found in the filter at K = 0, the node processes the message. If
the topic is found in any other filters in the filter list, the node forwards the
message to its neighbors. If no matching filter is found, the message is forwarded
to a randomly selected peer in that nodes routing table.
To prevent re-circulation of messages, nodes add their node ID to PUBLISH
messages when they are forwarded, indicating that that node has already received the message. When forwarding messages, nodes ignore other nodes whose
IDs are present in that list. This prevents redundant recirculation of messages
with minimal communication overhead.
PUBLISH messages also include a time-to-live (TTL) parameter, measured
in hops. Nodes will not relay messages whose hops have exceeded the TTL.
To prevent spam attacks, nodes will also refuse to relay messages whose TTL
exceeds the TTL that node would give a new message.
Because of this routing process based on subscription filters, PUBLISH messages propagate through the network randomly until they find a node whose
filter list contains a subscription or a false positive. Once a subscription is indicated by a filter, the message moves towards the subscriber quickly. If a false
positive is encountered the message resumes random routing.

2.7

Redundancy Schemes

Cloud object stores typically own or lease servers to store their customers files.
They use RAID schemes or a multi-datacenter approach to protect the file from
physical or network failure. Because Storj objects exist in a distributed network
of untrusted peers, farmers should not be relied upon to employ the same safety
measures against data loss as a traditional cloud storage company. Indeed,
farmers may simply turn off their node at any time. As such, it is strongly
recommended that the data owner implement redundancy schemes to ensure the
safety of their file. Because the protocol deals only with contracts for individual
11

shards, many redundancy schemes may be used. Three are described below.

2.7.1

Simple Mirroring

The simplest solution is to mirror shards across several nodes. Mirroring protects against hardware failures by ensuring that multiple copies of each shard
Qn
exist. Availability of the shard with this scheme is P = 1 − 0 an where an
is the uptime of the node storing shard n. Because all shards are required to
assemble the file, availability of the file is equal to the availability of the least
available shard. In the case of a dropped contract, a redundant copy of that
shard can be retrieved and a new location found for it on the network. This is
the current behavior of the reference implementation.

2.7.2

K-of-M Erasure Coding

Storj will soon implement client-side Reed-Solomon erasure coding [14]. Erasure
coding algorithms break a file into k shards, and programmatically create m
parity shards, giving a total of k + m = n shards. Any k of these n shards can
be used to rebuild the file or any missing shards. Availability of the file is then
Qm
P = 1 − 0 am across the set of the m + 1 least available nodes. In the case
of loss of individual shards, the file can be retrieved, the missing shard rebuilt,
and then a new contract negotiated for the missing shard.
To prevent loss of the file, data owners should set shard loss tolerance levels.
Consider a 20-of-40 erasure coding scheme. A data owner might tolerate the loss
of 5 shards out of 40, knowing that the chance of 16 more becoming inaccessible
in the near future is low. However, at some point the probabilistic availability
will fall below safety thresholds. At that point the data owner must initiate a
retrieve and rebuild process.
Because node uptimes are known via the audit process, tolerance levels may
be optimized based on the characteristics of the nodes involved. Many strategies
may be implemented to handle this process.
Erasure coding is desirable because it drastically decreases the probability of
losing access to a file. It also decreases the on-disk overhead required to achieve
a given level of availability for a file. Rather than being limited by the least
available shard, erasure coding schemes are limited by the least-available n + 1
nodes (see Section 6.1).

12

2.8

KFS

To facilitate on-disk storage for farmers, Storj implements a local file store
called KFS [15]. The farming client initially used the filesystem directly to
store shards. Later the farming client used a single LevelDB instance. Both of
these approaches failed to scale. For example, LevelDB compaction processing
time scales linearly with store size, and locks both reads and writes while in
progress. This significantly impacted performance and availability for nodes
storing more than 100GB. KFS is an abstraction layer over a set of LevelDB
instances that seeks to address scaling problems.

2.8.1

Rationale

LevelDB is a key-value store. It has many desirable qualities, including longterm support, portability, and high performing reads powered by lexicographically sorted keys. While LevelDB compaction is typically a desirable feature, it
severely limits scaling. Its impact is larger on lower end systems and can also
vary based on the type of disk in use. Compaction also blocks reads and writes
during this period, rendering Storj nodes effectively offline until the process
completes.
However, because LevelDB instances are cheap to create, open, and close,
compaction costs can be bounded by managing a set of size-limited LevelDB
instances. Instances can be initialized ad hoc, and opened and closed as necessary.
Horizontally scaling many LevelDB instances has a number of benefits to
scalability. Chiefly, it mitigates the impact compaction has on operations. Because compaction runs individually across each instance, rather than across the
whole data set, the issues compaction causes for scaling are minimized. Although compaction across the shard set as a whole will take approximately the
same amount of computation (compaction scales linearly with data), it now occurs separately for each instance. Which is to say, compaction is broken up into
256 smaller processes running independently.
With KFS compaction locks only individual buckets, leaving many others
available to read and write. Operations and compaction are distributed evenly
across hundreds of buckets, meaning the chance of an operation being blocked
by compaction is small. Whereas previously compaction would block the entire
shard set for several seconds (or longer on low-end hardware), it now blocks
only small sections of the shard set for a much shorter time period.

13

2.8.2

S-Buckets and Routing

Rather than a single large instance, KFS stores shards in B size-limited LevelDB
instances, called S-Buckets. Collectively S-Buckets L0 , L1 , LB−1 form the BTable. S-Buckets have a fixed maximum size in bytes, S. Thus the maximum
size of a KFS store is S ∗ B bytes. Storj currently uses S = 32 GiB and B = 256
for a total capacity of 8 TiB.
KFS requires that there be a reference identifier, which can be any arbitrary
R bit key where R ≥ log2 (B). Storj nodes will use their 160 bit Node ID.
Incoming shards are sorted into S-bucket according to the following method:
1. Let g = dlog2 (B)e.
2. Let h be the first g bits of R.
3. Let i be the first g bits of the shard hash.
4. Let n = h ⊕ i.
5. Store the shard in Ln .
This sorting algorithm is fast, deterministic, and uses only readily-available
information. Where B is a power of two, it also provides an even distribution
of shards across all S-Buckets, as shown in Figure 5 below.

Figure 5: XOR Distance of Random Bytes
S-Buckets that have reached S bytes cannot store more shards. Farmers
can determine if bucket Ln is full during contract negotiation by calculating n
14

using the data-hash field in the contract, and should reject contracts that would
cause them to overfill an S-Bucket. When all buckets in a KFS instance are
full, a second instance may be made. Given that the 8 TiB upper limit of a
farmers KFS instance is larger than most available drives, this is unlikely for
most hardware.

2.8.3

Keying By Shard Hash

As mentioned earlier, LevelDB sorts items lexicographically by key. KFS takes
advantage of this to optimize the efficiency of reads and writes. Data is stored
in chunks of C bytes (or less). By default C = 128 KiB. These chunks are keyed
by the full content’s hash followed by a space and a numerical index. This
ensures that key/value pairs are small, and that reads and writes to and from
a S-Bucket are sequential. It also allows for efficient streaming of data both in
and out of the S-bucket.
Because of the idiosyncrasies of sorting numerical strings lexicographically,
the index substring should be expressed in base 10, and have a constant number
S
of characters. The length l of the index string should be defined by l = dlog10 C
e.
For default parameters l = 6. Therefore the chunk at i = 3753 will have
the index number ’003753’. This ensures that chunks of a shard are stored
consecutively.
To preserve order and therefore maximize read/write performance, the keys
for the chunks of a specific shard should be strings generated as follows:

1. Determine the chunk index number, and encode it as a string.
2. Prepend the chunk index string with ’0’ until it reaches length l.
3. Encode H(data) as a string of hexadecimal characters.
4. Append a single space to the hash.
5. Append the modfied chunk index to the hash.

2.8.4

Performance Benefits

In initial testing KFS outperforms vanilla LevelDB in reads, writes, and unlinks
for a variety of file sizes. KFS displays lower means and lower variance across
almost all combinations of file size, operation, and storage device type. It particularly excels at unlinks and writes of large files, reducing variance by several
15

orders of magnitude. The full methodology of these tests, and their results, can
be found elsewhere [16].

Figure 6: Relative Performance of KFS and LevelDB

2.9

NAT Traversal and Reverse HTTP Tunneling

Due to the presence of NATs and other adverse network conditions, not all
devices are publicly accessible. To enable non-public nodes to participate in the
network, Storj implements a reverse tunnel system.
To facilitate this system, Storj extends Kademlia with three additional message types: PROBE, FIND TUNNEL, and OPEN TUNNEL The tunneling system also makes use of the publish/subscribe system detailed in section 2.6.
PROBE messages allow a node to determine whether it is publically addressable. The message is sent to a publicly addressable node, typically a known network seed. The receiving node issues a separate PING message. The receiving
node then responds to the PROBE message with the result of the PING. Nodes
joining the network should immediately send a PROBE to any known node.
Nodes that receive a negative response to their initial PROBE should issue
a FIND TUNNEL request to any known node. That node must respond with
three contacts that have previously published a tunnel announcement via the
publish/subscribe system. Tunnel providers must be publicly addressable.

16

Once the non-public node has received a list of tunnel providers, it issues
OPEN TUNNEL requests to the tunnel providers. The providers must provide
a tunnel for that node if they are capable. To open a connection, the provider
sends back an affirmative response with tunnel information. The tunneled node
then opens a long-lived connection to the provider, and updates its own contact
information to reflect the tunnel address.
Tunnels are operated over TCP sockets by a custom reverse-tunneling library, Diglet [17]. Diglet provides a simple and flexible interface for generalpurpose reverse tunneling. It is accessible both by command-line and programmatically.

2.10

Data Transfer

Data is transferred via HTTP [18]. Farmers expose endpoints where client
applications may upload or download shards. Clients’ requests are authenticated
via tokens provide by previous CONSIGN and RETRIEVE messages. This
transfer mechanism is not essential to the protocol, and many alternatives may
be implemented in the future.

3

Network Access

As should be apparent, the data owner has to shoulder significant burdens to
maintain availability and integrity of data on the Storj network. Because nodes
cannot be trusted, and hidden information like challenge sets cannot be safely
outsourced to an untrusted peer, data owners are responsible for negotiating contracts, pre-processing shards, issuing and verifying audits, providing payments,
managing file state via the collection of shards, managing file encryption keys,
etc. Many of these functions require high uptime and significant infrastructure,
especially for an active set of files. User run applications, like a file syncing
application, cannot be expected to efficiently manage files on the network.
To enable simple access to the network from the widest possible array of
client applications, Storj implements a thin-client model that delegates trust to
a dedicated server that manages data ownership. This is similar to the SPV
wallet concept found in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency ecosystems. The
burdens of the data owner can be split across the client and the server in a
variety of ways. By varying the amount of trust delegated, the server could also
provide a wide variety of other valuable services. This sort of dedicated server,

17

called Bridge, has been developed and released as Free Software. Any individual
or organization can run their own Bridge server to facilitate network access.

3.1

Bridge

Our reference implementation of this model consists of a Bridge server, and a
client library. Bridge provides an object store, which is to say, the primary
function of Bridge is to expose an API to application developers. Developers
should be able to use the Bridge via a simple client without requiring knowledge of the network, audit procedures, or cryptocurrencies. The Bridge API
is an abstraction layer that streamlines the development process. This enables
developers to create many applications that use the Storj network, allowing the
network to reach many users.
In the current implementation, Bridge assumes responsibility for contract
negotiation, audit issuance and verification, payments, and file state, while the
client is responsible for encryption, pre-processing, and file key management.
The Bridge exposes access to these services through a RESTful API. In this
way, the client can be completely naive of the Storj protocol and network while
still taking advantage of the network. In addition, because the dedicated server
can be relied on to have high uptime, the client can be integrated into unreliable
user-space applications.
Bridge is designed to store only metadata. It does not cache encrypted shards
and, with the exception of public buckets, does not hold encryption keys. The
only knowledge of the file that Bridge is able to share with third parties is
metadata such as access patterns. This system protects the client’s privacy and
gives the client complete control over access to the data, while delegating the
responsibility of keeping files available on the network to Bridge.
It is possible to envision Bridge upgrades that allow for different levels of
delegated trust. A Bridge client may want to retain control over issuing and
validating audits, or managing pointers to shards. Or a client may choose
to authorize two or more unrelated Bridges to manage its audits in order to
minimize the trust it places in either Bridge server. In the long run, any function
of the data owner can be split across two or more parties by delegating trust.

18

3.2

Bridge API and Client

Full documentation of the Bridge API is outside the scope of this whitepaper,
but is available elsewhere [19]. The first complete client implementation is in
JavaScript. Implementations in C, Python, and Java are in progress.
Because files cannot simply be POSTed to API endpoints, the structures
of the Bridge API and client are different from existing object stores. Clients
are implemented to hide the complexity of managing files on the storj network
through simple and familiar interfaces. As much as possible, complex network
operations are abstracted away behind simple function calls.
A brief summary of the upload process follows:

1. The client gathers and pre-processes data.
2. The client notifies Bridge of data awaiting upload.
3. Bridge negotiates contracts with network nodes.
4. Bridge returns the IP addresses of contracted nodes, and authorization
tokens to the client.
5. The client uses the IP addresses and tokens to contact the farming nodes
and upload the data.
6. The client transfers the audit information to the Bridge, delegating trust.
7. Bridge immediately issues an audit and verifies the response, to prove data
was transferred correctly.
8. Bridge assumes responsibility for issuing audits, paying farmers, and managing file state.
9. Bridge exposes file metadata to the client via the API.

The download process is similar.

1. The client requests a file by an identifier.
2. Bridge validates the request and provides a list of farmer IP addresses and
tokens.
3. The client uses the addresses and tokens to retrieve the file
4. The file is reassembled and decrypted client-side.
19

The JavaScript library accepts file, handles pre-processing, and manages
connections as directed by Bridge. It also makes decrypted downloads available
to applications as files, or as streams. A sample CLI using the library is available
as Free Software at https://github.com/storj/core-cli. It has been tested with a
wide variety of file sizes, and is capable of reliably streaming 1080p video from
the Storj network.

3.2.1

Application Development Tools

The primary function of Bridge and the Bridge API is to serve applications. To
this end clients and tools in a wide variety of languages are under development.
Storj.js[20] seeks to provide a standard in-browser interface for downloading
files from Storj. Though in early stages, it can already communicate with Bridge,
retrieve file pointers and tokens, retrieve shards from farmers, reassemble shards,
and append the completed file to the DOM. This allows web developers to easily
reference Storj objects from within a page, and rely on them being delivered
properly to the end user. This could be used to provide any service from inbrowser document editing to photo storage.
Key and file management tools for web backends are in early planning stages,
including Storj plugins for standard backend tools like content management
systems. These tools should help content-driven application developers work
with files on the Storj network. Standardizing these tools around permissioning
files by user could help create data portability between services as discussed in
section 4.2.
Bridges to other protocols and workflows are also planned. The Storj CLI
lends itself to shell scripting automation. Similar tools for FTP, FUSE, and
common tools for interacting with files will be developed in the future.

3.3

Bridge as an Authorization Mechanism

Bridge can be used to manage authorization for private files stored on the network. Because Bridge manages the state of each contract under its care, it is
a logical provider of these services. It can manage a variety of authorizationrelated services to enable sharing and collaboration.

20

3.3.1

Identity and Permissioning

The Bridge API uses public-key cryptography to verify clients. Rather than the
Bridge server issuing an API key to each user, users register public keys with
the Bridge. API requests are signed, and the Bridge verifies that the signature
matches a registered public key. Bridge organizes file metadata into buckets to
facilitate management. Buckets can be permissioned individually by registering
a set of public keys to the Bucket.
Application developers can use this to easily delegate permissions to applications, servers, or other developers. For instance, the developer of a file
syncing service could create a keypair for each user of that service, and divide
each user into a separate Bucket accessible only by that users keypair. Usage of
each Bucket is tracked separately, so users who have exceeded their allotment
could have write permissions revoked programmatically. This provides a logical
separation of user permissions, as well as a variety of organizational tools.

3.3.2

Key Migration

Because shard encryption keys are stored on the device that generated them,
data portability is an issue. The reference implementation of Bridge and the
client facilitate the transfer of file encryption keys between clients in a safe
way. Clients generate a cryptographically strong seed, by default a randomly
generated twelve word phrase. To encrypt a given file, the client generates a
key deterministically based on the seed, Bucket ID and File ID.
The user can import the seed one time to each new device, which permanantly keeps the devices syncronized. This also facilitates backup since users
only have to store the seed, not every newly generated file key.

3.3.3

Public Files

Bridge, like other object stores, allows developers to create and disseminate
public files via public Buckets. The Bridge server allows the developer to upload
the encryption key, and then allows anonymous users to retrieve the file key
and the set of file pointers. Public Buckets are useful for content delivery to
webpages, or to public-facing applications.
A system to share and retrieve public files without need of a Bridge could
also be created. Pointers and keys could be posted publicly on any platform, and
clients could be required to pay farmers directly for downloads. In practice this
21

would be very similar to an incentivized torrent. Platforms serving pointers
function similarly to trackers facilitating torrents. It is unclear whether this
system would have significant advantages over existing torrent networks.

3.3.4

File Sharing

In the future, the Bridge could enable sharing of specific files between applications or users. Because all files co-exist on a shared network, this is a problem
of standardization and identity management.
Bridge could also use a third-party source of identity, like a PGP keyserver
or Keybase[21], to enable secure person-to-person file sharing. A tiered keying
strategy (as used by LastPass[20]) could also allow for the sharing of individual
files. Other cryptographic schemes like proxy re-encryption seem promising.
For a simplified example: if file keys are strongly encrypted and escrowed with
a Bridge, files could be shared to any social media handle that could be authenticated via Keybase. Bridge could send the corresponding client a single
encrypted file key along with a transposition key, thus enabling access to a file
without exposing the file to Bridge, or modifying the file in any way.
A thorough description of these key management schemes is outside the scope
of this paper. It is enough to note that they exist, that many useful strategies
can be implemented in parallel, and that a dedicated Bridge can facilitate them
in many useful ways.

3.4

Bridge as a Network Information Repository

As noted earlier, data owners are responsible for negotiating contracts and managing file state. With enough information about peers on the network, contract
selection becomes a powerful tool for maintaining file state. A Bridge will have
many active contracts with many farmers, and will therefore have access to
information about those farmers. A Bridge could use this information to intelligently distribute shards across a set of farmers in order to achieve specific
performance goals.
For instance, via the execution of a contract, a Bridge node gathers data
about the farmers communication latency, audit success rate, audit response
latency, and availability. With minimal additional effort, the Bridge could also
gather information about the nodes available bandwidth. By gathering a large
pool of reliable data about farmers, a Bridge node can intelligently select a set of
farmers that collectively provides a probabilistic guarantee of a certain quality
22

of service.
In other words, the Bridge can leverage its knowledge about peers on the
network to tailor the service to the clients requirements. Rather than a limited
set of service tiers, a Bridge could assemble a package of contracts on the fly to
meet any service requirement. This allows the client to determine the optimal
latency, bandwidth, or location of a file, and have confidence that its goals will
be met. For instance, a streaming video application may specify a need for high
bandwidth, while archival storage needs only high availability. In a sufficiently
large network, any need could be met.
Secure distributed computation is an unsolved problem and, as such, each
Bridge server uses its accumulated knowledge of the network. The Bridge is
able to provide a probabilistic quality of service based on its knowledge the
performance and reliability of farmers that a distributed network alone cannot
provide.

3.5

Bridge as a Service

In cases where the cost of delegating trust is not excessively high, clients may
use third-party Bridges. Because Bridges do not store data and have no access
to keys, this is still a large improvement on the traditional data-center model.
Many of the features Bridge servers provide, like permissioning and intelligent
contracting, leverage considerable network effects. Data sets grow exponentially
more useful as they increse in size, indicating that there are strong economic
incentives to share infrastructure and information in a Bridge.
Applications using object stores delegate significant amounts of trust to the
storage providers. Providers may choose to operate public Bridges as a service.
Application developers then delegate trust to the Bridge, as they would to a
traditional object store, but to a lesser degree. Future updates will allow for
various distributions of responsibilities (and thus levels of trust) between clients
and Bridges. This shifts significant operational burdens from the application
developer to the service-provider. This would also allow developers to pay for
storage with standard payment mechanisms, like credit cards, rather than managing a cryptocurrency wallet. Storj Labs Inc. currently provides this service.

23

4

Future Areas of Research

Storj is a work in progress, and many features are planned for future versions.
There are relatively few examples of functional distributed systems at scale, and
many areas of research are still open.

4.1

Federated Bridges

Bridge nodes could cooperate to share data about the network in a mutually
beneficial federation. This would allow each Bridge to improve the quality of
service that it provides by improving the quality of information available.
Bridges could also, with the consent of users, cooperate to share file metadata
and pointers among themselves. This would allow a user to access their file from
any Bridge, rather than being dependent on a single Bridge. A tiered set of
fallback Bridges storing the same access information is a desirable feature, as it
hedges against downtime from a solo Bridge. Some solvable permissioning issues
may exist, but there is no reason to believe a standard format and algorithm
for syncing state across Bridges may not be developed.

4.2

Data Portability

By encouraging use of data format and access standards, Storj aims to allow
portability of data between applications. Unlike a traditional model, where
control of data is tied to the service used to access the data, data access may
be tied to individual users because Storj forms a common underlying layer.
User data can be tied to persistent cryptographic identities, and authenticated
without exposing data to third parties. Siloing data in applications is a harmful
relic of traditional models. Building cross-compatibility into the future of data
storage greatly improves user privacy and user experience.
Applications implementing these standards would be broadly compatible.
When access is tied to users rather than services, privacy and control are preserved. A user may grant access to a service that backs up their hard drive,
which places those files in Storj. The user could separately grant access to a
photo-sharing service, which could then access any photos in the backup. The
user gains seamless portability of data across many applications, and application
developers gain access to a large pool of existing users.
Permissioning in this system may be managed by a service like a Bridge, tied

24

to a web of trust identity via services like Keybase, or handled by a distributed
self-sovereign identity system. Smart contract systems, e.g. Ethereum [22] contracts, seem like a sensible long-term choice, as they can provide file permissions
based on arbitrary code execution. Some problems may exist with respect to
management of the private information required for identity and permissioning
systems, but sufficient solutions likely exist.
While this system represents a significant step up in both usability and value,
there are unmitigable security issues. Unfortunately, as in any cryptographic
system, it is impossible to revoke access to data. Applications may cache data
or forward it to third parties. Users, by definition, trust application developers
to handle their data responsibly. To mitigate these risks, Storj Labs intends
to provide incentives to developers to build free and open-source software. No
application can be completely secure, but auditable code is the best defense of
users privacy and security.
The potential advantages in terms of user experience and privacy are great,
but more research is needed. Many open questions exist with respect to permissioning mechanisms. At worst a unified backend powering interoperable
applications provides equivalent security to current data-center based models.
Storj hopes to collaborate with other forward-thinking data-driven projects to
create and advocate for these open standards.

4.3

Reputation Systems

Storj, like many distributed networks, would profit immensely from a distributed
reputation system. A reliable means of determining reputation on a distributed
system is an unsolved problem. Several approaches have been detailed, and some
implemented in practice but none have achieved consensus among researchers
or engineers. A brief review of several of these approaches follows.
One inherent downside of distributing information across a network is the
additional latency required for decisionmaking. It is difficult to say whether any
distributed reputation system can accurately assess the bandwidth, latency, or
availability of peers on a distributed network in a manner suitable to object
storage, especially as market demand for these shifts over time. Nevertheless, a
reliable distributed reputation would be an extremely useful tool for interacting
with and understanding the network.

25

4.3.1

IPFS Bitswap

IPFS presents the concept of BitSwap ledgers [23]. BitSwap ledgers are simple
local accounting of past interactions with other nodes. As IPFS and the BitSwap
protocols are primarily concerned with distribution of objects in a Kademliastyle DHT, BitSwap ledgers count bytes sent and bytes received. Rather than
attempt to reach global consensus about the reputation state of the system,
these ledgers deal only with one-to-one relationships, and do not account for
latency, bandwidth, availability, or other quality of service factors. Most of
the behavior of nodes is left to the implementer, with some discussion given to
potential exchange strategies. This implies that BitSwap ledgers scale well and
are extremely versatile.

4.3.2

Eigentrust and Eigentrust++

Eigentrust [24] attempts to generalize the ledger approach to generate global
trust values in a distributed system using a transitive-trust model. Nodes keep
and exchange trust vectors. For networks with a large majority of trustworthy
peers, the value of each local trust vector converges to a shared global trust
vector as nodes learn more about the network via information exchange.
Eigentrust++ [25] identifies several attack vectors and modifies Eigentrust to
improve performance and reliability in the presence of malicious nodes. Eigentrust++ is currently implemented in NEM [26]. Secure global convergence to a
shared trust value for each node is a key feature for any distributed reputation
system.

4.3.3

TrustDavis

TrustDavis [27] implements reputation as insurance. Nodes provide references
for other nodes in the form of insurance contracts. Nodes seeking a prospective
partner for an economic transaction also seek insurance contracts protecting
them from the actions of that partner. Reputation in this system may be
thought of as a graph, with vertices representing nodes, and directed edges
representing the monetary value that a node is willing to stake on behalf of
another. Nodes that are distant in this graph may still transact by purchasing
a set of insurance contracts that traverses these edges. TrustDavis in practice
thus encounters the same routing problem found on other distributed systems
like the Lightning Network.

26

Denominating trust in terms of monetary value is attractive for an economic
network like Storj, but the mechanics of insurance contracts in a system like this
represent an extremely difficult problem. Notably, because failures to deliver
payment propagate backwards through the insurance route, the financial burden
always falls on the node that trusted an untrustworthy node, rather than the
untrustworthy nodes.

4.3.4

Identity Maintenance Costs

Storj is exploring a reputation system that leverages public Blockchains to solve
a narrow set of identity problems [28]. This system requires nodes to spend
money directly to maintain reputation. Nodes invest in their identity over time
by making small standardized payments to their own Storj network node ID.
Because the ID is a Bitcoin address to which the node holds the private key,
these funds are fully recoupable, except for the miners fees. In this system, nodes
prefer to interact with nodes that have a long history of regular transactions.
Over time these indicate monetary investment in an identity equal to the sum
of the miners fees paid.
The payment required to participate in this system should be significantly
less than the expected return of operating a network node. If set correctly, this
recurring monetary payment for an identity bounds the size and duration of
Sybil attacks without affecting cooperative nodes. Legitimate nodes would easily recoup their identity expense, while Sybil operators would find their expenses
outstripping their returns. Unfortunately, this approach solves a relatively small
subset of identity issues on the network, and it is difficult to see how it could
be extended to other problem sets.

4.4

OFFER Loop Strategies

Many negotiation strategies can exist and interact via the OFFER loop. Full
exploration of negotiation strategies is beyond the scope of this paper, but a few
interesting areas are immediately apparent. Simple examples include price floors
and ceilings, but complex models could be built to base strategies on market
trends and the subjective value of a shard. Negotiation strategies executed by
autonomous agents are an area of (fascinating) ongoing research. Storj will be
one of the first large-scale machine-driven marketplaces. As such, improving
negotiation efficiency is critical to the long-term efficiency of the market.

Attacks

As with any distributed system, a variety of attack vectors exist. Many of these
are common to all distributed systems. Some are storage-specific, and will apply
to any distributed storage system.

5.1

Spartacus

Spartacus attacks, or identity hijacking, are possible on Kademlia. Any node
may assume the identity of another node and receive some fraction of messages
intended for that node by simply copying its Node ID. This allows for targeted
attacks against specific nodes and data. This is addressed by implementing
Node IDs as ECDSA public key hashes and requiring messages be signed. A
Spartacus attacker in this system would be unable to generate the corresponding
private key, and thus unable to sign messages and participate in the network.

5.2

Sybil

Sybil attacks involve the creation of large amounts of nodes in an attempt to disrupt network operation by hijacking or dropping messages. Kademlia, because
it relies on message redundancy and a concrete distance metric, is reasonably
resistant to Sybil attacks. A nodes neighbors in the network are selected by
Node ID from an evenly distributed pool, and most messages are sent to at
least three neighbors. If a Sybil attacker controls 50% of the network, it successfully isolates only 12.5% of honest nodes. While reliability and performance
will degrade, the network will still be functional until a large portion of the
network consists of colluding Sybil nodes.

5.2.1

Google

The Google attack, or nation-state attack, is a hypothetical variant of the Sybil
attack carried out by an entity with extreme resources. Google attacks are
hard to address, as it is difficult to predict the actions of an organization with
orders of magnitude more resources than the sum of the resources of network
participants. The only reliable defence against a Google attack is to create a
network whose resources are on the same order of magnitude as the attackers.
At that scale, any attack against the network would represent an unsustainable
commitment of resources for such an organization.

28

5.2.2

Honest Geppetto

The Honest Geppetto attack is a storage-specific variant of the Google attack.
The attacker operates a large number of puppet nodes on the network, accumulating trust and contracts over time. Once he reaches a certain threshold
he pulls the strings on each puppet to execute a hostage attack with the data
involved, or simply drops each node from the network. Again, the best defence
against this attack is to create a network of sufficient scale that this attack
is ineffective. In the meantime, this can be partially addressed by relatedness
analysis of nodes. Bayesian inference across downtime, latency and other attributes can be used to assess the likelihood that two nodes are operated by
the same organization, and data owners can and should attempt to distribute
shards across as many unrelated nodes as possible.

5.3

Eclipse

An eclipse attack attempts to isolate a node or set of node in the network graph,
by ensuring that all outbound connections reach malicious nodes. Eclipse attacks can be hard to identify, as malicious nodes can be made to function normally in most cases, only eclipsing certain important messages or information.
Storj addresses eclipse attacks by using public key hashes as Node IDs. In order
to eclipse any node in the network, the attacker must repeatedly generate key
pairs until it finds three keys whose hashes are closer to the targeted node than
its nearest non-malicious neighbor, and must defend that position against any
new nodes with closer IDs. This is, in essence, a proof-of-work problem whose
difficulty is proportional to the number of nodes in the network.
It follows that the best way to defend against eclipse attacks is to increase
the number of nodes in the network. For large networks it becomes prohibitively
expensive to perform an eclipse attack (see Section 6.2). Furthermore, any node
that suspects it has been eclipsed may trivially generate a new keypair and node
ID, thus restarting the proof-of-work challenge.

5.3.1

Tunnel Eclipse

Because tunneled connections rely on the tunnel provider, it is trivial for a tunnel provider to eclipse nodes for which it provides tunneled connections. This
attack cannot affect publicly addressable nodes, so it can be trivially defeated
with proper configuration. This attack can be mitigated by encrypting messages
intended for tunneled nodes, thus removing the malicious tunnel provider’s abil29

ity to inspect and censor incoming messages. Like a typical eclipse attack, any
node that suspects it is the victim of a tunnel eclipse can easily generate a new
Node ID, and find a new tunnel.

5.4

Hostage Bytes

The hostage byte attack is a storage-specific attack where malicious farmers
refuse to transfer shards, or portions of shards, in order to extort additional
payments from data owners. Data owners should protect themselves against
hostage byte attacks by storing shards redundantly across several nodes (see
Section 2.7). As long as the client keeps the bounds of its erasure encoding
a secret, the malicious farmer cannot know what the last byte is. Redundant
storage is not a complete solution for this attack, but addresses the vast majority
of practical applications of this attack. Defeating redundancy requires collusion
across multiple malicious nodes, which is difficult to execute in practice.

5.5

Cheating Owner

A data owner may attempt to avoid paying a farmer for data storage by refusing to verify a correct audit. In response the farmer may drop the data-owners
shard. This attack primarily poses a problem for any future distributed reputation system, as it is difficult for outside observers to verify the claims of either
party. There is no known practical publicly verifiable proof of storage, and no
known scheme for independently verifying that a privately verifiable audit was
issued or answered as claimed. This indicates that a cheating client attack is a
large unsolved problem for any reputation system.

5.6

Faithless Farmer

While the farming software is built to require authentication via signature and
token before serving download requests, it is reasonable to imagine a modification of the farming software that will provide shards to any paying requestor.
In a network dominated by faithless farmers, any third-party can aggregate and
inspect arbitrary shards present on the network.
However, even should faithless farmers dominate the network, data privacy is
not significantly compromised. Because the location of the shards that comprise
a given file is held solely by the data owner, it is prohibitively difficult to locate
a target file without compromising the owner (see Section 6.3). Storj is not
30

designed to protect against compromised data owners. In addition, should a
third-party gather all shards, strong client-side encryption protects the contents
of the file from inspection. The pointers and the encryption key may be secured
separately. In the current implementation of Bridge, the pointers and the keys
are held by the Bridge and the client, respectively.

5.7

Defeated Audit Attacks

A typical Merkle proof verification does not require the verifier to know the
depth of the tree. Instead the verifier is expected to have the data being validated. In the Storj audit tree, if the depth is unknown to the verifier the farmer
may attack the verification process by sending a Merkle proof for any hash in
the tree. This proof still generates the Merkle root, and is thus a valid proof of
some node. But, because the verifier does not hold the data used to generate
the tree, it has no way to verify that the proof is for the specific leaf that corresponds to the challenge. The verifier must store some information about the
bottom of the tree, such as the depth of the tree, the set of leaves nodes, or the
set of pre-leaves. Of these, the depth is most compact, and thus preferable.
Using the pre-leaf as an intermediary defeats another attack, where the
farmer simply guesses which leaf corresponds to the current challenge. While
this attack is unlikely to succeed, its trivially defeated by forcing the farmer to
provide the pre-leaf. The farmer cannot know the pre-leaf before the challenge
is issued. Requiring transmission of the pre-leaf also allows the data owner to
proceed through the challenge set linearly instead of being forced to select randomly. This is desireable because it allows the data owner to maintain less state
information per tree.

Selected Calculations

The following are several interesting calculations related to the operation of the
network.

6.1

Failure of k-of-n Erasure Coding

The chance of failure of k-of-n erasure coding, assuming probability p every
shard stays online, is calculated as a binomial distribution:

31

Prf ailure (n; k, p) =

k−1

prob _ fail (n ,k , p ) : return sum ([ bin (n ,i , p ) for i in range (0 , k ) ])

Therefore, with well-chosen k and n, in addition to recovery methods described above, the statistical chance of shard or file loss is quite small.

6.2

Difficulty of Eclipsing a Target Node

The probability of eclipsing a targeted node in the a network with k nodes in h

prob _ succ (h , k ) : return sum ([ bin (i ,h , k ) for i in range (3 , h ) ])

6.3

Beach Size

As the number of shards on the network grows, it becomes progressively more
difficult to locate a given file without prior knowledge of the locations of its
shards. This implies that even should all farmers become faithless, file privacy
is largely preserved.
The probability of locating a targeted file consisting of k shards by n random
draws from a network containing N shards is modeled as a hypergeometric
distribution with K = k:

6.4

Partial Audit Confidence Levels

Farmers attempting to game the system may rely on data owners to issue partial
audits. Partial audits allow false positives, where the data appears intact, but
in fact has been modified. Data owners may account for this by ascribing
confidence values to each partial audit, based on the likelihood of a false positive.
Partial audit results then update prior confidence of availability. Data owners
may adjust audit parameters to provide desired confidence levels.
The probability of a false positive on a parital audit of n bytes of an N byte
shard, with K bytes modified adversarially by the farmer is a hypergeometric
distribution with k = 0:

N −K

hyp (N ,K , n ) : return float ( choose (N -K , n ) / choose (N , n )
prob _ false _ pos (N ,K , n ) : return hyp (N ,K , n )

As demonstrated, the chance of false positives on even small partial audits
becomes vanishingly small. Farmers failing audits risk losing payouts from current contracts, as well as potential future contracts as a result of failed audits.
Dropping 10% of a shard virtually guarantees a loss greater than 10% of the contract value. Thus it stands to reason that partially deleting shards to increase
perceived storage capcity is not a viable economic strategy.

Unstoppable Data for Unstoppable Apps: DATAcoin by Streamr

First public draft
May 25th, 2017
Version 0.7
This whitepaper is for information only and does not constitute an offer or any kind of investment
advice. Any element of this whitepaper may undergo significant changes as the project further develops.

Streamr vision
Streamr delivers unstoppable data to unstoppable applications. It is the real­time data backbone
of the global supercomputer. It is a decentralized network for scalable, low­latency,
untamperable data delivery and persistence, operated by the DATAcoin token. Anyone — or
anything — can publish new data to data streams, and others can subscribe to these streams to
power Ðapps, smart contracts, microservices, and intelligent data pipelines.
To incentivize user participation in the network, there's a built­in mechanism for data
monetization. Valuable data from security exchanges, connected devices, IoT sensors, and
social media can be offered to companies, developers, and private citizens. Machines can
autonomously sell their data, get paid, and purchase the data they require. A global market for
real­time data emerges, with built­in data provenance, encryption, and access control.
Alongside the decentralized data network and marketplace, the full Streamr stack includes a
powerful analytics engine and a UI for rapid development of real­time Ðapps. Data streams,
smart contracts, and decentralized computing resources can be interconnected in a low­code
environment using high­level building blocks. Streamr will be the easiest place to create
real­time, data­driven, and trustworthy blockchain applications.
A revolution is taking place where centralized cloud services are one by one being superseded
by tokenized, decentralized solutions. Golem, for example, replaces Azure Virtual Machine, and
IPFS replaces Azure Blob Storage. Streamr is proud to join the revolution by providing a
decentralized solution to messaging and event processing, replacing platforms such as Azure
EventHub and Azure Stream Analytics.

1. Background
Real­time data will increasingly turn into a commodity in the coming years. Huge volumes of
timestamped data is being generated by sensors and connected devices in manufacturing, the
service sector, and the entire supply chain which underlies the modern economy, with much of
the data generated in a streaming fashion1,2.
The amount of data is increasing exponentially along the growth of IoT and the ubiquity of
connected devices. In the global IoT market, IHS Markit forecasts3 that the installed base will
grow from 15.4 billion devices in 2015 to 30.7 billion devices in 2020 and to 75.4 billion in 2025.
Much of the newly generated data is valuable: It can be used to optimise manufacturing
operations, track assets with increasing accuracy, target existing consumer services with high
granularity, and create entirely new services and business models.
At the same time, there is a megatrend in motion towards the next generation of the computing
stack. In a distributed future, the backend code of decentralized apps — or Ðapps4 — runs in
peer­to­peer networks. Ethereum is a Ðapp in itself, so is Golem, and there are many more in
development.
However, Ðapps do not run in isolation: They need external data to function. As it is, storage
and distribution of real­world data remain centralised, and Ðapps remain liable to all the known
problems: Concentration of power, lack of robustness, and vulnerability to cyber attacks.
To be sure, you can already store data in the blockchain. There are also decentralized file
storage apps such as IPFS, Swarm, and Storj, and databases like BigchainDB are starting to
emerge. While such solutions are surely part of the new decentralized fabric, they don't really
provide an answer to cases where real­time data is needed in any significant volumes. The
chain is not designed for high throughput or low latency, it does not scale, and storage is
expensive.
What is needed is a natively decentralized data backbone as a complement to decentralized
apps. This real­time data backbone will be the missing link, and the link that we want to help
provide. The infrastructure we create consists of a technology stack which helps connect and

incentivise computers in a global peer­to­peer (P2P) network. This is a network which provides
low­latency, robust and secure data delivery and persistency, and all at scale. Ðapps of the
future are fuelled by data, and our mission is to make sure that the data keeps on flowing.
We also create a market for real­time data. In the data market, anyone can publish events to
data streams, and anyone can subscribe to streams and use the data in decentralized apps.
Much of the data is free, but where that's not the case, the terms of use are stored in Ethereum
smart contracts. A digital token — a DATAcoin — is needed to access and operate the data
market, and to compensate nodes in the P2P network. Subscribers pay for the data with the
token, and data producers and network participants are reimbursed automatically and securely.
Our stack is built on a decentralized transport layer. Apart from greater robustness, resilience
and fault tolerance, decentralization facilitates openness, transparency, and community building.
The power over data is not with large corporations like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM.
The network consists of a multitude of data producers, data consumers, and message broker
nodes in­between. You make a reputation for yourself and earn good karma by contributing to
data exchange and by helping run the network to everyone’s benefit.
We believe that sustained growth of the blockchain community will be facilitated by having a
good usability layer in place. Tools are needed so that non­experts can create secure smart
contracts, and connect those contracts and Ðapps to reliable data sources. We will help build
the required toolkit by providing a visual editor, wrappers, and templates. In short, we want to be
the place to go for anyone who's in the business of creating data­driven decentralized services.
In the rest of this paper we describe the Streamr technology stack, define the role of the digital
token, explain the status quo, present the R&D roadmap, and introduce the team.

2. Streamr stack
The decentralized real­time data pipeline is built on top of a multi­layered technology stack:
●
●

●
●

Streamr Editor constitutes a usability layer and toolkit which enables rapid development
of decentralized, data­driven apps.
Streamr Engine is a high­performance event processing and analytics engine that
executes off­chain in a decentralized fashion. It can run on a decentralized computing
provider such as Golem.
Streamr Data Market is a universe of shared data streams which anyone can contribute
and subscribe to.
Streamr Network is the data transport layer, defining an incentivized peer­to­peer
network for messaging in the decentralized data pipeline.

●

Streamr Smart Contracts enable nodes in the Streamr network to reach consensus,
hold stream metadata, handle permissioning and integrity checking, and facilitate secure
token transfers.

The following section goes through each layer of the stack (see Figure 1) in detail, following a
top­down approach.

Figure 1. Streamr technology stack.

2.1 Streamr Editor
Streamr Editor enables rapid development of data­driven smart contracts, lowers
the threshold for Ðapp creation, and comes with ready­made templates for
common use cases built in.
There is considerable interest in the blockchain and decentralized applications within the
business community, but the number of real­life use cases remains limited. These are the early
days, and it is not unreasonable to postulate that many of those who want to get involved are
not deep experts in the minutiae of Ethereum, Solidity, encryption, data provenance, and other
technical issues.

In our view, the commercial growth of the ecosystem requires tools which allow non­experts to
set up smart contracts, connect to trusted data sources, make use of secure off­chain modules
for data filtering, aggregation, and refinement, deploy decentralized applications, track smart
contract execution, and visualise the flow of input data and blockchain events.
We address the need for a usability layer by providing powerful tools (such as an easy­to­use
visual editor), wrappers, and smart contract templates which are targeted at domain
professionals and business users. These tools hide the deep technology under the hood, handle
the data integrations and communications, and automate the routine steps in the deployment
and monitoring of smart contracts.
We foresee an ecosystem where there are several usability platforms and tools available. The
existing Streamr platform already implements some elements of the usability layer, with more
functionality being added in the coming months and years. The aim is to reach a stage where
you can build and deploy a useful and functioning data­driven smart contract in minutes. This is
more than a fantasy; our demo in EDCON5 Paris in February 2017 is a taster of what can
already be done (see Figure 2 for an illustration).

These are some of the planned features for the usability layer:

2.2 Streamr Engine
Streamr Engine is the high­performance analytics engine that executes off­chain
within a decentralized computing provider (e.g. in a Docker container on Golem).

Figure 3. Typical data flow pattern and outcomes for the Streamr analytics engine.
Ðapps, usually with web­based UIs and smart contract­based back­ends, currently have no way
to process raw data and turn it into information. A group of IoT sensors or the stock market
might produce thousands or even millions of events per second, a quantity impossible or far too
expensive to push onto any blockchain for computation.
6

A streaming analytics layer is needed to turn raw data into refined information and ready for
consumption by Ðapps and smart contracts. Raw data may need to be filtered, downsampled,
aggregated, combined with other data, run through anomaly detection algorithms, or processed
by advanced machine learning and pattern recognition models. Or you may want to do things
which simply cannot be done in smart contracts, such as calling external APIs as part of the
processing chain.
The Streamr Engine listens to events on the Streamr Network, and models built using the
Streamr Editor refine incoming data and react to new events in real time. There are many ways
to react, including the following:
●
●
●
●

Publishing refined data in another stream in the Streamr Network, perhaps shown in
real­time by a Ðapp UI also connected to the network.
Interacting with an IoT device, for example controlling an actuator, opening a lock,
turning the lights on, or calling the elevator.
Sending an alert via email or push notification.
Calling a function in a smart contract.

Using the Streamr Network as messaging glue between Ðapps and off­chain computation on
the Engine enables a whole new category of decentralized apps: apps driven by non­trivial data
volume. Obviously, the results can also be consumed by traditional centralized apps, while still
enjoying the benefits of decentralized messaging and analytics.

2.3 Data Market
Streamr data market is a global universe of shared data streams which anyone
can contribute and subscribe to. It’s a place for data monetisation and
machine­to­machine (M2M) data exchange. The data market supports anonymity,
but allows for the verification of digital identity where required.
The data market is a meeting place for data producers and data consumers. Data consumers
find value in the data offered, and wish to access it in order to use it as input for Ðapps, smart
contracts, or traditional apps.
The data is organised in data streams, the basic building block of the data market and a
primitive in the Streamr Network (see Chapter 2.4 below). Data streams contain events from
data sources that keep emitting new data points at either regular or irregular intervals. Here are
some typical settings where real­time data is produced in a streaming fashion:

7

●
●
●
●
●
●
●

A stock market generates a new event every time there is a new bid or offer, and every
time a trade takes place.
A public transport vehicle broadcasts its identity, status, speed, acceleration,
geolocation, and heading every few seconds.
A motion detector transmits a signal when a moving object is detected in its range.
IIoT sensors attached to an electrical drive measure the temperature, speed, and
vibrations during the drive operation in a smart factory.
Air quality sensors measure carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and
ozone levels in an urban area.
Seismometers measure ground motion in an area with volcanic activity.
Smart clothing worn by professional athletes collects biometric data such as the
heartbeat, temperature, and acceleration.

The data market makes a wide selection of trustworthy timestamped data available for
subscription. Some of the data is sourced from established and professional data vendors and
redistributors, and some from public, open data sources. Importantly, the platform allows anyone
to contribute and monetize their data. Whilst companies have valuable data streaming in from
sensors and devices, private citizens are producing valuable information too.
For example, people wearing a smartwatch might place their heart rate data on sale on the data
market. Data can be offered anonymously, so privacy is not violated. Who would be interested in
such data? Well, a pharmaceutical company might buy it for research, or a public healthcare
organization might use it to find out how often people do sports, or what the stress level of the
public is. A smartwatch manufacturer might buy it to get diagnostics on how their heart rate
sensors perform. And the data producers earn daily income just by making their data available.
There is no reason why subscriptions in the data market should be initiated by human software
developers, data engineers, or data scientists. In fact, the decentralized market may well end up
being dominated by machine­to­machine transactions. Autonomous machines, robots, smart
appliances will all need data in their operations, and they are producing data which is valuable
to other participants in the ecosystem.
Automatic, value­adding refinement patterns will emerge. An AI might subscribe to a raw stock
market feed, apply proprietary pattern recognition to generate trading signals, and offer those
signals for sale on the same data market.
Whilst much of the content in the data market will be freely available for all, there will be data
that needs to be paid for, and there will be data where an end user license applies. In such
cases, a subscription license is needed. A license gives the right to access the data for a
specific period of time, on certain conditions, and for a fee. There's a close analogy to streaming
music: You don't get to own the subscribed data, any more than you get to own the rights to a
song by hearing it on Spotify or by downloading it from iTunes.
8

Data licenses are implemented as smart contracts (see Section 2.5.4). The great benefit of the
blockchain is that it offers a trustless and decentralized way to store the terms of use and the
access rights, and to ensure that data payments are made as agreed.
In a wider context, there's potential for a powerful network effect in the marketplace. The more
content there is, the more attractive the proposition becomes for both data contributors and to
data consumers. In Streamr data market, a web portal (implemented as a Ðapp) facilitates the
discovery of what data exist out there, provides a comprehensive toolkit for the creation and
management of data streams, and makes it easy to subscribe to data streams of choice.

2.4 Streamr Network
Streamr Network is the data transport layer in the technology stack. It consists of
Streamr Broker nodes which establish a P2P network. The network hosts a
publish/subscribe mechanism and supports decentralized storage of events. The
network throughput scales linearly with the number of participating nodes, and it
can process millions of events per second.

Figure 4. An example of an event traveling through the broker network from a data source to a
subscriber Ðapp.
The Streamr Network (Figure 4) is a transport layer of the Streamr stack. The network handles
all messaging in the decentralized data pipeline. The layer consists of primitives (events and
streams) and broker nodes. The broker nodes operate on the primitives, and the collection of
broker nodes constitutes the P2P network which handles decentralized storage and
decentralized messaging.
9

The infrastructure layer uses the underlying Ethereum stack for its operations. Node
coordination requires robust consensus, which is implemented through smart contracts. The raw
event data itself usually doesn’t go into the blockchain, which together with partitioning allows
the Streamr Network to scale to millions of events per second and higher.
The Streamr Network combines the best parts of scalable cloud­based real­time data transports
(e.g. Kafka, ZeroMQ, ActiveMQ) and what’s available in the decentralised P2P/crypto
community (Whisper6, Bitmessage7). The cloud­based frameworks use efficient sharding and
persistence schemes to reach high throughput, but only in a trusted local network environment.
The peer­to­peer protocols showcase effective strategies for routing, peer discovery, NAT
traversal, location obfuscation, and so on, but fail to deliver the throughput needed for data
intensive real­world applications.
2.4.1 Events
An event8 is a timestamped piece of information. Every event contains headers and content.
The headers specify the metadata for the event, such as its timestamp, origin, and content type.
The event protocol supports arbitrary types and formats of content payload, e.g. JSON
messages or binary images. The content type indicates what format the content is in. Event
headers and content are encoded in a binary format for transmission.
All events on the Streamr network are cryptographically signed. All events have an origin, for
example an Ethereum address. A signature is calculated from a private key and the rest of the
message. The signature is used to prove the message origin as well as the message integrity.
Since the event format allows for any kind of origins and signatures, the system is future­proof.
The following table lists the information contained in an event.

2.4.2 Streams
All events belong to a stream. There can be any number of streams, each of which groups
together events that are logically related and stored in an ascending chronological order. Stream
metadata is stored in an Ethereum smart contract. Each stream is identified by the Ethereum
address of the contract. For scalability, events (i.e. the actual data points) are not stored in
smart contracts or in the blockchain.
A data stream holds a set of permissions. The permissions control who can read events from
the stream (subscribe), and who can write new events to the stream (publish). The stream
owner controls the permissions, but she can also grant or delegate the permission control to
third parties where needed.
The following table lists the metadata for a stream.

2.4.3 Publish/Subscribe
Data delivery in the network follows the publish/subscribe paradigm9. Events published to a
stream are promptly delivered to all authorized and connected subscribers of the stream.

9

Wikipedia: Publish/subscribe pattern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish­subscribe_pattern)
11

Subscribing to streams can be restricted to certain users only, or be free to the public. Similarly,
the permission to publish content to a stream can be held by one, many, or everyone.
The publish/subscribe paradigm enables many messaging topologies used in real­world
applications:
●
●
●
●

One­to­many (for example, a news channel or stock ticker)
Many­to­many (for example, a group chat or a multiplayer game)
One­to­one (for example, a private chat or an analytics pipeline)
Many­to­one (for example, a voting system)

Note that publishing an event need not imply that the event is delivered to any clients: It may be
the case that there are no subscribers. Still, the event is persisted and delivered to a number of
broker nodes for redundancy.
Technically, there are two types of subscribers. The majority of the data flow goes to subscribers
connected to the network via a direct connection to a broker node (see Section 2.4.4. below).
They can be, for example, web front­ends of Ðapps, event processing chains running on
Streamr Engine, or IoT devices controlled by data from the network.
Smart contracts are a special type of subscriber supported by the Streamr Network. Broker
nodes in the network are incentivized to deliver events to subscribing smart contracts. In this
scenario, of course, blockchain scalability limits apply. The mechanism allows the network to act
as an oracle, meaning that data can be pushed to smart contracts without help from a 3rd party
oracle. Since all data in the network is signed at the source, it can always be verified and
trusted.
2.4.4 Broker node
The Streamr Broker node is the core software component in the network. A broker node
handles tasks such as publishing events, subscribing to streams, handling storage, and
communicating with Ethereum nodes via JSON RPC calls. The broker node exposes its
functionality to connected applications via APIs.
The broker API can be used from apps using standard HTTP and Websocket libraries in any
language. For ease of use, we’ll provide reference implementations in a number of languages.
The primary client library platform will be written in JavaScript. It can be used to deliver data to
web­based Ðapps running in the browser as well as to back­end applications running node.js. A
Websocket API handles event delivery from data sources to the network and from the network
to client Ðapps. For stream management, a JSON API is used.
The Websocket streaming API takes care of the following tasks:
12

●
●
●
●
●

Authenticate a session
Publish events
Subscribe to events in streams
Deliver events to subscribed clients
Query historical events in streams

The JSON API exposes the following functionality:
●
●
●
●
●
●
●

Create a stream
Configure a stream
Delete a stream
Get info about a stream
Find stream(s) by search criteria
Publish events (alternative to Websocket API)
Query historical events in streams (alternative to Websocket API)

Most of the traffic between brokers consists of event messages, but there is also traffic related
to routing and peer discovery. An important coordination task between brokers is partition
assignment, in which a reliable consensus must be achieved. This mechanism is implemented
as a smart contract which leverages the power of the Ethereum network (see Section 2.4.5
below).
2.4.5 Partitioning (sharding)
Event traffic in the whole network is divided into independent parts called partitions. Each broker
node handles the traffic belonging to a set of partitions. This is how scalability is achieved: not
all nodes handle all the traffic. This is similar to the partitioning scheme found in e.g. Apache
Kafka.
The partition for a particular event is calculated by hashing the stream id. This is a fast operation
and done locally. Using the stream id as the partition key means that all events in a particular
stream always go to the same partition. This allows the network to maintain the ordering of
events within a stream, and to store them efficiently.
It may happen that a stream receives such a volume of messages that a single broker cannot
handle them. In this case, an another round of partitioning is applied to the streams themselves,
and the traffic within a stream is split to independent parts. In this case, we hash the (stream id,
stream partition) tuple to assign the network partition, and the publisher provides the partition
key which assigns the event to a partition within the stream. The order of events for a stream
partition key is preserved.
The number of partitions in the network remains constant until automatically incremented over
time. As described in the next section, there is a coordinator smart contract which controls
13

network partitioning. The number of partitions is proportional to the number of broker nodes
participating in the network.
2.4.6 Node coordination
In distributed data systems such as Apache Kafka and Apache Cassandra, node coordination is
usually achieved by using a component like Apache Zookeeper. There is a centralized process
for establishing consensus in processes like leader election. Alternatively, some systems use
manual assignment of coordinator nodes which have special privileges in the network.
In a decentralized network, such centralized or privileged components cannot exist. Instead, the
Streamr network uses the underlying Ethereum network to establish consensus for node
coordination in the P2P network.
The key coordination task is the assignment of network partitions to broker nodes in the
network, and the maintenance of changes in this information when nodes appear or disappear.
Instead of a centralized component like Zookeeper, this task is implemented by a smart
contract: the network coordinator. The network coordinator contract is deployed on the
Ethereum blockchain. Broker nodes find out the current network state by watching and querying
the smart contract. Upgrading the network is achieved simply by switching to a new network
coordinator contract.
Rebalancing the partition assignments is one of the tasks of the network coordinator contract.
Only useful changes are made, and if there are none, the function does nothing. When the
network is unbalanced, calling the function awards DATAcoin to the caller. This incentive
ensures that network rebalancing takes place when needed.
The nodes assigned to a partition receive all the data for that partition. Some or all of them
calculate rolling checksums on the data, and report the checksums to the network coordinator
smart contract at certain intervals. In a large public network, there are enough nodes for each
partition to make it difficult for them to collude. Partition assignment by the network coordinator
smart contract is also difficult to influence.
2.4.7 Incentivization
Subscribers are the consumers of data in the network. DATAcoin, the network’s usage token,
enables subscribers to subscribe to streams. Other parties gain DATAcoin by contributing to the
network: the broker nodes (the “miners” of this network), and the data publishers.
Broker nodes are incentivized to do two things: report checksums for their assigned partitions to
the network coordinator smart contract (see Section 2.4.6. above), and deliver data to any smart
contract subscribers (see Section 2.4.3). Both operations cost some Ethereum gas, paid by the
broker. This cost is covered by DATAcoin the brokers receive for making the network function.
14

Figure 5. A schematic diagram of the incentive structure in the Streamr Network.
Checksums for a partition are calculated and reported by multiple broker nodes, and the brokers
are rewarded only if the brokers agree on the checksums on a coherence threshold set in the
coordinator smart contract (for example, 90% of assigned brokers need to report a particular
checksum for it to be considered valid). If a node reports deviant checksums, none at all, or the
checksums are not coherent, no reward is obtained and offending nodes become less likely to
be assigned responsibility for a partition in the future.
As discussed, smart contracts can be subscribers to a stream. The subscriber sets a bounty in
DATAcoin for delivering events to the smart contract. The bounty is collected by whoever
delivers the data first. Usually this would be the broker node directly connected to the publisher,
as that broker is in a forerunner position to make the delivery. Other nodes or external
subscribers may watch this process and identify opportunities to deliver the data, if not delivered
by the usual suspect.
A mechanism is also needed to prevent flooding in the network. A minimal cost must be
associated with all publish operations as well as deliveries to subscribers. The network can
aggregate the costs and commit every now and then to the underlying blockchain for scalability,
similar to how state channels or micropayment channels work in some blockchain networks.
2.4.8 Event persistence
Events in data streams are persisted in the peer­to­peer network. This effectively turns the
network into a decentralized time series database. The decentralization brings in a number of
15

advantages, including greater robustness, fault tolerance, lower cost, and the potential for
anonymity.
With streams being sequences of events, the simplest form of storage is an event log. An event
log can be stored in any block storage, such as a file system on the nodes themselves, or
decentralised object storage such as Swarm10, IFPS11 or Storj12.
For storage with much more granularity and querying features, decentralized databases such as
BigchainDB13 are emerging. A solution like this is a likely candidate for event storage in the
Streamr Network. However the landscape is changing rapidly, and we won’t commit to a specific
storage solution at this time.
2.4.9 Data provenance
Security and data provenance are critical issues whenever external data is used as inputs to
Ðapps and smart contracts. As blockchain transactions are irrevocable, there's a clear incentive
for honest parties to ensure that the inputs are trustworthy. There is also an incentive for
dishonest parties — as well as unscrupulous hackers — to manipulate the data for monetary
benefit.
In the Streamr network, every data point is cryptographically signed by a private key owned by
the data origin. The area is undergoing rapid development, and many different methods are
possible. Events could be signed with, for example, an Ethereum private key, X.509 certificate
owned by an IoT sensor, trusted hardware enclaves using the Intel SGX chip and the Town
Crier14 relay, or a TLSNotary15 service bridging data from a web API.
By design, the Streamr network is unopinionated on the method used to attest the data
provenance, and it can indeed support any method available now or in the future. Events on the
network always carry both the signature itself as well as information on which method to use to
verify the signature. The client libraries which publish and subscribe to events can incrementally
add support for different methods, abstracting away the inner workings of each method and
making signature verification easy from a developer's point of view.

The initially supported signature algorithm is the same secp256k1 ECDSA as is used by
Ethereum. This conveniently allows the network to reliably map any published data to an
Ethereum address.
2.4.10 Data confidentiality
Given that anyone can participate in the Streamr network by running a broker node, event
payloads of non­public streams in the Streamr network are strongly encrypted using asymmetric
key cryptography. Only parties holding an authorized private key can read the data. The stream
smart contracts hold the public keys of whoever is allowed to access the stream. At the time of
publishing, the public keys of authorized recipients are used to encrypt the data so that only the
authorized recipients can access the data.
Multicast encryption16,17 techniques may be used to balance message size with keying
complexity. Built­in encryption support also allows for straight­forward data monetization, as
services such as the Streamr Data Market can be created to sell or rent access to stream
contents. Publishers can rekey the data stream to selectively deny access e.g. in case they
catch subscribers reselling their data outside the network.
A decentralized approach combined with encryption brings safety: The data is fragmented to a
number of unknown physical locations, and it is protected by strong encryption while in transit
and in storage. The design addresses the fears of companies and organisations that are
concerned about the potential for compromised data via physical access to data centers and
storage facilities.

2.5 Streamr Smart Contracts
A number of Ethereum smart contracts support the operation of the Streamr
Network and the Data Market. The Streamr Network uses smart contracts for
incentivization, coordination, permissioning, and integrity checking. The Data
Market builds upon features provided by the Network for data licensing and
monetization. DATAcoin, an ERC20 token, is used by both layers for
incentivization, as a reputation metric, and as the means of payment.

2.5.1 Stream
The stream smart contract holds information about a stream (see Section 2.4.2). Besides
holding static information, it carries the permissions for the stream. In particular, it carries the
public keys of authorized recipients for encrypted streams, possibly tied to a data license (see
below).
2.5.2 Stream registry
The stream registry contract holds information about known streams in the network. Streams
can be added to the registry for lookup purposes. The stream registry can also register streams
on ENS (Ethereum name service).
2.5.3 Network coordinator
The network coordinator contract assigns partitions to broker nodes (see Section 2.4.6).
Broker nodes register themselves with the coordinator and receive updates on the network state
by watching the smart contract.
2.5.4 Data license
The data license contract represents a product listed in the Streamr Data Market. In return for
DATAcoin, the contract grants access to an associated set of streams by registering the
purchaser’s public key with the streams. The data license can be valid for a certain period. After
the license expires the buyer will no longer have access to new data published on the stream(s).
The raison d'être of a license contract is to hold the proof that the recipient has the right to
access a data stream on specific and immutable terms of use, and to simultaneously guarantee
that the data provider receives the agreed payment for real­time data as and when it is
published. The terms of use may be stored in the data license contract either directly (and
hashed as needed) or as a link to content­addressed storage such as IPFS. The contract may
also contain proof about fulfilled legal requirements such as the result of a know­your­customer
(KYC) process.
Broker nodes report event counts and rolling hashes to stream smart contracts, which in turn
can report them to the associated license contract. The license smart contracts can implement
almost arbitrary safeguards to prevent publisher fraud. They may, for example, lock the payment
until a certain amount of events have been published on the stream. The payment could also be
made incrementally over time or event­by­event as they are published. There may also be a
mechanism for subscribers to flag bad data, negatively affecting the publisher’s reputation (see
Section 3 on DATAcoin and karma). These safety features ensure that the publisher cannot get
paid without delivering quality data as promised.
18

3. DATAcoin
DATAcoin is the means of compensation between data producers and consumers.
It is also an incentive for running broker nodes in the P2P network. DATAcoin is
the basis for karma, the reputation metric in the community. In a bigger picture, it
is a way to gain exposure to data as a valuable commodity.

Figure 6. DATAcoin flows in the opposite direction from the data.
There’s an integral role for a digital token in the decentralized data pipeline. DATAcoin is the
usage token of the Streamr network. DATA is the symbol of the token.
●

●

●

Maintaining and operating a P2P network takes resources: time, electricity, computing
power, and communication bandwidth. Incentivization of the participating broker nodes
are described in section 2.4.7.
DATAcoin is the means of compensation between producers and consumers. In other
words, it implements a monetization mechanism for data producers. This is an incentive
for data vendors to step in and help grow the community to everyone's benefit.
DATAcoin is the basis for karma, the reputation metric in the community of data
producers, data consumers, and message brokers. Parties gain karma from DATAcoin
transactions: Publishing data, consuming data, and running broker nodes that operate
the network. A data producer gains karma when events she published are delivered to
subscribers. Subscribers earn karma by receiving events. Broker nodes earn karma for
helping with data delivery and persistence. Bookkeeping is easy: The amount of new

19

karma equals the amount of DATAcoin exchanged. The difference is that karma decays
and eventually expires, while the token balance does not.
DATAcoin is implemented as an ERC20 token on Ethereum. The token smart contract maintains
DATAcoin balances, and ensures that payments are handled in a trustless and secure way.
Following the ERC20 standard ensures interoperability with wallets and other tokens.
DATAcoin will be created in a token generating event (TGE) currently scheduled for Q3/2017. Its
details, terms and conditions, and detailed schedule will be announced later.

4. Current state
There’s a highly advanced platform already in place for creating data pipelines,
visualisations, and off­chain computing microservices. The platform provides a
functional starting point, but to reach full decentralization it must be refitted to run
in a decentralized container and use the new Streamr Network layer for message
transport.
We do not start from scratch. There’s a functional and highly advanced platform in place for
creating data pipelines, visualisations, off­chain processing, and Ethereum smart contracts. The
software is built for the cloud environment with scalability, integrations, and fault tolerance in
mind. Big data frameworks like Kafka and Cassandra are used for data handling and
messaging. The Streamr platform was demonstrated live in EDCON in February 2017.
As to the pedigree, we created the first version of the software for our own use in algorithmic
high­frequency trading soon 5 years ago. The principals all come from a financial background,
being either quants, trading system developers, stat arb traders, and in some cases all of the
above. Quantitative finance is a field where automatic processing of high volumes of real­time
data has been the reality for the past 10­15 years and more. It is only the past few years where
the same kind of modus operandi and the same kind of tools and platforms are finding their way
into the world of IoT, IoE, and now into the blockchain space.
The current platform is functional, scalable, and in live use by corporate customers. Most of the
components do not, however, translate directly to the new world. Storage needs to be
decentralized, messaging, pub/sub functionality, and data monetization and encryption built into
the transport layer, and the peer­to­peer network established along with node coordination and
incentivization. The roadmap of how to do these things is presented in the next section.

20

5. Roadmap

Figure 7. R&D roadmap for the Streamr project.
The roadmap (Figure 7) is divided in three milestones (M1­M3). Each milestone iteratively
brings new features into layers of the stack. Each of the three milestones consists of work
packages (WP1­WP9). Completing all WPs in a milestone completes the milestone. Each work
package has a specific focus on certain layers in the stack. All WPs in a milestone will be
worked on roughly simultaneously, but WPs in the next milestone will not begin before the
current milestone is complete.
We have chosen the iterative full­stack approach on the following reasoning:
●
●
●

We can provide something that’s working and usable to the community from day one.
We are starting with an existing technology stack. The stack is modular so that any
layers can be upgraded at any point along the road.
Tangible and useful deliverables will be achieved regardless of which milestones we
reach. The community won’t be left high and dry with a half­way solution; there will be
functional technology that fulfils many business use cases.

7. Conclusion
This whitepaper outlines our vision for a robust, natively decentralized real­time data backbone
for decentralized apps. We believe that the combination of a real­time data market and the data
pipeline will be transformative for Ethereum smart contract developers and the Ðapp ecosystem
at large. Our ambition is to build a well thought­out and professionally implemented technology
stack that serves the future needs of our audience, and provides unstoppable data for
unstoppable apps.
Our technology stack is layered and modular, and it is built on a decentralized transport layer.
There is a peer­to­peer network consisting of incentivized broker nodes. The network hosts a
publish/subscribe mechanism and supports decentralized storage of encrypted events.
Throughput scales linearly with the number of participating nodes, and the network can process
millions of events per second.
The data backbone is an ideal facilitator of the M2M economy, where autonomous machines,
bots, and robots buy or sell tiny pieces of data. The idea18 has been raised that machines will
barter resources such as storage, processing capacity, communication bandwidth, etc. We
believe that using DATAcoin leads to much lower transaction costs than bartering.
Streamr is part of the computing revolution where monolithic solutions are being superseded by
decentralized computing alternatives. In distributed computing, Golem replaces Azure Virtual
Machines. In block storage, IPFS, Storj, and others replace Azure Blob Storage. In data pipeline
and messaging, Streamr replaces centralized messaging and event processing platforms such
as Azure EventHub and Azure Stream Analytics. There’s a power transfer taking place from
corporations and enterprises to individual citizens, autonomous agents, apps, and machines,
leading to improved privacy, efficiency, resilience, and fault tolerance, and ultimately higher
welfare for the good denizens of the connected society.

SOMETHING
TO THINK
ABOUT
The Earth is 4.6 billion years old. Let’s
scale that down to 46 years. We’ve
been here for 4 hours. Our industrial
revolution began 1 minute ago. In that
time we’ve destroyed more than 50% of
the world’s rain forests. (Greenpeace)
This isn’t sustainable.
Let us make a difference.
We believe sustainability isn’t just a
trend. It should not be a job left to
the next generation. We see it as our
mission. Now and in the future.

ABSTRACT
SunContract disrupts the energy sector with a new business model,
supported by the blockchain technology. Blockchain takes over the role
of the middle man as a technology infrastructure, which can be trusted
by default since any and all transactions on the blockchain are peerto-peer reviewable. SunContract is a platform that directly connects
electricity producers and consumers into an electricity pool based on
smart contracts, which is a new, exciting and positive approach toward
peer to peer electricity trading.
SunContract’s vision is to support a global self-sufficient energy community based on renewable energy and peer-to-peer energy trading based
on the blockchain and smart contracts. By creating such an ecosystem,
SunContract would like to contribute to greater independence when it
comes to energy.

INTRODUCTION
SunContract is a project that connects three areas with enormous potential: electricity, blockchain and people. Growth and development in each
of these fields is important for the quality of our lives. But joined together
into a new, disruptive model of energy trading, they have the power to
make our planet a better place to live in. Supporting SunContract means
supporting sustainability because it brings together energy producers
and consumers with common interests: to save money and to create a
decentralized, smart and clean future.

Electricity is one of the cornerstones for a modern society to function.
Households, hospitals, air traffic systems, road infrastructures, communication and financial service industries are all dependent on electricity.
The renewable energy market is developing fast, due to increasing energy
demands and greater awareness of climate changes. This consequently
opens new and interesting opportunities. Research by Bloomberg New
Energy Finance (1) shows that by 2040 more than 60% of total investment
into the energy sector will go into renewables, which means that the total
global investment will be $11.4 trillion of which $7.8 trillion will go into
renewable energies and only $3.2 trillion into fossil fuel energy. This is
a significant increase of investments into the renewable energy sector,
especially into wind and solar power energy; the latter two, according to
Bloomberg, amount to more than 65% of total investment into renewables.

In its current state, the energy market is facing challenges in the form of
centralized conventional power stations that often require high costs of
energy transmission over long distances. The existing electricity model
with its infrastructure will not be able to cope with the increasing electricity demand that is expected to more than double by 2050. A change
of the model is necessary with a shift to decentralized energy production
supported by renewable energy. There has already been some movement

5

towards renewable and sustainable distributed energy systems in recent years. Let’s look at an example from the USA and the research done
by Rocky Mountain Institute. Projections in figure 1 show that in 2015
roughly 15% of the total power generated in the USA was from wind and
solar power. By 2050, it is expected to be around 71% and if you add other
renewable energy sources like hydro, geothermal power and biomass it
could go as high as 80%.

Renewable energy obtained mostly from hydro, wind and solar power will
definitely help pave the way to a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.

Figure 2 shows the price and efficiency of solar panels. It is clear that
over the past few years the cost of solar energy systems has dropped
significantly, giving easier access to affordable, clean energy. With renewable resources, energy production became more decentralized, local
and moved closer to consumption points. A distributed energy system
generates power on-site, at the point of consumption and therefore significantly decreases the cost, complexity, interdependencies and inefficiencies associated with transmission and distribution.

Blockchain technology offers great potential too. It fits perfectly into the
renewable energy sector because it enables direct (peer-to-peer) services
closer to consumers and producers and offers transparency and local
energy self-sustainability. We offer you the opportunity to be a part of
SunContract. With this project we could build the largest electrical power
pool that will enable energy self-sufficient entities and financial benefits
by combining the best features of two seemingly very different, areas.
Using the advantages of blockchain technology to disrupt services in
the energy sector is an innovative and thrilling prospect.

SUNCONTRACT IS DEDICATED TO:
• Create a digitally-tradable crypto-token for energy trading;
• Enable personal contribution for improving the global situation;
• Support self-consumption and self-sufficiency;
• Take the full potential of local renewable resources;
• Take advantage of blockchain technologies;
• Enable transparent transactions between producers and consumers
through the Pool, based on smart-contracts;
• Lowering costs by reducing or outright eliminating the role of the
middleman;
• Strengthen the cryptocurrency network;
• Connect people worldwide, borderless;
• Take an important step towards reducing global warming.

SunContract project aims to create a sun-driven economy. Our team has
remarkable ideas on how to integrate blockchain technology into the
energy sector, improve services and increase economic, environmental
and social benefits. The funds we gather will allow us to develop and
implement a variety of innovations that we are planning for this sector
in the near future. This is a truly big opportunity in the energy market
with the potential to reward all participants; the consumer with lower
costs and cleaner energy, producers with better compensation for the
electricity they produce and SunContract by the growth of the network.

8

OPPORTUNITY
Our team has been active both on energy and IT markets for years. We
are well aware of opportunities and have the knowledge and innovative
ideas for new perspective services that can be implemented with blockchain technology.

With economic growth and development the need for electricity also increases. An estimation presented during the Event Horizon 2017 in Vienna
(Energy Blockchain Conference) predicted that in 30 years the existing
levels of energy will only suffice to maintain the existing infrastructure,
given the population growth and the fact that more and more products
use electricity as their primary source. And when energy storage and the
automobile industry reach the break-through point, electricity consumption is expected to double. Figure 3 shows the increasing demand for
electric vehicles, which will be a significant factor in increased demand.

There is no question about demand: it is huge. Over and above that, there
is the gap between retail price and bulk price of electricity to consider
as well. On average, only one third of the retail electricity price is on the
energy itself, the rest are different charges that increase your bill, such
as; distribution charge, customer charge, state tax adjustment charge,

consumer education charge and some others. Introducing blockchain
into the energy market means reducing costs by diminishing the effect
and cost of the middleman. It also means optimizing consumption and
production of electricity and thus transferring the added-value directly
to consumers and producers.

The goal of SunContract is to replace the existing middleman role with
blockchain technology in order to connect independent power producers
(supply) and power consumers (demand) through the SunContract Pool
via smart contracts. Smart contracts are blockchain-based programs
that aim to provide trust and security superior to traditional contract law
and to reduce other transaction costs associated with contracting while
also saving a lot of time, since they are executed as soon as agreed by
all participants. When connecting the energy sector and cryptographic
infrastructure, a lot of room is opened up for business process optimisation, as well as more transparent and efficient functioning within
the energy sector. With this new approach, the retail price of electricity
can be diminished and that gives us an opportunity to reach a sizeable
market share.

10

THE VISION
Our primary objective and long term goal is energy peer to peer trading
(P2P). But in order to achieve that level in energetics, a few other implications need to be addressed, starting with the SunContract Energy Pool.
How the energy sector and blockchain technology fit together perfectly
can be seen through the following analysis:

COMBINING 5 T’S AND 5 D’S
The five T’s represent the fundamental features of blockchain that are
crucial for implementation on the energy market:

TRUST
TRANSPARE NC Y
TRACEABILITY

D IG IT AL IZ AT ION
D E C ARBON IZ AT ION
D E RE G U L AT ION

TIME STAM P

D E C E N T R AL IZ AT ION

TRA NS A CTION

D E M OC RAT IZ AT ION

TRUST
With blockchain technology there is no need for a trusted 3rd party to
oversee energy transactions or any other services. Rules are autonomously proposed and communicated. The use of smart contracts enables all
included parties to trust the technology and not rely on each other. This
removes uncertainty and improves the service.
TRANSPARENCY
All transactions are public and once on the blockchain cannot be altered
in any way. This ensures a healthy business environment for all participants, for energy producers and consumers alike.
11

TRACEABILITY
Every transaction written on the blockchain can be traced back to the
address from which it was executed. The identity of the users is never in
jeopardy as it is only possible to trace the address and not the person
behind it.
TIME STAMP
Blockchain also puts a time stamp on every transaction which means that
you can at any time check the exact moment of transaction execution.
TRANSACTION
Transactions made through blockchain are trustworthy, transparent,
traceable and time stamped, which makes them better, cheaper and
generally more efficient than existing ones.

The five D’s represent the features of renewable solar energy that can be
achieved with the blockchain technology:
DIGITIZATION
With digitalization of electricity trading on the blockchain it becomes
more flexible, transparent and traceable.
DECARBONIZATION
The rate of decarbonization needs to be accelerated in order to achieve
the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target set by the U.S. and Europe
at 80% by 2050 (5) and in order to achieve this goal we need to increase
the utilization of renewables.
DEREGULATION
The energy industry does not yet provide a level playing field. Conventional
energy is subsidized in many markets and consumer segments. A conducive policy framework is a prerequisite for clean energy. Government
energy policies should foster innovation as well as investment in utility-scale technologies to phase out carbon-intensive production facilities.
The potential of solar and other renewables can only be realized with regulatory support in the direction of renewable energy and self-sustainability.
DECENTRALIZATION
Decentralization is the process of redistributing or dispersing functions,
powers, people or things away from a central location or authority. In
energy sector this definition fits perfectly and gives back power to the
people-literally and figuratively, by enabling each and everybody to make

12

a change for and by themselves.
DEMOCRATIZATION
Democratization of energy supply facilitates access to power as well as
flexibility to choose the source of power. Distributed generation of electrical energy is an efficient mechanism to democratize supply across
markets.

SunContract’s disruptive model joins together the best features of blockchain technology (5 T’s) and renewable energy (5 D’s) to create an entirely
new service that will revolutionize the existing market! If we are to reach
a P2P level of energy trading, we need to establish the platform that represents the basis. This is why our focus is directed at the SunContract
Energy Pool, which is the first and most important step towards our
long term goal. Here we present independent solar power producers an
opportunity to join SunContract Energy Pool and provide clean energy
to power consumers that are connected to the Pool.

13

HOW DOES IT
WORK?
We will start by developing new services which will optimise energy trading.

Firstly, we will establish the SunContract Energy pool. The idea is to join
together electrical power producers and consumers and enable them to
trade electricity through the Pool. After successful registration everybody
can join the Pool. But in order to actually trade electricity one would need
to obtain SunContract tokens (SNC). SNC’s will be issued at the SunContract token sale as a software and energy licence to use the Energy Pool.

14

This is a simplified example of how SunContract Energy Pool could work:

CONSUMER
First of all, registration through the mobile app is necessary to enter the
Pool. Registration will be fast and easy and will enable quick and simple
smart contract signing. This is all the consumer needs to do in order to
start buying electricity from the Pool. If person A already has SNC from
their participation in the ICO, he or she can simply use them to obtain
electricity from the Pool. Other users will have to buy SNC on the exchange
in order to buy electricity from the Pool. The app will allow this transformation automatically. Due to huge potential of electricity demand
worldwide and competitive electricity price in the Pool, the demand for
coins will grow constantly and with it also their value.

PRODUCER
Person B has a solar power plant and he is a producer of clean renewable
energy. He is currently selling his electricity to huge trading companies,
where his position to negotiate is weaker. By joining the Pool, he could
get better compensation for his energy. He receives tokens, which can
then be traded on the exchange to get fiat currencies. The app will have
an option to automatically transform tokens to Euro, Dollars or any other
currencies to minimize the producer’s risk.

A crucial aspect in developing a Suncontract Energy Pool is a mobile app.
SunContract is already developing an app in order to make it user friendly
and simple. In order to be a part of the Pool you have to register through
this app. Once the registration is complete you join the SunContract
community and can immediately enjoy all the benefits offered, being a
power producer, consumer or both (prosumer).

15

SUNCONTRACT
TOKENS (SNC)
By participating in the token sale you will receive SNC tokens. As the only
crypto currency we accept on the token sale is Ether, we decided to fix the
amount of SNCs to the Ethers we gather. The basis for token issuance is
set at a ratio of 10,000 SNCs per 1 ETH.
How many tokens you get depends on the timing of your participation.

16

BOUNTY
The share of the tokens for each bounty participant will be as big as his
or her contribution. The more effort one puts into promoting SunContract,
the bigger the reward. A bounty will be distributed for different participation methods, such as:
• signature campaign participants at Bitcointalk.org
• following and promoting SunContract Twitter account
• publishing and posting SunContract on blogs
• topic translating.

EARLY BIRD BONUS
We decided to reward early participants. The sooner you join, the greater
the bonus that will be appointed to you. We will use the following schedule:
• pre-sale; 11,600 SNCs for 1 ETH
• week 1; 11,500 SNCs for 1 ETH
• week 2; 11,000 SNCs for 1 ETH
• week 3; 10,500 SNCs for 1 ETH
• week 4; 10,000 SNCs for 1 ETH

The price of one SNC will initially be determined in accordance with the
amount of funds raised through the token sale. After the token sale is
concluded, SNC will also be available on the cryptocurrency exchanges,
where the price will be determined according to market mechanisms.

SunContract will issue as many SNC’s as needed to cover all of the ETHs
gathered at the token sale (the cap is set at 100,000 ETH). This amount
of tokens will then represent the base for issuing additional tokens for
team members, bounties and referrals. 80% of the total SNC’s number
will be held by token sale participants, the rest (20%) will be appointed
to the team of developers, advisers, escrows, bounties and other costs
of token sale execution. We offer a boost to the amount of your tokens
through participation in the Bounty or Referral scheme. No new tokens
will be created after the token distribution is finished.

1. The process of Token Sale will start according to the project start
strategy.
2. During the crowdfunding process, a link will be posted on our SunContract webpage. We will have full transparency regarding the amount
and type of funds we gather on our "scale of gathered funds".
3. No later than 30 days after the conclusion of the token sale, our
SNC tokens will be distributed to token sale participants, which includesSNC tokens as a reward. If the token sale fails to reach our
minimum threshold, all funds will be reimbursed.

ROADMAP
SUNCONTRACT P2P PLATFORM
Based on a phased approach, the SunContract P2P Platform will connect
energy producers and consumers. Users will be able to trade electricity
directly; the final price and quantity will be determined by trading algorithms based on auction clearings on the Blockchain. The producer
and consumer will determine the bid and the asking price of electricity,
at which they would be willing to sell or buy, and trading algorithm and
smart contracts will do the matching and settlement. The minimum and
maximum prices of electricity will be determined by the contracts for
electricity sold and bought outside the pool.
During phase one, the SunContract Platform will be developed for direct selling, purchasing and balancing responsibilities. Later, additional
functionalities will be added and upgraded to the SunContract Platform
in order to cover ambitious objectives such as operating the flexibility
market, or assets visualization across the value chain (substations, lines,
EV chargers or electrification of heating).
IMPLEMENTING THE P2P PLATFORM ON A NATIONAL LEVEL
Rules for trading, purchasing and supplying, contract signing, invoice
issuing differ from country to country. Therefore, a business process
with a user friendly interface that is compatible with national regulatory
framework will have to be accomplished.

19

COMMERCIALIZING THE P2P PLATFORM
Once the successful implementation in Slovenia is completed, our ambition is to export the country model feature, customized for the adopting
country.
The SunContract P2P Platform aims to offer attractive services and products in the context of P2P availability and future requirements. For this
stage a new level of features for the platform will be integrated, offering
end-users the options to easily engage into the flexibility market.
A decentralized energy market requires energy producers, consumers and
load balancing. Using advancements on smart-grids, end-user customers
of the SunContract Platform will also aid the balancing of the electricity
grid through demand response. For example, the agreements regarding
the time frame for charging your electric car, the grid operator thus has
more flexibility to manage and regulate electricity flow. And for these
services they could get compensation from grid operator.
INCREASING THE TRADING VOLUME OF P2P PLATFORM
WITH RENEWABLES AND ENERGY STORAGE
Investments into renewables and energy storage could increase self-sufficiency and flexibility of the SunContract ecosystem and increase the
trading volume inside the SunContract Pool. Platform users could by
themselves ensure the storage of excess electricity during low demand
and the option to release it as demand rises.
INCREASING THE MARKET SHARE
At this stage, the platform will be fully established and our ambition is
to engage with new partners across the value chain, from academia to
transnational grid operators. We would like them to use a robust business model while contributing to a broader use of the Blockchain within
the energy market.

20

FURTHER SE RVICES DEVELOPMENT
We envision the Blockchain enabling a trusted environment for Grid
management with assets management, dynamic monitoring, coordination of loads, micro-grid management, smart substation automation
and metering management all having a role to play. The SunContract
platform, through the Pool of actual partners and acting as an aggregate
of distributed producers and consumers, could enter into such services
for providing grid capacity operation.

Short description
Suretly is a provider of an international crowd
vouching platform. The company offers users an
investment alternative called crowd vouching, which
allows customers to make money vouching for
people who need a urgent loan. This system works
in a similar fashion than peer-2-peer lending, but
customers do not lend money to each other directly.
Instead, they vouch for borrowers who apply for a
loan through lending partners. Customers can find
borrowers that are looking for their loan’s guarantors.
The voucher can check the borrower’s profile and choose whether to
vouch for the borrower if one's default risk and earning amount suit
them.

Introduction
The idea of peer-to-peer lending (P2P) was just perfect, and it seemed people
could finally lend money to others without clumsy and costly financial institutions
involved as intermediaries. P2P platforms, however, were not able to successfully
deal with regulatory pressure, and had to give up the idea of direct-user
interactions. In 2008, the SEC forced the largest market players to go public with
their securities, and this has led to a situation where investors were no longer
financing borrowers directly. Instead, they had to buy medium-term bonds
backed by loan repayment notes.
How to remedy this situation? Enter crowdvouching, which allows you to make a
profit immediately, and you will only have to put money out later if the loan is not
repaid.

What is crowdvouching?
Crowdvouching is the practice of financially securing a
loan repayment by vouching monetary contributions
from a large number of people.
Unlike P2P lending, Vouchers do not lend money
directly to the Borrowers but guarantee to repay the
loan to the Lender in case of Borrower's default.

Vouchers act as a collective mind in order to determine whether to approve loans
or not. Liability for each loan is divided among all Vouchers. Each Voucher
approval serves like an insurance of the loan capped at $10 USD. Since the
vouching range is between $2 and $10, each Borrower needs to find dozens of
Vouchers provided by Suretly platform. In order for the loan to be approved, the
entire loan amount should be guaranteed by the Vouchers.

4

Crowdvouching benefits
No cost for investors. The major difference between crowd-vouching and P2Pborrowing is that investors or co-signers on crowd-vouching platforms do not loan
any money to anyone. They do not buy securities either. What they do is act as
dozens of co-signers, who guarantee to pay part of the borrower's debt in the
event of a default. At the same time, investors receive compensation, depending
on a borrower's credit rating.
Distribution of risks. As in P2P-lending, investors co-sign only for a portion, but
not the whole amount of a loan. Each borrower should get several dozens of cosigners. Only in this case is he guaranteed to get a loan. At the moment, crowdvouching technology is tested on short-term loans (up to 30 days), which are
more profitable for investors, but assume a higher level of risk. However, the risk
is distributed between several investors.
Quick return on investment. Compensation to investors in most cases is paid
out of the loan amount. They can receive their profit the day after a loan is issued
to its borrower.
No costs are paid by investors. A licensed financial institution (bank or another
organization that is authorized to issue loans) acts as a direct lender. The crowdvouching platform is, in fact, the marketplace. Acting as an interactions
administrator for all parties involved, it assumes 100% liability to recover money
from investors in the event of the main borrower defaulting.
Lower borrowing rates. Minimizing risk lightens investors’ needs to incorporate
higher interest rates to cover potential defaults and expenses working with
problem borrowers. The rates will be minimal for borrowers. Yes, you will have to
cover the costs for investors’ compensation. But, for borrowers with high credit
ratings, these costs are going to be insignificant.

5

Anonymity. A borrower’s personal data is not disclosed to investors – they have
to make their decisions solely on the basis of profit/risk ratio evaluation. Data
remains undisclosed even in the case of a default. Situations where an angry
investor can start procedures for independent recovery of money lost, are
practically excluded.

Good opportunity to improve credit history. People with less than perfect
credit history, so-called sub-prime borrowers, are worthy of separate
consideration. According to CFSI, 121 million Americans, which count as almost
half of country's population, have a FICO score of less than 600 points. This
means, that they are locked out of access to traditional bank loans. Where else
can these people borrow any money? A borrower's card, with a minimal set of
data about them (photo, name, city, and age) is disclosed to potential investors
for decision-making purposes. It is presented, along with data on a percentage of
people with similar credit ratings, who have repaid their loans in full.
Low default rate. Collective responsibility can affect the default rate, even in
groups of people who don’t know each other. As demonstrated over 4-months
from crowd-vouching test results in Eastern Europe, the default rate is
significantly lower than in other credit products.

Crowdvouching in micro-financing
Crowd-vouching can be used for any type of loans or credits. But briefly we’re
focusing on small, short-term loans market (including payday loans). It allows us
to offer bigger rewards to investors with a higher risk level.
Besides, the micro-financing market is one of the largest among loan markets.
US residents alone spend more than $40 million annually on short-term loan
interest payments, according to CFSI. Demand for such loans in developing
countries is even higher.

Suretly charges 3% commission on each approved loan, regardless of whether
the loan is repaid by its main borrower or not.
This project has great scaling potential. The only thing necessary for its growth is
a larger number of new partner-creditors and users-investors.

Suretly UI
As was already mentioned above,
crowdvouching can be used for any type of
loans or credits. But, at the moment, our

Tinder-like user interface

team is focused on working with microfinancing companies. Among other things it
allows us to use Tinder’s mechanics, in
which investors are presented with cards of
borrowers’ information (photo, city, age, and
sex), the remuneration amount, and the
statistical probability of the loan repayment.
If an investor is comfortable with the reward/
risk ratio, he makes a swipe to the right,
guaranteeing this borrower a small amount.
If not, he moves cards to the left and goes
on to the next borrower.
Each voucher approval serves as an insurance of the loan capped at $10 USD

Beta-testing results
We’ve already tested our business model in Eastern Europe - first crowdvouched loan was issued 5 months ago, and statistics shows that 76% of our
customers earned a good profit.

8

Current project’s status
Presently, the application is working in a beta in Russia. Integration with new
creditors from Russia and Kazakhstan will be completed in a few months. Also,
technical and legal work for entering the US market is in progress.
All money raised from the ICO will be used for a fully functional application
development and for penetration into new countries’ markets.

Crossing borders
One of crowdvouching technology’s advantages is that it is global. Any investor
can work with any transaction in any country where Suretly is present.
In March 2017, crowdvouching technology was presented at LendIt-2017, the
world’s largest loan technologies exhibition. Lenders from the USA, Mexico,
India, Europe, and Africa showed interest in this technology.

ICO
Date of ICO start: July, 11 2017
Date of ICO end: August, 11 2017
Investor dashboard: https://secure.suretly.com
Suretly is planning to raise between $1.5 - $10 million USD in the next round of
financing by selling 15% of its shares. This money will help to accelerate
penetration into new markets and countries.
A main investor of this round will become a Singapore company “SURcoin
pte.ltd” which will get options to buy 15% of Suretly’s shares and will initiate
tokens issue. SURcoin pte. Ltd will issue SUR-tokens which will be offered for a
crowdsale to all willing parties in exchange for different cryptocurrencies: Ether,
BTC, LTC and Waves.
The initial exchange rate for 1 SUR token will be 0.1ETH or equivalent in
bitcoin, litecoin or waves.
All investors, who will purchase SUR-tokens during first hour after the ICO start
will receive 70% bonus, it means that each ETH token will be exchanged for 17
SUR tokens. After that, all investors who will purchase SUR-tokens next 23 hours
will receive 50% bonus. In the future, the bonus will decrease in a linearly
progression every day, until it reaches zero.
The creation of new tokens will stop after an equivalent of $10 million USD is
raised or after the ICO expiration date.
If the campaign is successful, an additional 10% will be issued to the option pool
for rewarding current and future employees. These tokens cannot be sold for the
next 12 month period. Also, we plan to issue a 2% bounty will be issued for
rewarding people who help us with marketing campaign.
No new tokens will be created after ICO.
All funds raised via ICO will be exchanged for 15% of Suretly, Inc.’s shares.

13

There will be two types of tokens available based on Ethereum and Waves. Each
investor will consider himself which type of token he wants to get.
There will be a possibility to use all issued SUR-tokens as a method of ensuring
guarantee on a granted surety in the Suretly app.
SUR tokens will be added to different exchanges not later then 5 working days
after the end of the ICO.
As by agreement between Suretly, Inc и SURcoin pte.ltd, Suretly, Inc. will be
transferring 0.2% of each loan secured by Suretly's investors to SURcoin pte.ltd.
It will begin doing this on a quarterly basis, after the 3rd quarter following the ICO
is completed. This money will be used by SURcoin pte.ltd buyback tokens from
exchanges. All purchased tokens will be burned.
The expected loans amount will depend on the number of lending partners and
the active system users number, which, in turn, will depend on the amount of
raised funds.

What’s more, Tezos was built to facilitate formal verification, a technique
which boosts the security of the most sensitive or financially weighted
smart contracts by mathematically proving the correctness of the code
governing transactions.
The Tezos blockchain will underpin secure, decentralized applications and
smart contracts while avoiding some of the political and technological
problems which earlier efforts such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have faced.
Tezos was built on the belief that a deep commitment to security, formal
verification, and governance that gives stakeholders the power to
make protocol decisions is the formula for earning trust and generating
widespread adoption on the blockchain.
This document provides a comprehensive overview of Tezos, its
applications and benefits, the developers involved in the project, the

THE
HISTORY
OF THE
TEZOS
BLOCKCHAIN

Work on Tezos began in 2014 by its
founding development team, whose
academic experience spans from
philosophy to physics, mathematics and
computer science, along with professional
experience that includes positions at
Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, The
Wall Street Journal, and Accenture. They
recognized that decentralized blockchains
share the same challenges that exist in
any commons (the name economists give
to a resource shared by several people),
specifically that challenges around
governance and maintenance often lead
to stagnation, shortages, and political
deadlock.
In the case of pioneers like Bitcoin
and Ethereum, those challenges have
manifested themselves in situations that
put too much power in the hands of core
development teams or miners. In other
words, first-generation blockchains have
become subject to a form of centralization
that their developers sought to avoid.
During three years of development, the
Tezos team sought to address the need
for decentralized innovation in protocol
design and emphasized the importance of
formal verification in its software design
philosophy.

GOALS

While all blockchains offer financial
incentives for maintaining consensus
on their ledgers, no blockchain has
a robust on-chain mechanism to
seamlessly amend the rules governing
its protocol and explicitly fund
protocol development. As a result,
first generation blockchains tend to
empower, de facto, centralized core
development teams or miners to
formulate design choices.
Tezos takes a fundamentally different
approach by creating governance
rules for stakeholders to approve
of protocol upgrades that are then
automatically deployed on the
network. When a developer proposes
a protocol upgrade, they can attach an
invoice to be paid out to their address
upon approval and inclusion of their

upgrade. This approach provides a
strong incentive to contribute efforts
towards core development of the Tezos
blockchain and further decentralizes
the maintenance of the network. It
compensates developers with tokens
that have immediate value rather
than forcing them to seek corporate
sponsorships, foundation salaries, or
work for Internet fame alone.

a mechanism to enable collective
decision making. Tezos tokens not only
power smart contracts in the network,
but also allow votes on protocol
amendments. The initial Tezos rollout is
simple by design, but its self-amending
nature means that the rules governing
the network can be improved over
time.

Tezos instantiates new technical
innovations but can also enforce types
of constitutionalism through the use
of formal proofs to mathematically
verify that key properties are upheld
over time. By allowing stakeholders
to coordinate on-chain, the network
also allows for the creation of bounties
to implement specific features or
discover bugs. Collectively, the network
maintains the decentralized aspect
of blockchains while introducing

2.2 CORRECTNESS
Blockchains underpin billions of dollars
of value with relatively small codebases,
which puts them in the sweet spot
for formal verification, a powerful
technique that mathematically proves
the correctness of computer programs.
Formal verification has been used in the
aerospace industry, in medical devices,
and other instances where the stakes
are too high to fail.

GOALS

Formally verifying a complex piece
of software is a sizable task, so the
development team sought to simplify
it as much as possible. To that end,
we implemented Tezos in OCaml, a
functional programming language
that has been developed and
maintained by the INRIA since 1996
(and itself based on earlier efforts). Its
speed is comparable to that of C++
and it generally features among the
fastest programming languages in
benchmark testing. More importantly,
OCaml is strongly typed and offers
an impressive type inference system.
Its expressive syntax and semantics,
including powerful pattern matching
and higher-order modules, make it easy
to concisely and correctly describe the
type of logic underpinning blockchainbased protocols. OCaml’s semantic is
fairly rigorous and a very large subset
has been formalized, which removes
any ambiguity as to what is the
intended behavior of amendments.
In addition, Coq, one of the most
advanced proof-checking software
tools, is able to extract OCaml code
from proofs. As Tezos matures, it will

be possible to automatically extract
key parts of the protocol’s code from
mathematical proofs of correctness.

2.2.2 MICHELSON
The correctness of smart contracts
running on the Tezos blockchain is
almost as important as that of the core
protocol itself. Smart contract bugs can
taint the reputation of the platform they
operate on. To mitigate that risk, the
development team designed our smart
contract language with correctness and
formal verification in mind.
Michelson is statically typed and
purely functional. This design largely
eliminates large classes of bugs such
as the DAO reentrancy bug or the
Solidity ABI vulnerability discovered by
the Golem project. The language itself
looks like a mix between Forth and Lisp
and a reference is available here. The
Tezos development team has already
successfully proven the correctness of
Michelson contracts in Coq, including
the multisig contract.
More information about these design
choices are found in the Tezos position
paper and white paper.

In its initial incarnation, Tezos is
launching with a delegated proof-ofstake consensus algorithm. This choice
of consensus algorithm is amendable,
on-chain, by the stakeholders. In
principle, a proof-of-work consensus or
even a federated consensus could take
its place. However, the development
team expects proof-of-stake to be an
important part of the Tezos culture
and thinks it will remain the primary
consensus method.
Tezos’ delegated proof-of-stake system
works by letting every stakeholder
designate one or several delegates
of their choice to create blocks and
validate transactions on their behalf.
The higher the stake delegated to
a given validator, the more often
will they be called upon to create
blocks. Though the Tezos system is
delegated, every token holder can
participate as a delegate regardless
of the amount they hold.

The network issues newly minted
tokens as a reward to validators
for the service they provide to the
network. These rewards will create
nominal inflation; holders are free
to be their own delegate if they
so desire and thus to avoid any
dilution. It likely that large delegates
will offer to share some of their profits
in a bid to attract more stakes.
The computing requirements to
become a validator are relatively
lightweight (a few hundred watts
at most) but a robust, high-speed
Internet connection is required.
Running a proof-of-stake node also
requires more operational security
than running a mining operation as it
involves signing blocks with a private
key on a machine connected to the
Internet. This risk can be mitigated
by the use of secure hardware
components, as found in devices like
the Trezor or the Ledger Nano S.

The development
team expects
proof-of-stake to
be an important
part of the Tezos
culture and thinks
it will remain the
primary consensus
method.

The Tezos blockchain is primarily
being developed by Dynamic Ledger
Solutions, Inc. (“DLS”) a US-based
company co-founded by Kathleen and
Arthur Breitman.
Arthur was born in France and educated
at École Polytechnique in math, physics,
and computer science. He then went
on to a career in quantitative finance,
including positions at Goldman Sachs
and Morgan Stanley. Kathleen holds a
BA from Cornell University and worked
at The Wall Street Journal, Bridgewater
Associates, Accenture, and R3 prior to
Tezos.
Kathleen met Arthur at a cryptoanarchist meetup in New York in 2010
and they’ve been together ever since.

3.2 THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM
Tezos is a small team. The philosophy behind
the Tezos project dictates that the core team
should not be the only contributors to the
Tezos project. That being said, the original team
will obviously play a critical role in growing and
improving the network in its infancy.
There are currently ten core developers: Arthur
Breitman, Benjamin Canou, Çağdaş Bozman,
Pierre Chambart, Grégoire Henry, Mohamed
Iguernlala, Fabrice Le Fessant, Alain Mebsout,
Vincent Bernardoff, and Guillem Rieu.
Our development team is primarily located
in Paris, France and has been working on
the Tezos ledger through a partnership
with OCamlPro, a software company with
deep OCaml expertise founded by Fabrice
Le Fessant. Most of our developers have
Ph.Ds in Computer Science and expertise in
programming language theory.

3.3 THE TEZOS FOUNDATION

3.4 ADVISORS

Tezos’ founders thought it that it would be
beneficial for the the Tezos Network if a nonprofit foundation could guide its early steps
and complement the decentralized nature of its
governance model. The Tezos Foundation is an
independent Swiss entity whose goal is to promote
and foster the use of the Tezos blockchain, its
technology and its ongoing development.

Tezos advisors currently include:

Since the early days of the Tezos network are
critical, the Tezos foundation will retain a veto
power over protocol upgrades for a period of one
year from minting the Genesis block. However,
the Foundation does not and will not have any
privileged power in proposing protocol upgrades.
Any protocol upgrade proposed by the Foundation
will need to be vetted and agreed upon by the
stakeholders just as any other proposal would.
The members of the Foundation council are
Johann Gevers, Diego Ponz, and Guido SchmitzKrummacher. Johann Gevers is one of the founders
of the Cryptovalley ecosystem in Zug, Switzerland,
as well as the CEO of Monetas, a digital payments
company based in Zug. Diego Ponz is a computer
scientist and entrepreneur with an expertise
in combinatorial optimization. Guido SchmitzKrummacher is a businessman in the Zug area.

In order to fund the last phases of
Tezos’ development, the DLS team
received backing from ten entities
from September 2016 through March
2017. Three of these entities were
hedge funds with a specific focus
on tokens. The other seven backers
were high net-worth individuals,
or federations thereof, many of
whom were also LPs of the hedge
funds. Total early funding amounts
to $612,000. In order to value the
early participants in this project, the
Tezos Foundation will recommend an
allocation of XTZ tokens equivalent
to $893,200.77 in contributions
(corresponding to a 31.48% discount).
No single backer represented more
than 33% of the total amount.
DLS chose these backers strategically,
with an emphasis on people and
entities who were philosophically
in-line with our uncapped fundraising
structure and are long-term believers
in the Tezos protocol, either based on
their technical expertise or familiarity
with the founding team.

Following the example set by the
Ethereum Foundation, there is no cap
on the amount of contributions that
will be accepted by the Foundation.
This is done in order to ensure that
participation is not limited only to
insiders or the “fast-fingered”. The
Tezos development team believes
that an un-capped fundraiser will
promote a widespread distribution of
the tokens, a necessary prerequisite
to launching a robust network.
Though the amount of Tezzies
allocated is denominated in bitcoins,
contributions may be made in ethers,
that will be implicitely converted at
the prevailing rate on a best effort
basis. Contributions may also be
made through Bitcoin Suisse AG who
accepts fiat currencies and other
electronic tokens and will participate
in the fundraiser on behalf of its
customers.
The fundraiser will last for a period of
2,000 Bitcoin blocks. Throughout this
period, a contribution of one bitcoin
(1 XBT) will lead to an allocation of
five-thousand tezzies (5,000 XTZ) plus

a time dependent bonus. This bonus
is meant to incentivize contributors
not to delay their participation. The
bonus starts at 20%, meaning that
a contribution of 1 XBT will yield an
allocation of 5,000 X (1 + 20%) = 6,000
XTZ and decreases progressively to
0% over 5 periods lasting 400 Bitcoin
blocks each.

The average time between Bitcoin blocks
is approximately 10 minutes, thus the
fundraiser is expected to last approximately
two weeks, and each period of 400 blocks
roughly two days and eighteen hours.
The Foundation will manage the proceeds
of the fundraiser and sell contributions
progressively throughout the fundraising
period in order to reduce the risk inherent
in holding cryptographic tokens.

The Tezos Foundation will manage the
contributions according to its purpose.
Initially, the Foundation will budget
from four to six years, depending on
the amount raised. After this period, the
Foundation will phase itself out unless
the community votes to keep it in
existence through funding via tokens.
The Foundation will have the discretion
to pay for services it believes will
benefit the promotion of the Tezos
protocol, either in tokens or another
currency. This section outlines initial
team believes the Foundation should
value, as well as the estimated costs for
servicing each priority based on the
proceeds of a fundraiser.

5.1 ENGINEERING

5.2 RESEARCH

The primary task of the Foundation
is to ensure the functionality of the
network. To this end, the Foundation
will, at a minimum, retain the original
development team at the current
annual cost of $900,000. This will
cover maintenance, as well as some
integrations and proposals. Over four
years, this will cost the Foundation
$3.6 million.

The Tezos protocol currently
benefits from research in the formal
verification and programming
language communities at no cost.
The initial development team of
Tezos has a strong philosophical
commitment to formal verification
and a keen interest in researching
new consensus algorithms for
blockchains. The Foundation will
look to fund research in this area
with its endowment from the
fundraiser.

DLS partnered with OCamlPro, a
company based in Paris with deep
expertise in OCaml. Most of the
developers working on Tezos have
PhDs in formal verification and
programming language theory.

5.3 LEGAL SERVICES
Currently, Doug Barnes works on
behalf of Dynamic Ledger Solutions,
the company developing Tezos,
through Barnes Legal. In addition
to his legal qualifications, Doug was
also involved in the cypherpunk
movement in the early 90s. The Swiss
law firm MME represents the Tezos
Foundation and will continue to do so
after the token generation event.

5.4 COMMUNICATIONS
AND MARKETING
Currently, DLS retains communications
consultancy to support its marketing
efforts. As stated in the original Tezos
whitepaper, DLS believes that the
advocacy and marketing of protocols
are integral to gaining greater
acceptance of them from a wide
community.
The Foundation exists to drive
an ecosystem around the Tezos
protocol. Similar projects have
seen extraordinary success from

running meetups across the world. The
Foundation will target New York, Tokyo,
and Paris for events and meetups.
In the spirit of community building, the
Foundation will also provide a forum
attached to the www.tezos.com domain
that can facilitate debate on proposals.
This isn’t meant to be the only forum for
discussion and posts will be moderated
to weed out abusive actors. Though
the Tezos community will converge on
a place to discuss proposals, it makes
sense for the Foundation to spend a
modest amount to create and moderate a
potential option.

5.5 BUSINESS
DEVELOPMENT
Non-engineering Tezos protocol efforts
entail managing potential partnerships,
marketing, financial transactions, and
business operations broadly construed.
It will soon be necessary to solicit more
business development people to interface
with non-technical stakeholders, as
well as help manage Tezos vendors and
contractors.

GOALS

Though our philosophy and
governance model constrains
how prescriptive the Foundation
and the initial team can act,
we thought it was worth
documenting the types of
things the Foundation will
work to realize within the Tezos
community.

6.1 COMMUNITY
GOALS
Since Tezos has a built-in governance
mechanism, its protocol can evolve
and incorporate new innovations over
time. In other words, stakeholders can
make and enforce decisions about
changes to the network using the
network itself.

tezos.com

All protocol changes should go
through the Tezos internal governance
mechanism when possible. If a person
or party introduces a change via a
hard fork, but that change could easily
have been instigated inside of Tezos,
the network should reject that change
and treat it as illegitimate.
However, some decisions will
inevitably arise at a level that cannot
be fully addressed within the network.
The founding team would like to have
a certain ethos govern the network.
Namely, they believe the central goal
of the governance mechanism is to
protect the interest of each token
holder, irrespective of their stake, in
their capacity as a token holder.
Generally speaking, this would mean
favoring decisions that tend toward
increasing the value of the tokens. Not
only does this directly benefit token

holders, but it also acts as a proxy for
the most desirable properties, such as
security, fairness, or usefulness.
The ideal Tezos community would
be intellectually rigorous without
sacrificing pragmatism and inclusive
without tolerating belligerence. There
would be a focus on experimentation,
testing, and folding in the most useful
and innovative technical tools for the
community to use. The Foundation
does not endorse or look to facilitate
any immoral behavior such as fraud
or the instigation of violence on other
beings or entities.
Tezos should be comprised of a
community of serious thinkers,
focused on preparing the most
effective upgrades to increase the
utility of the Tezos token. The network
will reward these proposals by issuing
them new tokens upon acceptance,
creating a robust pecuniary incentive.

6.2 DEVELOPMENT
GOALS
The development goals
of Tezos follow five axes:
security, scaling, privacy,
usability, and features.
The development team
will pursue all five goals
somewhat in parallel but not
with the same priority.

6.2.1 SECURITY

6.2.2 SCALING

Tezos is built on a fresh code base. This
let the development team control every
aspect of the initial design and benefit
from the advanced safety features of
OCaml, but it also means that the system
hasn’t been battle-tested yet. Both Bitcoin
and Ethereum successfully recovered
from critical bugs in their code base, but
such crises should be avoided as much
as humanly possible. Therefore, the
development team’s primary focus will be to
continuously work to improve the resilience
of the network to DDOS attacks or malicious
fork. Every other effort on the ledger is for
naught if the core team fails to properly
secure the network. Concretely, they will:

The Tezos proof-of-stake algorithm affords
us better scalability and transaction
throughput that can be achieved with
Bitcoin style proof-of-work. However,
the initial parameters are set very
conservatively in order to let us assess its
performance in the real world and allow
the ecosystem of validators to grow.
Once the ledger accumulates real world
experience, the development team will
work towards cranking up the transaction
throughput by:

• Keep increasing the test coverage of the
code base
• Develop formal proofs of correctness for
the most sensitive parts of the code
• Submit security upgrades to the protocol
as needed
• Improve the randomness generation
protocol with public verifiable secret
sharing
• Release security upgrades to the block
creation software
• Produce recommendations for
operational security of block validators

Note that the consequences of increasing
the blocks’ size in proof-of-stake are
very different from the consequences of
increasing the block size in a Nakamoto
proof-of-work systems. In Nakamoto
proof-of-work any increase in block size
gives a slight advantage to centralized
miners. This is because proof-of-work
requires the block propagation and
validation time to be very small compared
to the block interval. In synchronous proofof-stake protocols like Tezos’, it only needs
to be smaller than the block interval.

• Increasing the block size
• Lowering the block time interval
• Packing transactions more efficiently

6.2.3 PRIVACY
Privacy preserving transactions and smart
contracts are a key feature of modern
blockchains. Not only are they a security
requirement, they ensure censorship
resistance much more effectively than any
tweaking of the consensus algorithm.

However no solution is perfect yet. Ring
signatures, as used in Monero, can still leak
some information about senders. Zcash
makes an impressive use of zero-knowledge
proofs to provide full, information theoretic,
anonymity, but the risk – however remote –
of undetected hyperinflation in the event of
a bug in the proof circuit makes some users
uncomfortable.
Our initial plan is to strike a compromise
and integrate Zcash’s proof circuit in the
protocol, but restrict its operations to a
special token issued on the Tezos blockchain.
This token will be convertible 1 to 1 with
Tezos tokens, but the chain will keep track
of how many tokens have been converted
so that undetected inflation in the privacy
preserving token cannot spill over onto the
main token. Users who trust the security
of the privacy preserving token will have
full use of its functionality while those who
don’t will remain protected as long as they

do not make use of the privacy feature. This
mechanism replicates the economic behavior
of a side chain, but on a single ledger.
In the long run, the team intends to replace
all operations on the blockchain with zeroknowledge proofs. Instead of downloading
an entire blockchain a client will be able to
download a single proof attesting that the
entire blockchain has been validated starting
from the genesis hash. However, to that end,
they will likely make use of STARKs, zero
­knowledge proofs similar to SNARKs but which
do not require a trusted setup.

6.2.4 USABILITY
Initially, the Foundation team’s primary task
will be to build robust, scalable, and secure
infrastructure. However, the development team
also needs to make it an attractive platform. In
particular, they will:
• Develop light client libraries in most popular
programming languages to help developers
integrate with the Tezos network.
• Develop an IDE to facilitate development and
formal verification in Michelson.
• Develop a certified compiler for a highlevel language that will compile down to
Michelson.

Initially, the
Foundation
team’s primary
task will be to
build robust,
scalable,
and secure
infrastructure.

6.2.5 FEATURES

6.3 RESEARCH GOALS

“Features” are decentralized applications
supported at the protocol level. In Ethereum,
the prevailing trend is to deploy these “DApps”
through App Coins, a way for developers to build
specially marked tokens to power applications on
an existing network which can be converted inand-out of the main network token.

The initial development team’s research goals
represent longer term developments or ideas to
push out of the lab and deploy.

While Tezos permits the creation of App Coins,
we do not focus on them. If an application is
particularly valuable to the network, we believe
it should be folded into the protocol. Though
we do not know exactly yet which features will
be voted into the protocol level by the network,
some applications seem to have widespread
appeal in similar projects: prediction markets, DNS
systems, on-chain node identity, debt networks (à
la Stellar), decentralized exchanges, file storage,
and cloud computing. More exotic or specialized
applications, such as the Numéraire project, are
probably better fits for App Coins as they have less
explicitly general appeal.

Right now, the Tezos development team is fascinated
with a new development in zero-knowledge proofs:
STARKs. Unlike SNARKs, STARKs do not require a
trusted setup. They also rely on simpler mathematics
and are more efficient to compute. However, the
proof time of STARKs is still cumbersome.

Unproven systems ought to innovate at the leaves,
while tried-and-true features ought to have a way
to make the network more valuable by integrating
at the protocol level. This is not purely for the sake
of creating more valuable networks but also for
ensuring consistency of execution.

Summary
True Flip is a blockchain lottery platform. We have already developed a bitcoin-based and fair-proof lottery
6/49 (Powerball*) and plan to make at least 3 more lottery games. It is the first stage of the development and
we have done half the work already.
In order to fulfill our mission in the best possible way we are making the whole lottery fully transparent: every
ticket sold, every win, all the token holder rewards distributed and financial results will be published on the
blockchain.
The second goal is to make True Flip platform as decentralized as virtually possible. We also intend to use
decentralized hosting and multiple data centers so that discontinuation of one of them would have no effect
on the platform in general.
The third, probably the most ambitious goal is to create a platform which could be used by private companies,
charitable foundations and even governments to set up any kind of lotteries. Further details are set forth in
this Whitepaper.
As the first step, we plan to create True Flip tokens which will grant their holders an access to daily rewards
and entitle them to vote on the lottery’s future development. We will also launch a Token Sale in order to
distribute 70% of all True Flip tokens within the community. The team will own 20% of the tokens to remain
motivated to keep on developing the project. The remaining 10% will be used to pay for advisers, escrow and
bounty services. All unsold tokens will be burned.
There will be 21`000`000 of the TFL Tokens issued at the rate of 0.0005 BTC per 1 Token. During the ICO
14`700`000 Tokens will be put on sale. 10 to 15% of the ticket sales revenues will be proportionally distributed
between all the TFL Token holders.
True Flip Group SRL is incorporated in Costa Rica, which officially allows online gambling.
Trueflip.io website contains Terms & conditions, Public offer, Privacy Policy and Referral System Agreement.

Gambling market overview
According to H2 Gambling Capital (www.h2gc.com), the casino business was a major revenue contributor to
the offline gambling market in 2016. In money equivalent, it accounted for $132.8 billion with a 37% market
share. The lottery segment occupied 30.9% (or $111 billion), followed by slot machines with 19.3% (or $69.4
billion).

When it comes to the online gambling market, there were certain differences. The leader was Betting, with a
48.7% market share ($21.4 billion). It was followed by casino business and lotteries. Each with 26.8% ($11.8
billion) and 8.8% ($3.85 billion), respectively.
As online lottery has an added value and low market share in comparison to offline lottery, it seems that this
segment has strong market potential in the future.

As a result, the size of offline gambling market accounted for $359.3 billion in 2016, while online gambling market was $44 billion. As can be seen from the graph below, both offline and online markets are gradually growing. It is notable that online gambling is increasing with a higher growth rate in comparison with offline one.
According to the H2 Gambling Capital forecast, the offline gambling industry will occupy only 11.5% of the
overall market revenue, whereas online one will keep increasing in the future. It is expected that revenues from
the online gambling market will exceed $60 billion by 2020, at a compound annual growth rate of around 10%.

Blockchain technology in online gambling
Cryptocurrencies quickly seize the online gambling market, turning into the most popular means of payment
among gambling sites. Until recently, only several resources accepted Bitcoins, but today its integration into
payment systems has become ubiquitous.
Many participants of the online gambling market believe that the cryptocurrencies will continue to occupy this
industry. This mostly happens due to its lower regulators control relative to fiat money for both players and
online operators. Other advantages include:
- no need to identify users;
- no restrictions on the amount of transactions;
- acceleration of payments;
- lowering the minimum payment threshold.
It looks like cryptocurrencies are turning into the most reliable, transparent and profitable medium of circulation for the online gambling industry. Soon the online casinos on blockchain will become as familiar as the
Internet.
With the advent of blockchain technology, which gives transparency and cross-border dimension to the whole
industry, it became possible to make an honest international lottery. Moreover, thanks to the new trend of
smart contracts for Ethereum, this lottery can belong to the community and not to a handful of stakeholders.

1. Introduction
So, when we talk about a lottery based on blockchain technology, we are talking about linking the wide lottery
participation in the whole gambling market to the constant and significant growth of Bitcoin’s* share in the
global financial market.

Fif th of population
par take in lot teries

Bitcoin market capitalization

2016

$12.5 Million bitcoin

$218 bln. spent on

the world in 2016

Combined, those trends bring about brand new opportunities for online gambling, especially considering the
increasing number of networked devices and the number of users who prefer to play online and anonymously.
Despite the turnover and the prevalence of lotteries as one of the most important games in the world, there are
numerous problems concerning fair play due to the issues surrounding the raffles and the awards.
As was mentioned above, presently a large number of issues involving prize distribution and fairness of raffles
are observed, which becomes even worse when associated with the difficulty of receiving the prize and the
high fees and taxes involved.
However, with the massive use of blockchain technology, we finally have the opportunity to solve these old
problems, bringing about the complete and total transparency of all the operations involving the True Flip platform as the main change and the most important advantage.
On True Flip platform, all lottery issues such as ticket purchase, random number generation for betting and
draws, prize fund composition, prize tickets verification, prize distribution and other operations are 100% implemented using blockchain technology and open source code available on GitHub**. TrueFlip token (TFL)
holders are entitled to enforce any changes suggested for the platform.

* — Bitcoin is both a cryptocurrency and an electronic payment system invented by an unidentified programmer, or
group of programmers, under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was introduced on 31 October 2008 to a cryptography mailing list, and released as open-source software in 2009. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin

1. Introduction
Mission
Lotteries give a chance to dramatically change one’s life for the better. This chance has always drawn the
attention of millions of people around the world for the past 500 years, giving them hope to improve their
financial condition.
True Flip’s goal is to become the most popular and transparent blockchain lottery that belongs to international
community and offers the biggest Jackpot in the world.
Most of currently existing lotteries are totally centralized or even held by governments and are hardly transparent. Our mission is to build True Flip as a provably fair and decentralized lottery platform that neither any
nation state, nor a single authority, nor members of our team could control.

We also take into account the following points on the way to our goal:
- Online gambling is recognized as the fastest-growing sector in the industry;
- The synergy of the cryptocurrencies and gambling market opens up new opportunities for projects in this
industry;
- The size of the lottery market in the offline sector is about € 100 billion, while in the online sector it is only
about € 3.5 billion;
- By combining the advantages of Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies (as a means of payment), we
will be able to seize the market share from classic lotteries by turning their disadvantages into our possibilities.

2. Operating scheme
True Flip is the international anonymous lottery based on the blockchain technology with instant payouts and
the source code of the winning combination is publicly available.
Our game looks the same as any ordinary lottery (for example Powerball): you guess five numbers between
1 and 49 and one number between 1 and 26. We decided to significantly increase the probability of winning
by reducing the total quantity of numbers from 75 to 49, which makes the chance of winning 1.3 times higher
than in Powerball. After that, our system randomly draws six numbered balls and the whole process is totally
transparent.
However, these are all similarities to classic lotteries. Our advantage comes from the fact that our lottery is
fully based on Bitcoin blockchain. Everything concerning draw process must be transparent to every user and
exclude any possibility of meddling with results. We applied those advanced IT technologies to completely
overhaul the rules of the game that had not seen any major changes for almost 500 years. Our goal is to make
it more convenient, open, fair, and valuable.

How does the draw take place and why is it transparent?
The Trueflip.io lottery system works by taking the first block in blockchain which fits in the technical requirements that appears after 8:00 p.m. UTC (which is impossible to know in advance, because last ticket for the
draw cannot be purchased after 7:30 p.m. UTC) and plugs it into the algorithm, which can be found on Github,
to generate the six numbers for the upcoming drawing. This process repeats for every draw at 8:00 p.m. every
day. The full explanation about the process can be watched on Youtube* or read in an article in Trueflip’s official Medium Blog **.
Because it is a lottery based on blockchain, it is possible to obtain several advantages, applying advanced
technologies to completely transform the way the game is processed:
-

Any person from any place in the world should be able to sign in to our lottery without providing any

private information;
-

The draw process is operated by open-source software. This excludes any possibility of the project’s

team of interfering with the draw process.;
-

Prize payouts are executed instantly, no third parties involved. All payments are shown in the open

blockchain ledger and any player may make sure that we’ve given all prizes in full concordance with lottery
rules.
-

All transactions are reflected in the open registry (blockchain) and any user can monitor payment pro-

cessing all the time.
With that, one needs no ID, licence, or registration to work with Bitcoin - it’s enough just to create a wallet (on
Blockchain.info, for example). In fact, the Bitcoin network is accessible to everybody connected to the Internet. This monetary system, as well as our lottery which is Bitcoin-based and works pursuant to the same rules,
is one of the most friendly and open technologies today.

2. Operating scheme
All those features enable us to provide quality entertainment to any user that wants to test their luck on a
daily basis by playing in the lottery, as well as make Trueflip the number one blockchain lottery in the Bitcoin
community.

Distribution of the prize fund
The system automatically converts every payment to bitcoin and transfers funds to the prize fund of the lottery. The platform prize fund is transparent and always open for viewing due to blockchain technology, and
accounts for 60% of the ticket cost. (for more information about the distribution of the ticket sales revenue,
see the Business model section).
A bet wins when numbers of the ticket match the numbers of the winning set according to the table below.

Winnings in these categories are determined after calculation of winnings with fixed prizes. The payout fund
is the difference between the amount of the prize fund of the run and amount payable for fixed-prize winnings.
The Jackpot is initially formed at the ICO stage and is refilled by the lottery tickets being sold.
For more information about the lottery process and winnings distribution see section 9 (Lottery features).

3. Business model
TrueFlip offers a transparent business model for TFL Token holders. Every sold ticket, winnings, withdrawals,
bonuses and operational expenses will be open for every TFL token holder and recorded onto the blockchain,
so it will not change.
The main service that generates TrueFlip’s profits is ticket sales. The structure below shows how cash flow is
assigned to main areas of expenditures.

The ticket price comprises 0.001 BTC or its Ethereum or Litecoins equivalent. Our basic forecast suggests
15`000 sold tickets per day. This number accounts for only 0.4% of the global online-gambling market in current prices. After the launch of three new lotteries, the daily turnover in our model might reach 50`000 sold
tickets (1.3% of the world market).
After a player buys a ticket, the funds will be distributed as follows:

1. 60% goes straight to the Jackpot
2. 15-20%* for marketing
3. 5-10%* for operations
4. 2% - referral awards
5. 10-15%* to the token holders
* This spread depends on policy, that will be agreed with all TFL token holders via voting on said issues.

4. Marketing strategy
Since May 10, 2017, when our marketing strategy started, we have achieved some stats: daily traffic is more
than 35,000 visitors*, more than 18`000+ tickets played daily, and overall winning of 12.3 BTC. In order to stimulate the steady growth of the platform, users can participate in one or more specific promotion campaigns
accordingly with their user profile and the desired extent of their involvement.

1. All players can spread the word about this innovative lottery platform and invite friends and other players
using their personal referral link. After your referred friends sign up on TrueFlip, both you and them get a
free ticket to start playing. Users will receive 2% of their referred players’ winnings on an ongoing basis
(including the Jackpot!). This feature is also implemented without human involvement and is part of the
marketing strategy called “Friends’ Winnings”. Thus, True Flip users continuously remain interested in inviting other players to the platform, because each guest ends up increasing the chances of winning in each
new draw.
2. Another deep marketing strategy consists in joining a partnership network, which is a technological platform connecting advertisers and partners, ensuring financial and informational interaction between them.
Any kind of business organizations get an opportunity of holding advertising campaigns online. On the
other hand, media partners get instruments for selection and deployment of advertising offers. We are also
developing a widget for quick lottery tickets purchase on the websites of our partners.
3. Given the importance of a well-defined marketing plan, it is impossible to ignore the increase in the number
of Internet users around the world and the effect that blogs and specialised sites have on those users. Despite the huge number of pages on the most varied platforms, the list of most influential pages practically
does not change, varying only the local classification between them. This characteristic allows us to easily
identify the most effective media to run public campaigns. We will also use the power of social networks
and their tools in our marketing strategy.
4. In addition, we intend to conduct various media advertising, PR-campaigns, off-line activities in different
regions and non-standard advertising through the attraction of off-line partners.Concerning the marketing
budget, it is expensive but effective to achieve 250,000+ users per day. However, this detailed plan is supported by financial resources previously set forth in the platform’s fund-sharing strategy. All reports will be
fully transparent for the Token holders.

6. Token Sale
First of all, what differs True Flip’s Token sale from other ICO’s and Token sales is that we have already made
the product, as opposed to others who just promise to develop something in the future.

Why do we still need to sell Tokens?
Here are the main issues:
1.

Jackpot. A lottery is interesting only if there is a BIG Jackpot. For a powerful launch we are planning to
raise 1`960 BTC for Jackpot via Token Sale campaign. This value is achieved by multiplying: 40% * TotalSaleGoal * 80%, where 40% - is a share of funds assigned for Jackpot, TotalSaleGoal – amount of money
raised during the Token Sale and 80% - is the first part of the Jackpot. The Jackpot will be secured on cold
wallets with use of multisignature escrow involving three community stakeholders, while the development
team won’t have any access to this money. So when someone lucky wins the Jackpot, it will be transferred
manually.

2.

Second Jackpot. We understand that the probability of winning the Jackpot is 1:49`504`950. But the
risk still exists, and we must ensure that we do everything we can to maximize the profitability of our investors. Therefore, we will have a second Jackpot, the size of 490 BTC, which corresponds to 20% of the funds
assigned for the Jackpot. The calculation is as follows: 40% * TotalSaleGoal * 20%. It will also be stored
on a cold wallet and use multisignature escrow involving three community stakeholders, but will only be
used if the first Jackpot is won. Thus, we minimize the risk of losing interest to our lottery if during one of
the first drawings the Jackpot will be won.

3.

Transparency. We want to prove to the blockchain community that our game is fair. At this very moment True Flip is not 100% decentralized. Our team knows about this and has a plan on how to make True
Flip as much decentralized as virtually possible. Our next goal is to make the lottery independent of any
third-party (including the team).

4.

Development. We plan to develop 3 (three) more lotteries based on smart contracts (more info in 16
paragraph of Whitepaper).

5.

Marketing and PR. We understand that a project can hardly attract millions of customers without a
marketing budget. So selling TFL tokens will assemble a budget for a global marketing campaign.

ICO details
We have successfully completed the pre-ICO, in which 1`050`000 TFL tokens were sold (5% of the total
amount). The raised funds will be used to finance operations and to increase the jackpot.

Expected Token Sale commencement date: June 20th, 2017.
Issuance of TFL Tokens: 21`000`000 TFL tokens

The price of the TFL Token is 0.0005 BTC. During the ICO we’ll be collecting the funds in Bitcoin, Ether and
Litecoin. Token Sale goal: 6`125 BTC including the bonuses.

40% will be on hold until reaching the KPI (launch of 3 new lotteries);

3.

40% will be on hold for 1 year.

At the initial stage Tokens will be distributed between the managing team as a reward for their efforts to bring
True Flip platform to existence. In the future these Tokens can be negotiated among other partners interested
in development and growth of the project/platform.
All unsold tokens will be burned.

6. Token Sale
Escrow of the Token Sale funds
Our escrows are:

•

Richard Kestelein - CEO (www.cryptoassets.io, Blockchain News, www.the-blockchain.com and www.
blockchain-partners.com).

•

George Basiladze - Founder of Cryptopay, UK bitcoin payment gateway (www.cryptopay.me)

•

Nikita Parhomenko - Co-Founder and COO of True Flip (www.trueflip.io).

Public addresses will be published right after the start of the ICO.
The raised funds will be (in a con rmation or two) transferred to a 2/3 multi-signature address, with two
of the keys held by trusted third-party individuals (Escrow). This way the funds are protected in an escrow
account that will be released in de ned cases, described below. The raised funds can only be accessed with
the consent of at least two of the three signees and when all the conditions are met.

•

Bitcoin collecting address;

•

Ethereum collecting address;

•

Litecoin collecting address.

Responsibilities of the crowdfunding escrow are as follows:

•

Veri cation of the amount and the source of funds not observable on public blockchains through documentation provided by True Flip;

•

Determining the conditions for a successful or unsuccessful crowdfund in regard to this information;
Acting in accordance with this condition to either transfer or refund wallets under partial control of an
arbitrator;

•

Recording the time and the type of arbitrator work hours (via Google doc, viewing and commenting publicly).

Decidedly not responsible for:

•

Verifying the functioning of smart contracts or technical infrastructure;

•

Conforming to or being held liable for the lawful compliance of the investment structure.

Liability:

•

Preserving wallets to the best of the arbitrator’s knowledge and skills (minimum are one set of redundant paper wallets and one copy of wallets offline);

•

In case of negligence to any degree, the maximum liability is the sum of those values and fees that
would otherwise be generated, through reimbursement.

7. Token investment
attractiveness
Once the ICO is completed, the TFL Token will be available for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges. At the
moment, we negotiate the details with several exchanges and will announce the results as soon as the agreements are reached.
TFL Token is the main investment asset of the True Flip platform. It guarantees the Token holders a daily
bonus in BTC: 10-15% from each sold ticket will be distributed among all Token holders as dividends:

•
•
•
•
•
•

dividends are accrued daily after each draw;
dividends are paid 4 times a year according to the results of each quarter;
the amount of dividend (within 10-15% of income) is determined by the Token holders voting;
the owners of the Tokens are notified in advance of the date of payment;
to receive a dividend, the holders must park their Tokens on the lottery server;
dividends will be calculated only on the parked Tokens in proportion:

The scheme of paying dividends and determining the list of persons entitled to receive it is similar to the
mechanism used in traditional corporate practice. Therefore, we assume that the dynamics of the TFL quotes
will be affected by the calendar features in the same way as traditional stock assets - for example, there will
be dividend gap in the shares. From our point of view, this will help to increase the speculative attractiveness
of the TFL Token.

attractiveness
According to the basic forecast, at the initial stage True Flip can seize up to 0.4% of the global online lotteries
market (or 0.03% of the world online gambling market), which corresponds to a daily turnover within the system at 15 BTC. In this case, the annual dividend yield of the TFL token will be approximately at 5.2-7.8% in BTC,
depending on the share of the ticket sales revenue assigned for dividend payments.

According to the optimistic forecast, at the initial stage True Flip can seize up to 1.1% of the global online
lotteries market, which corresponds to a daily turnover within the system at 50 BTC. In this case, the annual
dividend yield of the TFL token will be approximately at 17.4-26.1% in BTC, depending on the share of the ticket
sales revenue assigned for dividend payments.

From our point of view, both calculations are very conservative and do not take into account the growth potential of the whole market in general, and the potential of the True Flip platform for further expansion.

Every TFL Token holder has a personal panel with all data proven by blockchain transactions:

•

TFL token amount;

•

Value of tokens;

•

% of TFL tokens about all tokens;

•

bonuses earned from sold tickets;

•

8. Token technical aspects
The True Flip platform implements various feedback types according to the result of an operation performed
by the system. No human involvement is required. The purchase of betting tickets is the most frequent operation in the system and any financial movement in the platform is executed in Bitcoin regardless of the form
of payment initially used. However, you can not confuse the financial system with the token implemented on
the platform.
The token allows its owner to become a partner of the world’s largest blockchain-based lottery.

Token smart contract functionality
TFL token is ERC-20-compatible smart contract on Ethereum blockchain. Following this standard means that
tokens will be easily transferable between users using existing Ethereum wallets as well as allow exchanges
smoothly integrate this token into their trading platform.TFL token will be used to distribute rewards from
ticket sales among TFL Token holders. In order to stop exchanges from getting TFL holder’s rewards, token
functionality is extended.
The locking feature: every user with TFL tokens will have an option to lock their tokens for a specific amount
of time. Locked tokens will be the ones participating in rewards payout. But once tokens are locked, it will not
be possible to transfer them to other users until the locking period has finished.

Token sale technical aspects
TrueFlip token sale will use Ethereum blockchain. The structure of the sale is presented on the picture. During
the crowdsale there will be two ways to buy TFL tokens: first one is sending Ether directly to the ICO contract.
If people want to invest using other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin or Waves to participate in the crowdsale, they would need to send their money to the founders in the dashboard, and TrueFlip backend will create
a transaction to issue new tokens.
After that, in both scenarios, ICO contract will make a ‘contract call’ to the TFL Token Contract to mint new tokens and allocate them to a public address of an ICO investor. ICO contract is the only entity that will be able to
mint tokens. After the end date of the token sale or once all the tokens are sold, TrueFlip founders will issue a
transaction that will finalize the ICO. This will trigger minting the tokens for the team and prevent future tokens
from minting on the TFL Token Contract.

Rewards payouts
10-15% (the exact amount will be decided by voting) of revenue from each ticket sold will be distributed among
TFL Token holders based on the number of tokens they hold as outlined in the picture. Only “locked” balances
will be participating in reward payouts. As tickets are sold in Bitcoin, conversion to Ether will happen, and bonuses will be paid directly to the addresses of Token holders.

8. Token technical aspects
Voting with tokens
Our team understands that investors of the TrueFlip project receive not only a share in the project, but also all
inherent business risks. Therefore, in order to reduce the risks for our investors and for optimal further development of the TrueFlip project, we have developed a voting system on key issues that will arise as the project
develops. Any owner of the TFL Tokens will be able to send their offer to the TrueFlip team using a special form
on the website.

The basic voting rules with TFL tokens:
- voting is considered to be held if there is a quorum;
- one TFL token equals to one vote;
- only the parked tokens can participate in voting;
- only two options will be available for voting: YES or NO;
- for each issue on the voting agenda, a time frame for the beginning and the end of the voting period will be
provided;
- a decision on each item on the voting agenda is made by a simple majority of votes.
Voting of the Token owners is considered to be eligible (i.e. has necessary quorum) only if the number of the
TFL Tokens that took part in the process is more than 50% of the issued TFL tokens. If there was no quorum,
new terms for re-voting on the same issues will be announced. At the same time, on the second vote of the
Tokens owners, it will be considered eligible (that is, has the necessary quorum) if the number of the TFL Tokens that took part in the process is more than 30% of the issued TFL tokens. Proposals with text descriptions
will be created as separate contracts on Ethereum blockchain. In the dashboard, Token holders will be able to
associate their address with their decision on a particular proposal. Once the voting deadline has passed, the
contract will calculate the sum of tokens on addresses for decision as well as a number of tokens against this
proposal. Once all the votes are considered, the contract will save the results of the voting process, and it will
stay forever on the Ethereum blockchain.

Lottery transparency
The lottery happens every day. The winning ticket is picked based on the hash of the first block on the bitcoin
blockchain after 20:00 UTC. It will not be possible to buy a ticket after 19:30 UTC each day. To verify that
there were no ticket purchases after that time all ticket sales will be logged in the Lottery Ethereum contract.
Logging every single purchase separately will be quite expensive. Therefore, to save on the transaction costs,
TrueFlip backend will calculate the hash of each sold ticket and then compute a root hash in a Merkle tree for
all transactions (similar to the way it is done for transactions in bitcoin blocks). This root hash will be published on the Ethereum blockchain along with other information about the current lottery. Each separate transaction will still be available through the TrueFlip platform: information about each transaction should have the
tx_hash, ticket numbers. After the winning numbers are calculated, TrueFlip backend server will log them to
the same contract. Everyone can verify the numbers, as well as all payouts on the Ethereum blockchain and
make sure there is no cheating on the platform.

Test period
During the first 3 months after the ICO the jackpot will be limited to 200 BTC in order to test all the algorithms
in the system and prevent potential loss of the whole funds due to fraudulent actions. As soon as the platform
is audited to be safe, the remainder of the sum will be added.

Jackpot: increase and release
There are two jackpots in the True Flip lottery. Initially, they are created at the expense of funds raised during
the ICO: 40% of the total funds is allocated to the jackpot, 80% of which is assigned to the jackpot No. 1, and
the remaining 20% to the jackpot No. 2.
Jackpot number 2 is a reserve in case of winning the jackpot number 1. It is not refilled by revenue from the
sale of lottery tickets.
Jackpot number 1 - the main, it is played daily and is increased by selling lottery tickets.
If the jackpot is not raffled in the current draw, then the funds from the current jackpot are going to increase
the next. Thus, the Jackpot is growing constantly until the moment when someone wins it.
The platform keeps an archive of draws with the whole history and jackpot amounts for each raffle.
In case of winning jackpot 1, jackpot number 2 becomes the main one. At the same time, a new reserve jackpot
is created. Revenues from the lottery tickets sales are distributed in a ratio of 80:20 to the main and reserve
jackpot correspondingly.

Calculation
The mathematics of the lottery was developed by Felix Sidokhin.
The process of determination of the winning set has 3 stages:

•

Ticket sale for the current run ends 60 minutes before 8:00 p.m. (UTC);

•

At 8:00 p.m. (UTC), the first hash of transactions accessible for everybody on blockchain.info is taken and
this hash cannot be previously predicted;

•

This hash is incorporated into the algorithm that forms 6 numbers based on the arithmetic action. The
source code of the algorithm is open , and anybody can check and repeat calculations.

True Flip platform algorithm is clear and very comprehensible, and it is possible to understand how a winning
combination is generated following the simple steps below:

- Step 1: After the draw closes, the system waits for the next hash in the blockchain
- Step 2: Suppose this is the hash received by the system:
0000000000000000005867634c363284caf01ce5dd2d6e2a6c2ab26030f33493

© 2017 True Flip White Paper (Ver 1.0)

25

9. Lottery features
- Step 3:

This hash is then broken into sequences of 4 (four) characters, starting from the tail, and trans-

formed into a number using NHEX base 16:

0000 0000 0000 0000 0058 6763 4c36 3284 caf0 1ce5 dd2d 6e2a 6c2a b260 30f3 3493
(3493)16 = (13459)10

- Step 4: The found number (13459) is then divided by module of 49 (or 26 in the last iteration) and the remainder is taken as one of the balls:

13459 mod 49 = 274 * 49 + 33
(hence the first ball is 33)

- Step 5: The system repeats this iteration 5 times and discards numbers which are already in the set (for
the golden ball we simply use mod 26 instead of mod 49)
In case of doubts or just out of curiosity, the algorithm can be tested on TrueFlip website at
http://trueflip.io/check-honesty?lang=en.

Methods of depositing
True Flip platform also incorporates multiple payment methods, so every user has a chance to play the game.
As True Flip wants to be an international company and its founders realize that not every person has Bitcoins,
they decided to add multiple payment processors to the payment method in the hopes to increase the number of people playing. Aside from bitcoin, these payment methods include Ether, Litecoins, Waves and other
cryptocurrencies.
Since True Flip just entered its beta-testing phase, the number of available currencies is limited. However,
TrueFlip’s dedicated development team is working on an in-house exchange to work with a wide range of tradable cryptocurrencies (altcoins), like Ethereum and Litecoins.

Payouts of winning
Benefiting from the Bitcoin network features, when a ticket wins, the amount is instantly transferred to the
users wallets under their accounts. Further, users may:

•

send Bitcoins to their personal wallets in any other system and convert Bitcoins to any currency
of their choosing;

•

send Bitcoins directly to the exchange services and then convert to any currency;

•

use True Flip account for any Bitcoin expenses (the address of your True Flip wallet is the same
as in any other system).

1. Introduction
In the following document we will explain our proposal for the architecture of the vDice
Token (called: ‘vSlice’) and Crowdsale Smart Contract System.

​

The vDice game technology itself is live, processing bets. It can be viewed ​here​.
We will reuse, as much as possible, the s
​ tandardized code that exists in the Ethereum
ecosystem, with the aim of minimizing the implementation complexity. This will also
ensure system security.
In particular, the base of the architecture will be built upon the wallet contract and the
ERC20​ token contract. These have received extensive scrutiny and have been thoroughly
vetted by the Ethereum community.
Some modifications are needed in order to implement the custom logic, but the
abovementioned contracts will provide a solid groundwork from which to build.
2. Design and Features
The ‘vSlice’ Smart Contract System is a set of smart contracts which provide the
following features:
● A safe and auditable exchange of Ether (ETH) for ‘vSlice’ tokens during the creation
phase.
● Token holders will receive a share of vDice profit, proportional to the amount of tokens
held, in a fair and transparent way.
● Tokens will behave as any standard ERC20 token.
3. Architecture
We will achieve the objectives listed above with the following architecture:
● Manual Coin Locking
a) Each token holder gets an amount of token proportional to the ETH they
deposit into the Crowdsale (ICO), in the ratio of:
- Week 1 = 1 : 130
- Week 2 = 1 : 120
- Weeks 3 & 4 = 1 : 100

b) The profit from vDice is sent to the token contract and is accumulated in
its balance.
c) The token contract can be in any one of these two states:
i. Unlocked: tokens are freely transferable, and profit cannot
be withdrawn during this period of time. The length of
unlocked time period will be decided at contract
deployment: e.g 3 weeks.
ii. Locked: tokens cannot be transferred. Each token holder can
withdraw their profit share only during this period of time. The
profits which are not collected can be sent/withdrawn to the wallet
contract. The length of the locked time period should be decided at
contract deployment: e.g 1 week.
4. Analysis
It’s the most simple approach for distributing vDice game profits to token holders. It’s
the easiest to implement. It needs few modifications to the standard ERC20 token
contract. This will provide maximum security.
It should be remembered that if a ‘vSlice’ holder fails to withdraw their profits, they will
loss their share of the profits during that time period.
Coins are perfectly transferable and fungible on exchanges. However, sending to and
from exchanges is prevented during the coin-locking period.
5. GUI Wallet
A GUI wallet will be provided with the crowdsale. This will give a safe place to store
tokens, receive notifications of lock-periods and a offer a simple point-and-click interface
to call the withdrawal function and receive your share of vDice game profits.

1. Introduction to vDice
vDice is the leading blockchain-based betting game for the Ethereum network. It went
live on June 13th, 2016. It has processed almost 10,000 bets to-date.
It is a classic ‘SatoshiDICE-style’ betting game, implemented as an Ethereum Smart
Contract (Dapp), and exists on the Ethereum blockchain.
SatoshiDICE was the world’s first blockchain-betting game, built on Bitcoin’s blockchain
and released in April, 2012.
As of January 2013, SatoshiDICE had taken approximately US$ 15 million in bets.
2. How vDice Works
Ethereum builds and improves on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the same way, vDice builds
and improves on blockchain betting technology, generally.
Whereas SatoshiDICE was ​somewhat decentralised, vDice is fully decentralised.
vDice leverages the power of Ethereum smart contracts to build a game that has no
server architecture. Instead, bets are processed through an Oracle, using the 3rd party
services of random.org for the random number source.
To play, a user sends a Tx to a contract. Then the contract executes the oracle contract.
The oracle then calls the contract back. So there are two transactions to a contract for
every bet made: one is the user, the second is the oracle.
There is also the option for users to contribute Ether (ETH) to each betting contract. In
this way users can share in the success of a specific contract and increase the house.
The Smart Contracts are live, network tested, and processing bets on a continuous basis.
3. The Crowdsale Object: ‘vSlice’ Token
The object of this Crowdsale is the native token of the vDice game called; ‘vSlice’.
This token is tied directly the the profits of the vDice game. Holders of vSlice tokens
receive a share of vDice profit, proportional to the amount of tokens held, in a fair and
transparent way.
‘vSlice’ tokens behave as any standard ERC20 token.
People participate in the Crowdsale using BTC or ETH. It will all be resolved to Ether
(ETH) and the Ethereum blockchain.
The issuance will last 4 weeks, starting November 15th, 2016 and ending December
15th, 2016.
The ‘vSlice’ token Smart Contract will be deployed and people who contribute will
receive:

-

Week 1 = 1 : 130
Week 2 = 1 : 120
Weeks 3 & 4 = 1 : 100

for each Ether (ETH) they send, for the 1-month of the issuance. So, for example; 100
ETH will get 13,000 vSlice tokens, up until the cap of 700,000 ETH. There is also a small
pre-allocation of tokens at lower rate of 1 : 100 , up to 50K ETH limit, giving a total of
5M ‘vSlice’.
Therefore, as a meta-token on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, the vSlice token has a
maximum possible coin supply of 96M vSlice.
The Crowdsale Smart Contract is fully decentralised. That is, the sending of Ether (ETH)
to the Token Smart Contract will result in the immediate, and decentralised, issuance of
the contributors vSlice tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
As soon as they are issued, accrued profits from the game are available.
4. Crowdsale Technical Design
For the full technical specifications of the Crowdsale Smart Contracts, ‘vSlice’ tokens and
distribution, please see Section I of this document.
5. Fund Utilization and Roadmap
All funds raised in this crowdsale shall be allocated for the development and marketing of
the vDice platform and project. H
​ ere​ is a full analysis of the business, operations and
plan for the use of funds.
The project will continue to push the limits of on-blockchain transaction processing; fully
decentralized and through an oracle. In a broader sense vDice exists to see how fast and
cost efficient it is possible to get on-blockchain transactions, through an oracle, using
Ethereum Smart Contracts.
The full vDice development roadmap document is presented ​here​. The development
roadmap as a visual graphic can be found ​here​.
vDice will publish the accounting of funds every 6-months, on the Ethereum blockchain.
This timing may be advanced or delayed when in special times.
6. How to Participate
Participants should visit ​crowdsale.vdice.io​ during the crowdsale period; November 15th,
2016 until December 15th, 2016. You can participate using Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH).
7. Duration and Timing
This ICO lasts for 30 days. It will begin on November 15th, 2016 and terminate on
December 12th, 2016.
8. The vSlice Token Distribution
Anyone who wants to participate in the crowdsale should have Ether (ETH) held in any
wallet: Ethereum Wallet, Mist, Parity UI, MyEtherWallet, Jaxx, Metamask, etc.

Once they have an Ethereum account with Ether (ETH), they simply need to send a
transaction with a special gas amount (it will be approx. 30,000-40,000 Gas) to the
‘vSlice’ address, as displayed on the website.
The transaction will immediately create an equivalent amount of ‘vSlice’ tokens, with an
exchange rate of:
- Week 1 = 1 : 130
- Week 2 = 1 : 120
- Weeks 3 & 4 = 1 : 100
in the token contract, without any other user interaction.
Once the transaction has been confirmed you will see your token amount on the
Ethereum Blockchain, and viewable through web-UI on the Crowdsale website.
Participants of this Crowdsale may sell ‘vSlice’ tokens as soon as they receive them, or
hold ‘vSlice’ for a longer term. The ‘vSlice’ belong to the owners.
9. Smart Contract Security
The game vDice is based on Ethereum Smart Contract (DAPP) technology. This has been
built using open source technology by the vDice team.
The vDice game code has been audited by leading blockchain technologists. Full audits of
the vDice game Smart Contract is available ​here​.
The Crowdsale too is based on Ethereum Smart Contract technology, according to
industry standards. The full specification of the Smart Contract code for the Crowdsale
and token issuance is ​here​.

10. Disclaimer
vSlice is the native token of the vDice blockchain Dapp. It is not or cannot be deemed to
be any kind of equities of any real-world company. This Initial Crowd-Offering is about
products, not equities. The blockchain industry is a new industry and may contain
technological, policy and market risks.

V2.0 - April 3, 2017

VIVA White Paper

April 3, 2017

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Problem
Technological innovation and global marketplaces have tangible benefits. However, they
also both contribute to the ever-increasing chasm of inequality within our society.
Unless the deeply felt concerns of those being left behind are adequately addressed, as a
whole we will continue to suffer under the burden of increasing strife and conflict.

The Opportunity
The VIVA project recognizes that an extremely inefficient and top-heavy financial system
is playing a significant role in aggravating the inequalities inherent in our society. This,
however, does not have to be the case. By implementing a streamlined virtual economy
that harnesses the power of digital currencies, blockchain ledgers and real world value
sources we are implementing a complete financial system, unchained to the political
vagaries of any specific nation, that is capable of providing significant recurring income
for all of the individuals that participate.

The Solution
In today's financial system every transaction is like opening and closing a leaky faucet.
Inevitably, value is lost - usually into the pockets of corporate financiers. In the
VIVAconomy™ each and every drop of value is recovered and equitably returned to the
individual people, Vivos™, who participate in the VIVAconomy. We have combined a
three-tiered stabilized digital currency framework, an online blockchain trading
exchange, a proven digital currency ATM network and real world value generating
blockchain applications to form the world's first sustainable virtual economy.

The Strategy
Until now cryptocurrencies have remained somewhat on the fringe due to three
principal handicaps: their volatility, the difficulties of being accepted “in the real world”
and their inability to offer a clear value proposition to the public at large. The
VIVAconomy solves all three of these problems.
First of all, our stabilized three-tier digital currency framework assures that VIVAcoins™
will freely fluctuate within a stable range of values. Second, our ATM network, which has
been operating for over a year, and the agreements we have in place with a reliable
Mastercard provider, make it easy for people to combine their activities in the
VIVAconomy with the traditional financial system. Lastly, the business applications that
we are implementing guarantee a consistent influx of value into the VIVAconomy.

The Offering
At this time we are seeding the VIVAconomy by offering the first and only widely
available ICO for our Tier-1 VIVA Crown™ coin. Each VIVA Crown coin grants the owner
the right to mint VIVAcoins within the VIVAconomy. It also grants them full voting rights
within the Crown Holders as outlined in this report. Only 10,500 VIVA Crown coins have
been issued, of which 6,500 are available for the ICO.

The VIVAconomy and Society
The Why
We believe that the VIVAconomy™ can significantly improve the lives of
billions of people all around the world.
As technological advances in automation and robotics increasingly reduce
the need for unskilled labor, billions of human beings are facing the harsh
reality that their position in society is slowly eroding away. In America this is
producing an epidemic of despair related disease, financial loss and a heavy
toll on our social safety net, while in other areas of the world the same forces
are leading to poverty and malnutrition.
Meanwhile, our financial system, based on nineteenth century paradigms
and power structures, feeds off of every transaction that occurs.
In the VIVAconomy, thanks to the streamlining of the system, these
transactional costs are instead employed to provide two essential functions
to every Vivo™: a stable recurring revenue stream and a participatory share
in a long-term financial asset that can help guarantee a sustainable
retirement.

The How
Each participant in the VIVAconomy (Vivo) has two VIVAcoin™ accounts
provisioned inside their VIVA wallet. First they have a VIVA current account
which is analogous to a checking account. Funds from your current account

can be spent at businesses that accept VIVAcoin, withdrawn from a VIVA
ATM or by using a connected Mastercard debit card. Second, each Vivo has a
participation in the VIVA Liquidity pool. This VIVA liquidity pool account is
analogous to a savings or retirement account and accrues dividends over
time. Vivos can pass funds between the two accounts.

VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 4

But where do the VIVAcoins come from?
Every transaction that occurs in the VIVAconomy generates a dividend
that is partially returned to each and every Vivo based on their
participation in the VIVA Liquidity pool. This means that the more you
save, the greater the dividends that you will receive.
Individual Vivos can earn VIVAcoins in several different ways. The
simplest way is to install a worker program on their computer. This
process cedes unused computational, storage and network resources to
the VIVA network in exchange for VIVAcoins. These resources are then
sold to businesses that need economical computing resources.
Vivos will also be able to earn VIVAcoins by participating in the VIVA
social network that we will be launching. By publishing content, engaging
and voting for content the Vivo demonstrates his or her humanity and in
exchange receives VIVAcoins.
Over the upcoming months we will be launching a series of powerful new
blockchain applications that will allow Vivos to earn VIVAcoins.

The How Much
How much can a Vivo earn?
This is a complicated question to answer. Our goal is to reach the point
where each Vivo is able to receive a sustainable living wage thanks to his
or her participation in the VIVAconomy.
Obviously, this will take time and effort and will depend on a number of
critical factors:
1. How many Vivos are participating in the VIVAconomy.

WHEN WILL THIS BE
REAL?
IT ALREADY IS!

2. How many transactions are occurring in the VIVAconomy.
For this reason every participant in the system has a vested interest in
seeing it flourish and prosper. The more transactions that are processed
in VIVAcoin the more everyone in the economy receives.
Similarly, as we onboard new business applications that harness the
VIVAconomy infrastructure, the more influx of outside currencies we will
see. This will also generate more dividends.

The When
When will this begin to be real? It already is!
With the ICO of the Tier-1 VIVA Crown coins the fundamental
architecture of the system will begin to operate.
The Tradeqwik™ Exchange is already operative in beta.
The ATM Network has been functioning successfully in two physical locations for over a
year. The agreement with a reliable Mastercard provider is in place.

VIVAconomy Technical Summary
The VIVAconomy is an enterprise level blockchain ecosystem
with its own unique cryptocurrency layers. We have designed
it to be the first “open, market-driven currency.” Unlike other
cryptocurrency projects the strength of the ecosystem
depends on the efficiency of the entire system instead of the
popularity of the coins.
By combining the best ideas from the financial and
blockchain sectors, we have been able to implement a
streamlined economic engine that equitably returns
dividends to all participants.
The strength of the
ecosystem depends on
the efficiency of the
entire system instead of
the popularity of the
coins.

The VIVAconomy has a custom-built exchange and
cryptocurrency gateway called Tradeqwik. Here consumers,
businesses, and professionals can exchange cryptocurrencies
for traditional fiat currencies or other stores of value. Unique
features of this blockchain powered exchange include
lending, saving and margin. TradeQwik is already live and in
beta. See www.Tradeqwik.com
The VIVAconomy also provides the infrastructure for a global
peer-to-peer network to offer compute, storage and
networking features. It is designed to evolve and offer
additional services targeted to the financial, healthcare and
manufacturing sectors as well as small business merchant
processing services.
The custom VIVA wallet is built with the highest levels of
cryptography. The wallet also serves as money transfer
remittance platform.
The core VIVA platform will also serve as a peer-to-peer
blockchain marketplace and social media content
management platform. Vivos receive VIVAcoins for both their

VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 6

computer processing power on the network as well as
creative content on the social media platform. The
VIVAconomy has a built in retirement account for all Vivos
that pays daily compounded dividends.
Finally, the VIVA system includes deploying custom ATMs.
The first two VIVA multi-coin ATMs are installed and
operating in our Baja Mexico test region. The first one is in
downtown Tijuana at the Imaxess medical hospital, and the
other is in the La Fonda Hotel and Restaurant. Both ATMs
dispense the local fiat...Mexican pesos.

Benefits of the VIVAconomy
Bitcoin taught us that there is great value in being able to
move money without interference by corporate and political
interests.
However, the VIVAconomy goes far beyond that. In fact, it is a
whole new way of looking at money.
At its core is a cryptocurrency that recognizes money as just
another form of energy.
Money is just economic energy. When it's not put to useful
work, it rapidly loses power. Put another way, the only value
that money really has, is what you can buy with it. Unlike
other cryptocurrencies you may have considered investing in,
the VIVAconomy by definition has real world uses and users,
not just speculative “use cases”.

Like other forms of
energy, money must
be put to useful work in
order to be a
sustainable container
of value.

If the VIVAconomy includes a global distributed network
providing on demand, storage, compute and networking
services, what makes it different from other projects that
provide similar services?
For each of the coins that provide compute, storage or
network services, this is the ONLY thing that they do. The
buck stops there for those coins. As the value of these
services decline, so will these so called “currencies”. For the
VIVAconomy, these are just the first of a series of real world
applications that will provide a genuine influx of value into
the VIVAconomy.
For example, our system looks at the market completely
differently than say Filecoin, or Golem. The VIVA ecosystem is
already engineered to evolve far beyond those services and in
fact, the primary end users of VIVA are not going to be your
typical person seeking those services. Instead, businesses are
incentivized to connect to and leverage the power of the
VIVA network, and in most instances, function as resellers for
specific niches. VIVA is seamless and transparent to the end
VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 7

user.
More importantly, the VIVAconomy is designed to be
appealing and useful to the general public. With an exchange,
wallet, easy on-boarding as a worker node, savings account
with daily dividends, social networking platform that pays
users for content, and gateway to fiat currency, VIVA is
positioned to make the cryptocurrency crossover to the
general public and create a whole new economic engine
placing the people at the center of governance.
Unlike other projects,
we do not mine coins, in
the VIVAconomy we
mint coins.

The VIVAconomy's economic engine is made up of five key
components: VIVA Crowns, VIVA Coins, vX , the VIVA
Liquidity Pool and the Tradeqwik exchange.
Unlike other projects, we do not mine coins, instead in the
VIVAconomy we mint coins.
The five fundamental components within the VIVA system
interact in a way that creates a global economic system that
is sustainable, valuable, robust, and most importantly,
stable.
The second tier VIVAcoin supply is directly impacted by
price, or more precisely, by its purchasing power parity. If the
price is too high, the supply increases in response,
conversely if the price is too low then the supply will respond
by contracting in order to bring the price back into range.
This is managed by the VIVA Crown Holders.
VIVA Crowns are the tool we use to help ensure the price
stability of the VIVAcoin currency. Each VIVA Crown holds a
Treasury Right to mint a set supply of VIVAcoins each week
that is determined by the consensus of all Crown Holders. So
by purchasing a VIVA Crown, you are purchasing the ability
to create a Treasury Right and basically a license to print an
allocated amount of VIVA coins each quarter.

There is no other
currency that operates
in this way anywhere in
the world.

There is no other currency that operates in this way
anywhere in the world.
However, the oil market is comparable. Oil prices are partially
driven by the collective pricing decisions of OPEC member
nations, who execute a similar function. When the price of oil
is too low, OPEC nations agree to cut production in order to
to raise the price and when the price is too high, OPEC
nations increase production in response.
The US Federal Reserve system also functions in a similar
manner to VIVA.

VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 8

The Fed sets a number of rates including the T-Bill rate and
the “window rate”. These rates help to control the supply of
US Dollars. When the T-Bill rate is high, money exits the
economy as people dump their riskier investments for safer
Treasury Bills. The “window rate”, which is what the banks
pay to the fed to borrow money overnight, is a closer
comparison to how VIVA works, because the more money
that banks have to pay to borrow money, the more actively
they seek out cheaper sources of currency including the
open forex markets.
Each of these scenarios are functionally similar to VIVA,
because VIVA does not operate in a vacuum. However, it is
important to note that this isn't rule by decree.
While it may at first appear that Crown Holders collectively
form another cartel, it is actually just the opposite.
Crown Holders, set their own pricing and are welcome to sell
at any price they care to. Crown Holders set their desired
price, but the pricing target enforced by the network is the
mean average of Crown Holder pricing requests after lopping
off the top and bottom in order to eliminate outliers.
In this way an optimum balance is struck between competing
interests and VIVA’s energy is directed towards where it can
be the most effective, while not cutting anyone out of the
bargain completely.

When you are
planning on using a
currency to put food on
the table, the very last
thing you want is for it
to be exciting.

As a final backstop to cartel style tyranny, anyone can
become a Crown Holder either by mining a Crown or by
purchasing them on the open market. There are no
requirements to becoming a Crown Holder, other than simply
owning one or more VIVA Crowns.
This three-tiered system achieves a goal that has plagued all
other cryptocurrencies to date - namely their volatility.
When you are planning on using a currency to put food on
the table, the very last thing you want is for it to be exciting.
Instead of an ecosystem designed to facilitate financial
speculation, we have designed the VIVAconomy as a stable
place that derives its value from the efficiency of transacting
instead of the wild swings of a speculative market.

VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

A Three-Tiered Stabilized Digital
Currency Framework
Until now all digital cryptocurrencies have suffered from
extreme volatility. Since they operate on the fringe of the
financial system, they have traditionally been subject to
very strong speculative forces.
This volatility has contributed significantly to their
reputations as “risky investments.”

Volatility has plagued
the cryptocurrency
world making it seem
risky.

To solve this problem, the VIVAconomy™ is scaffolded
around three digital currencies: VIVA Crowns™, vX and
VIVAcoins™.
Like the heavy counterweight at the foot of a tall crane,
VIVA Crowns provide the VIVAconomy with the stability
needed to be perceived as a reliable, safe place for Vivos™
to store value.
vX are integrated financial instruments that allow any Vivo
to store value pegged to a specific amount of external
currency. For example 1 vUSD is the number of VIVAcoins
equivalent to $1 USD. The vX are redeemable at their face
value in the specified currency at any time regardless of the
fluctuations of the value of VIVAcoins.
VIVAcoins, the third tier currency in the VIVAconomy, is the
primary operating currency within the system. All
transactions are settled in VIVAcoin which means that
these are the coins that businesses and people will use in
their daily lives.
To accomplish this in the VIVAconomy, the owners of VIVA
Crowns collectively play a very significant role. Their duty
is to regulate the supply of VIVAcoins so

VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 10

that the market price stays within an agreed upon range. If
demand is high, Crown Holders will mint new VIVAcoins to
assure that the price does not skyrocket. Similarly, if the
price is falling below the desired range, Crown Holders will
collectively reduce the supply of VIVAcoins in the market,
thus bringing the price back up.
This vital regulating process, which is controlled by an open,
democratic and transparent VIVA Crown Holders is the key
to providing longterm financial stability to the entire
universe of Vivos.
As mentioned in the introduction, VIVA currency is an “open
market driven coin”. This means that it trades against
numerous crypto and fiat pairs in an open and free market.
This allows easy transitioning into and out of the currency.
As long as the price is +-10% of the current target, the
currency trades freely and the network will not interfere.
However, if the price rises above 10% of the target or falls
below 10% of the target, then and only then does the network
take corrective action.
In the event the price is too high, the network will implement
a negative interest rate. This negative interest can be thought
of as a bonus, allowing more VIVAcoins to be minted as is
needed in order to drive the price of VIVAcoin within the
target range.
If the price is too low, then the network will implement a
positive interest which could even go above 100% in order to
mint a reduced, or in some limited cases, even a negative
amount of VIVAcoin and mop up the excess liquidity.
The VIVAconomy also has other mechanisms in place to
contract supplies and keep the price within targets. One of
these is a “fee burning” mechanism wherein the network fees
are burned. Freshly minted VIVAcoins which do not move,
and sit unused for over a year are deleted.
Similarly, formerly active VIVAcoins which have sat inactive
and unused for over five years are removed from the system.
This does not occur if the VIVAcoins have been put to work
as vX or staked into the Liquidity Pool.
VIVAcoins are money that must be spent, must be used,
because money is only worth whatever you can buy with it.
Crown Holders collectively determine how much VIVAcoin
will circulate by setting a target price and a target market
cap. This happens once a week and once it is set, the Crown
Holder can issue Treasury Rights (TRs) and sell or even rent
them. TRs can only be “called” or “executed” by mints, which
VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 11

then use them to pay worker nodes and other expenses.
These expenses are settled directly in VIVAcoin.
You’ll notice that at no time do we allow the coin to dump
recklessly into the market. If a Crown Holder chooses not to
issue a Treasury, then an amount of VIVAcoin equivalent to a
Treasury right allotment is credited to their liquidity pool
account, thus building a buffer or reserve of currency. This is
important because there may be times where all TRs are
minting negative amounts of coin in order to meet pricing
targets and a negative minting Treasury deducts coins from
the liquidity pool balance of the Crown Holder.
If VIVAcoin were a typical cryptocurrency with regular
mining pools, this would be financially devastating. But in
the VIVAconomy, each mint must be attached to a business
activity.
As a business activity, this negative minting period is just a
cost of doing business. The buffer that the Crown Holder
builds up from not exercising or selling their TRs, helps to
offset these periods.
In truth negative minting is the most expensive way for a
business to acquire coin. It has limited utility, i.e. it can only
be used to cover existing miners on existing contracts. The
fee is significant and this fee is being burned in order to pull
excess coins off the market. It is wiser for someone who is
currently negative minting, to purchase the coins it needs on
the open market rather than try to mint them. This is
because the only time negative minting occurs, is during
times when the price has been below targets for an extended
period of time, meaning that the coins are under priced in
the first place.
This can be enforced with smart contracts which can be
attached to TRs, causing the business to buy VIVAcoin on the
open market automatically during periods of negative
minting, thereby preserving crown holder reserves.
In this way, we ensure that the people contributing
resources to the VIVAconomy, are always able to cash out
their earnings without fear of being caught in a slide. In
other words, we ensure price stability for the people who
need it most.
Likewise, all of this is a HUGE boon for speculators. We fully
expect VIVAcoin to become the world’s most actively traded
currency by speculators and have built the TradeQwik
exchange specifically for speculators and market makers.
VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 12

VIVA Crowns, Treasury Rights and Crown Holders
VIVA Crowns™ are the tool we use to help ensure the price
stability of the VIVAcoin currency.
Crowns are extremely scarce, only a limited supply will be
sold during the ICO. After the ICO, only one Crown is
created per week.
The total number of Crowns that will ever be minted is
42,000.
This scarcity serves two fundamental purposes. First, given
that VIVA Crowns are very hard to come by, Crown Holders
will be very reluctant to sell them. This is a secondary
stability guarantee for the VIVAconomy as a whole. Second,
this assures that the Crown Holders will not become
unwieldy and ungovernable.
Treasury Rights, TRs or simply Treasuries, are a literal
license to print money in the VIVAconomy. Each VIVA
Crown holds a Treasury Right to mint a set supply of
VIVAcoins each week that is determined by the consensus
of all Crown Holders.

The total number of
VIVA Crowns that will
ever be created is
42,000.

By purchasing a VIVA Crown in our ICO, you are purchasing
the ability to create a Treasury Right and thus a license to
print an allocated amount of VIVAcoins each week. This
Treasury Right can be assigned, rented or sold to a mint.
TRs are time limited, over a span of 90 days. During that 90
days owners are entitled to mint one Crown’s worth of
VIVAcoins which can be used for any business purpose.
For example, if there are 100 TRs in action and you owned
10 of them, you would have the authority to mint 10% of all
the VIVAcoins during that time period.
VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 13

However, the value of a VIVA Crown goes way beyond just
the ability to mint new VIVAcoins.
Crown Holders have enormous say in the fundamental
operating parameters of the VIVAconomy. In the above
example, you would also have 10% of the voting rights for
each decision that the VIVA Crown Holders makes.
These decisions include establishing the desired price
range for VIVAcoins and the actions taken to assure that
the currency remains within the desired range.
This differs from proof of stake in that all you need to do,
to direct the energy of the VIVAconomy towards your
goals, is to acquire a handful of Crowns, vs the need to
acquire untold millions of a proof of stake coin.

VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 14

VIVA Coins and Mints
VIVAcoins™ are the primary currency within the VIVAconomy.
They are also the settlement layer for the VIVA blockchain
engine.
In the VIVAconomy, VIVAcoins are not mined. Instead, they are
minted by an authorized VIVA mint. A mint is the VIVAconomy's
equivalent of a mining pool. In our system we don’t use proof of
stake, or proof of work. Instead, we utilize “proof of authority” to
generate new currency. This authority comes from ownership of
a Treasury Right, aka TR.
VIVAcoins are the
primary currency within
the VIVAconomy.

Every Mint must have a Treasury Right to operate and is
required to be connected to a business activity to operate. This
business will leverage the VIVA network by using and paying for
it’s competitively priced infrastructure. The Treasury Right can
also be leased out to businesses for an interest payment if the
Crown Holder chooses not to run their own business.
The reasoning behind this structure is to assure that the
VIVAcoin is relatively price stable. It isn’t pegged per se, but it
does orbit a value. This value is set by the Crown Holders, and is
presently set at $5.30 USD per VIVAcoin.
Why $5.30?
This figure was selected as a starting value because it is the
average amount of money earned per hour by an average person
living in a first world economy. It was derived by dividing the
average annual household family income by the annual
household size and then dividing it by 24 hrs in a day, 7 days a
week and 52 weeks in a year.
We expect it to stay around this value, but Crown Holders are
welcome to change this value to whatever they believe is fair
market utilizing their votes.

vX The World's Most Boring Electronic
Cash System
The VIVAconomy is not an isolated economy separated from the rest
of the world. Quite to the contrary, it is best to think about it as a
parallel economy that is tightly linked to rest of the world's financial
systems.
After all, the entire VIVAconomy would be useless if you can't easily
walk in to your neighborhood supermarket and exchange your
VIVAcoins for a loaf of bread or a bottle of wine. Remember, money
is only as valuable as its ability to be used to purchase goods and
services.
To achieve this level of utility, the VIVAconomy needs easy ways to
connect to the daily lives of all Vivos. For this we rely on vX™.
Simply put, vX are instruments that are always worth X of VIVA.
X here can mean anything we can establish a price feed for. vUSD for
USD, vMXN for Mexican Pesos, even vXAU for mg’s of gold.

vX remain as
anonymous as cash,
because they are cash.

While this may sound complicated, the important thing to
understand is that if you receive vX, then no matter what the market
is doing you will always have your purchasing power. If VIVAcoin
climbs in value, you miss out on the appreciation, but if it falls in
value you miss out on that as well.
A vX is a simple way to park value in an external value store.
Technically, vX are demand draft instruments controlling an amount
of VIVA equivalent to the current market spot 1:1. They pay a variable
interest rate as long as you choose to hold them and like cash, they
are completely anonymous.
You can send vX to anyone at any time. Every mint can create them
when they need to raise funds and every mint must accept them at face
VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 16

value, including TradeQwik.
But how does vX remain anonymous just like cash?

When a mint
publishes a list of active
vX notes, anyone may
purchase those notes.

Nothing ever transits the VIVA ledger except VIVAcoin. Mints
publish a list of active vX notes that they have issued. These
notes contain serial numbers, but the serial numbers are in
fact, public key hashes.
To facilitate transaction processing, the VIVA network has a
built in mail and messaging system. This messaging system is
completely anonymous and encrypted, no one except the
sender and receiver can see the source, destination or
contents of any message unless they specifically release that
info.
No actor in the network can know the contents of any
message. This is valuable because it allows the message
system to function as a sealed envelope.
When a mint publishes a list of active vX notes, anyone may
purchase those notes.
The mint then completes the purchase by signing the note
with their private key and stapling the corresponding public
key to the note.
Knowledge of the public key and a copy of the signature is
sufficient to establish ownership of the note, so the
purchaser can simply open the envelope and send it to
another recipient. This can carry on as many times as
necessary until someone decides to claim the cash inside.
When this occurs they redeem it at their mint. The receiving
mint will issue them new vX and redeem the old one from
the originating mint.
At first glance this would seem to be vulnerable to a double
spend attack. There is after all, no chain of custody and each
re-mailing increases the risk that some party will try to send
to multiple parties.
To prevent this, the highest priority message in the network
is the “redeem” message.
When a person claims their vX with their mint, the mint
immediately sends out a high priority “redeemed” message.
At this point, everyone in the network knows what mint that
currency was redeemed at, but not who redeemed it. They
also know what mint the currency was created at, but not
who the purchaser is. Furthermore, they have no way of
knowing how many hands it has passed through since the list
is only published once a week and the mint

VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 17

will generally send the oldest notes first in order to clear
their books of the asset.
From this point, the issuing mint broadcasts a “redeem
completed” message.
This redeem completed signal cancels the old note
completely and sets up a liability (a debt) that must be
settled at the next block between the two mints. This
liability is denominated in VIVAcoin and is spot market at
the time of redemption.
This gives each mint up to 7 days to settle, but in a healthy
ecosystem, this will generally be a wash between the mints
as they redeem each other’s vX.
For Vivos, what is important to note is that by converting
VIVAcoin into vX in their local currency, they are effectively
isolating their money from the ups and downs of the
VIVAcoin currency market. Their Mastercard debit card,
which can be used anywhere Mastercard is accepted,
simply subtracts from their vX balance.
For people living in countries where the local currency is
very volatile, the incentive will be to leave their funds in
VIVAcoin, which is inherently more stable, and then convert
to vX only when they need to make a withdrawal.

The TradeQwik Exchange
TradeQwik™, is the VIVA network’s own exchange*. *It was
designed to allow speculators to make significant profits by
trading into and out of VIVA, which helps prevent the coin
from being dumped on the open market like almost every
other digital currency.
The TradeQwik exchange is where the VIVAconomy interacts
with the traditional financial system. As such, you can send
your vX to your TradeQwik account and cash them out at
any VIVA ATM, or just send them to your debit Mastercard
and spend them anywhere. You can even use it to pay taxes.
So what are the odds we’re going to be able to get Vivos to
think in VIVAcoin terms?
We don’t expect
individuals to deal in
VIVAcoin ever.

Precisely zero. Not a chance. Zilch. Nada.
And this is just fine.
In fact, this is where every single cryptocurrency begins to
fall down, even Bitcoin.
Every currency, not just cryptocurrency, hopes it will be THE
reserve currency that people turn to for their daily
transactions. But at the end of the day, money is only worth
what you can pay for with it, and the inescapable truth is
that governments want you to pay taxes in their local
currency. With vX this is easy and transparent.
This is the point where the rubber meets the road. People
think in terms of dollars, euros, pesos, or whatever is the
standard currency in the region where they live. If your taxes
are in Euros it doesn’t help you one bit to try and pay it in
dollars. Unless you are traveling on vacation, most people
never even consider that their money is a variable asset.
Many cryptocurrencies dance around this fact.
Many have hopes that their currency might become a
national or even global currency. This

VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 19

however, is highly unlikely. Political regimes are slow to
change, and when they do, it’s much more likely to be to an
Ecuadorian situation where they adopt the basic concepts
of blockchain technology and crypto currency, but create
their own regulated and controlled currency backed by the
good faith and credit of their government.
This makes perfect sense to all but the most hardened
crypto anarchists, yet it’s the place where every other
crypto except VIVAcoin drops the ball.

VIVA takes a different approach.
We don’t expect individuals to deal in VIVAcoin ever unless
they so desire. Yes, VIVAcoin is THE only unit of settlement
on the VIVA network, and yes it trades and floats relatively
freely which is exciting if you’re a speculator.
But consider this. If you’re just using it for daily financial
transactions, you DO NOT want your money to be exciting!
To the contrary, you want it to be nice and boring.
You want to know that if you have $1 USD in purchasing
power parity today, you will always have $1USD in
purchasing power parity, no matter when you decide to go
spend it.
That is the beauty of the vX instrument we have explained
earlier.
The Tradeqwik Exchange makes all of these conversions
easy and simple. For the advanced currency trader it
provides the ability to leverage complex instruments like
lending and margins. However, for the normal everyday
Vivo it simply facilitates the movement between the
VIVAconomy and the rest of the world.
Even better, every transaction that occurs on the
Tradeqwik Exchange generates value which benefits
equitably every member of the VIVAconomy.

VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

The VIVA Liquidity Pool
As explained earlier, when a Vivo signs up to be a member
of the VIVAconomy, he or she will be provisioned with two
accounts - a VIVA current account and a VIVA liquidity pool
account.
The VIVA current account is used for immediate spending
while the VIVA liquidity pool account is for longterm
savings. The sum of all the VIVA liquidity accounts of all
Vivos comprises the global VIVA Liquidity Pool.
Every transaction
generates value which
benefits equitably every
Vivo.

For an economic engine to be successful it must be strong,
robust and sustainable over the long haul. The VIVAconomy
is designed with four distinct components that work
together to achieve this stability and dependability:
VIVAcoins, vX, the VIVA Liquidity Pool and VIVA Crowns.
The liquidity pool is funded entirely by individual Vivos and
acts as the people's voice in the VIVAconomy.
All VIVAcoins that are minted in the VIVAconomy are first
borrowed from the global liquidity pool.
The liquidity pool charges the mints interest for this and
maintains a spread between what it charges in interest and
what it pays in dividends.
This spread is split into three parts:

• 50% to liquidity pool participants as a dividend
• 25% to the VIVA Awards Committee
• 25% to the VIVA Social Media Platform.
Dividends
The first 50% of the spread is immediately paid
proportionally as a dividend to each Vivo
VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 21

in the liquidity pool. If your account is in compounding mode,
this is used to acquire more stake in the pool, otherwise it's
credited directly to your current account in your wallet to spend
as you wish.
The Fundamental Purpose of the VIVA Liquidity Pool
It is important to note that the principle purpose of the VIVA
Liquidity Pool is to provide each and every Vivo a longterm
financial asset that can guarantee them a sustainable living wage.
A Vivo's liquidity pool account can be set to one of two modes:
compounding mode and withdrawal mode.
When in compounding mode all dividends and awards are used
to increase the Vivo's stake in the global liquidity pool. Like a
traditional retirement account, this balance is compounded daily
and with time will convert itself into a sizable asset.
When in withdrawal mode dividends are directly deposited into
the Vivo's current account along with a target daily income. This
money can and should be spent.
For example, our present target is $5.30 per hr. Or 24 VIVAcoins
per day.
Dividends in retirement mode are paid first and then your
account is drawn by the remainder.
In this way you always have an income you can rely on and
basically everyone sees about the same amount daily for life
if they've been compounding for 10 years or more.
If the dividends exceed the target then they are used to buy
back into the LP to offset future dry spells.
This target amount is set once a week by Crown Holders.
This works out to about $127.20 per day and you get this so long
as you are active in the system and it pays daily until your
liquidity pool balance is too low to support you anymore.
The reason for using this system is to give Vivos a useful amount
of money daily without making anyone uber rich. Also it
dramatically reduces any incentive for hoarding since 10 years of
daily compounding on a couple of dollars daily should net about
a 30 year draw down.
This works out to $3862/mo or $46.3k annually.
It is important to note that no one can instantly cash out their
stake in the liquidity pool. This rule makes sure that the overall
stability of the VIVAconomy is secure and that no single player or
group of players can undermine the viability of the entire system.

The VIVA Award Pool and Award
Rights
The second 25% of the interest spread that is paid when a mint
creates VIVAcoins is deposited into the VIVA Awards Pool
which is administered by the VIVA Awards Committee. This
committee's function is to make grants to individuals and
causes that will benefit the most. The award goes directly into
the individual's pool account and like all pool funds, it pays
dividends for life.
This could easily be a life changing amount of money.
Every 90 days, Crown Holders can perform these actions for
each Crown they own:
1. Sell (rent out) a Treasury Right (TR) to a mint, or sink a TR
into the liquidity pool (thereby purchasing additional
ownership stake in the pool).
2. Give an Award Right (AR) to any VIVA user.
TRs and ARs can be used independently of each other, and
mixed in whatever measure is desired depending on how many
Crowns you have. For example, if a Crown Holder has 10
Crowns, she could choose to rent out 3 TRs, deposit 7 TRs in
the liquidity pool, and issue 4 ARs to deserving users, all for the
same 90 day period (not all ARs have to be used).
You are already familiar with TRs, but we haven't yet discussed
Award Rights.
Like TRs, an AR is good for a 90 day period and then it expires,
allowing you to issue another one. The purpose of ARs is to
allow Crown Holders to award people a potentially life
changing amount of money, above and beyond what simple
voting can accomplish.
VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 23

Is there an aspiring musician you just know would take off,
if she could just stop working 80 hours a week as a
waitress? Is there an artist you believe has the potential to
be the next Picasso? By issuing them an AR, and letting
other Crown Holders know so they can also issue ARs, the
beneficiary receives a jumpstart on escaping the daily grind
in order to pursue his or her true passions.
Sounds great in theory, but how does it work in practice?
This is where the VIVA Awards Pool comes into play.
As mentioned above, 25% of minting fees plus all unused
daily votes go to the awards pool, which stores them as
vUSD. This vUSD is allowed to accumulate over a 90 day
period. At the end of the 90 days, the pool is drained and all
the vUSD is converted back into an equivalent amount of
VIVAcoins and is distributed proportionally in the form of
liquidity pool stake to everyone who was granted an AR
during that particular 90 day period.
Then another 90 day period begins, with the awards pool
balance reset back to 0.
Note that at no time is the market being flooded with extra
VIVAcoins. All the coins in this process are destroyed in the
liquidity pool and only pool ownership is affected
accordingly.
The recipients of the ARs will then be able to claim
dividends for life in the usual manner, based on their
awarded liquidity pool stake.
Awards for each 90 day period are granted in a proportional
fashion depending on how many ARs an individual was
granted during that period vs. the total number of ARs
granted by Crown Holders.
For example, imagine that during a particular period,
500,000 vUSD accumulates in the awards pool, and Crown
Holders issue 100 ARs. Susie Soccermom, a single mother
with 2 kids, struggles to make ends meet and runs a worker
node for a business to generate some extra income on the
side. She's also an aspiring science blogger, but doesn't have
enough time to write frequently.
Some of her friends, who are also the Crown Holders that
introduced her to VIVA in the first place, decide to help her
out. Collectively they issue her 5 ARs.
As a total of 100 ARs have been granted for this period, each
AR is worth 1% of the awards pool which is 500,000 vUSD.
Thus, Susie's stake in the liquidity pool will increase by
VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 24

$25,000 worth of VIVAcoins, giving her quite a boost in
future dividends.
With the extra money she doesn't have to work as much
and can concentrate on her dream of becoming a
professional writer.
There are a few more subtle details to take note of:
1.Awards issued via ARs are capped at a maximum of 1%
ownership of the liquidity pool, to prevent ownership from
becoming unbalanced.
Crown Holders have
the right to grant award
rights.

2.If a 90 day period ends with no ARs being issued, the
ending balance of vUSD in the awards pool gets rolled
over to the next 90 day period (the awards continue to
build up until there is at least one person to claim them).
3.The cutoff for issuing ARs is 7 days before the end of the
awards period. This means people can't game the system
by sneaking in ARs at the last minute.

Award recipients see
their stake in the
liquidity pool grow.

4.If a Crown is currently in debt to the liquidity pool due
to negative interest, then the Crown Holder cannot issue
any ARs. However, a Crown Holder with negative stake can
still be an awards recipient; in this case the award
received will first be used to pay off the debt to the
liquidity pool and boost the recipient's stake into positive
territory again.
What if I'm too busy to find worthy AR candidates?
A Crown Holder can designate any VIVA user as a proxy to
hand out your ARs for you.
It's easy to imagine a whole cottage industry springing up,
centered around professional philanthropic scouts
dedicated to searching out & vetting candidates for
awards on behalf of the Crown Holders.
It is also important to note that by crediting a recipient's
liquidity pool account, it gives the recipient an incentive
to remain in the VIVAconomy.

The VIVA Paid Social Media Platform
The third and final 25% of the interest payment spread is used to
fund the creative and fun part of the VIVAconomy, the VIVA Paid
Social Media Platform.
This is where the party happens!
On this platform Vivos create and publish content like articles,
videos, poetry, music, memes, films, art, novels, and even science
experiments. Vivos vote for content and other Vivos that they
like. And the really cool part? Each vote you receive is worth
exactly 1 vUSD = $1!
You can earn from votes indefinitely, you never age out of the
system, and people can vote for you as many times as they care
to.

Voting allows you to
altruistically reward
other Vivos.

The VIVA Social Media Platform, however, is much more than just
a content creation and sharing platform. Vivos can vote for and
reward business activities as well. Are you an entrepreneur,
business owner, or charity organization? The VIVA network will
allow you to be rewarded through votes for the positive
contribution you make in the world!
The number of votes you get to *give* each day depends on your
slice of the global liquidity pool and how much 25% of the spread
amounts to for the day. This will be calculated daily and
displayed in your account dashboard.
Voting is similar in concept to the way you vote for posts on
Steemit to award post authors a chunk of the daily Steem
rewards allotment. But there are some key differences.
First, on Steemit users vote on specific pieces of content,
whereas on the VIVA platform votes are awarded to individual
Vivos instead. This means that you are able to vote for the totality
VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 26

of a Vivo's contributions to society instead of just specific pieces
of content.
Second, on the VIVA platform each vote is deposited daily into the
Vivo's liquidity pool account, increasing their stake in the overall
VIVAconomy.
Third, on Steemit users can vote as often as they like (with
diminishing effect for voting too frequently), while on the VIVA
Platform Vivos have a fixed number of votes per day, which is
determined by how much stake they have in the liquidity pool.
Fourth, on our platform each vote has the same dollar value,
which is set by the Crown Holders, instead of depending on the
past history of engagement.
Value in the
VIVAconomy is ever
wasted.

Voting on the VIVA Platform is a mechanism by which you can
reward other Vivos for any actions that you deem worthwhile. And
since you are voting for people, not specific content, applicability
of votes is much more general than Steemit.
Do you know someone who produces wonderful videos on
YouTube, runs a particularly reliable worker node for a business,
or helps provide liquidity to thin markets on TradeQwik? Then
toss a vote their way and show them their efforts are appreciated!
There will even be a VIVA browser plug-in so that when you vote
for a post on Steemit, you also vote for that user in VIVA if they
have registered their Steemit identity with VIVA. It's easy to
imagine similar plug-ins being developed for other social sites
such as YouTube, Reddit, etc.
A few important points:
All votes contribute to a user's liquidity pool account, meaning
that votes increase a person's percentage ownership of the
liquidity pool rather than being paid out directly in VIVA coins.
Votes are use-it-or-lose it. If you have 5 available votes per day
and only use 3 of them, then the 2 unused votes don't carry over
to the next day.
However, nothing in VIVA is wasted.
Those 2 unused votes leftover at the end of the day are sent to the
awards pool and will be distributed in the next awards
distribution.
When was the last time you were paid on Facebook for your time
and creative efforts?
Each and every day in the VIVAconomy, you have an opportunity
to earn dividends in three powerful ways: from your liquidity
account, from votes you receive from your peers
and from the awards committee!

Worker Nodes & The VIVA Computational Network
We all know money is power, and power is money.
With Airbnb, we were able to monetize our houses.

a

With Uber, we were able to monetize our cars.
Now with VIVA you can monetize your computer!
When you agree to cede unused computing resources from your
computer to the VIVA network, you are converting your computer
into a worker node. You can think of it as using your computer as an
employee that you put to work. All worker nodes receive their pay
directly into their VIVA liquidity pool account.
The VIVAconomy is a new economic engine that has been designed
to put power back into the hands of the people worldwide. Power
over their money, power over their economy, and most importantly
power over their lives and destinies.

With VIVA you can
monetize your
computer!

All of this power is easily harvested by utilizing the collective power
of our computers.
By simply adding a lightweight, backgrounded, and isolated
application to your computer, you have just turned it into an
employee in the VIVAconomy that constantly earns you money. The
application is isolated in its own container (separated away from
your personal data) and only utilizes unused computing resources
to solve complex calculations on the VIVA network, paying you for
your contributions.
When your computer is idle (or mostly idle from normal use), there
is a lot of wasted processing power that never gets used. The VIVA
network takes advantage of the unused resources on your computer
and puts it to work solving complex calculations, processing
transactions, and providing services to the VIVAconomy.
As easy and simple as this may sound, at the same time you become a
VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 28

hero. You are now part of creating the very thing that will give
power back to the people - their own economic engine.
This is the simplest way for you to become a part of VIVA.
For most people to earn and spend a dollar, knowledge of the
entire Federal Reserve and central banking system is
unnecessary, and the fact that they can earn and spend the
money is all that matters.
When you register your computer into the VIVAconomy, you
will be given an electronic wallet with two accounts: one for
immediate spending, and another account linked to the VIVA
liquidity pool. (The liquidity pool is a lifetime retirement
account that pays daily dividends.)
Once you are setup in VIVA, your computer will signal to the
network that it is available to complete tasks. These tasks
include retrieving data, storing data, and networking between
computers. (Remember, this is all done in the background with
no effort on your part.)
On the VIVA network, “Mints” will announce a task that needs
to be processed. If your computer is available to complete
tasks on the network, those mints can utilize your spare
computing resources and will automatically deposit VIVAcoins
into your wallet for each task completed.
To simplify and keep things streamlined, all transactions within
the system are done in VIVAcoins.
When you are ready to spend your money, the VIVA ecosystem
makes it easy.
By allowing you to send money, purchase goods and services,
etc. instantly from your VIVA wallet, transitioning your
VIVAcoins into the traditional economy is fast and easy.
First of all, VIVAcoins can be transferred to any individual or
business on the VIVA network. Need to send or receive
payments in another currency? You can easily convert
VIVAcoins to almost any other form of currency right within
your wallet via a built in exchange feature called TradeQwik.
From there, you can also load a VIVA issued Mastercard debit
card and spend your money anywhere Mastercards are
accepted.
You can also access your electronic wallet directly at VIVA
enabled ATM’s worldwide!

VIVA ATM and Remittance Network
The VIVAconomy does not intend to substitute the traditional
economy. Our goal is not to replace existing fiat or crypto
currencies. Instead, we work to build a streamlined, sustainable
parallel economy that makes life easier for every Vivo on the
planet.
For this reason, we have always understood that the gateways
between the VIVAconomy and the traditional economy are
essential to our success.
While the TradeQwik exchange is our first and primary gateway,
we harbor no delusions about the general public being
interested in a currency exchange system. After all, most people
want to use money to buy goods and services like bread and
doctor's appointments. Exchanging currencies is normally a
seldom used process when you're traveling abroad.
However, one group of normal citizens do, in fact, come into
contact with foreign currency exchange rates on a regular basis:
immigrants living abroad who help sustain their families back
home.
Often these people live and work on the bottom rungs of the
social ladder and are forced to pay through the nose for a
simple financial service. Companies like Western Union and
Moneygram charge exorbitant fees precisely because these
populations of people have little or no recourse.
The VIVA ATM and Remittance network solves this problem in a
uniquely powerful manner.
In the traditional financial system there are three steps in this
process where the consumer pays:

VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 30

1.

Converting the payee's currency into the local currency
back home.

2.

Transporting the funds from the payee's country to the
receiver's country.

3.

Withdrawing the funds in the receiver's country.

The VIVAconomy not only reduces all three, but it does so in a
way that benefits both the payee and the receiver as well as the
entire VIVAconomy!
Thanks to the second tier vX digital currency in the
VIVAconomy, the payee can simply convert his VIVAcoins into
the payee's currency within his or her own wallet. While this
transaction actually occurs on the TradeQwik Exchange, it is
transparent to the user and the fees are minimal. Even more
importantly, once converted there is no risk to either party
regarding the value. For example, $100 vUSD will always be
worth exactly $100 USD.

vX can be withdrawn
with an industry
standard Mastercard.

Since the VIVAconomy is a truly global economy, there is no
difference between moving funds between people located
across the room or across the globe. In both cases it just a
simple transaction between wallets. For those needing to send
funds to family members back home, this is a huge benefit.
Finally, the receiver must be able to easily and affordably
withdraw the funds.
To solve this final hurdle in the process, the VIVAconomy
provides two remarkable resources that no other
cryptocurrency has resolved so simply:
1.

A network of ATM machines

2.

Connected Mastercard debit cards

For over twelve months, the VIVA organization has been
successfully operating two cryptocurrency ATM machines in
the Tijuana region of Mexico. Using our own software stack
these ATM machines are capable of operating with any
currencies available on the TradeQwik Exchange.
They can also both accept and dispense Mexican Pesos.
Over the first twelve months after the VIVA Crown ICO, we will
be rolling out a network of 1000 VIVA ATMs around the world.

We already have 2 VIVA
ATM machines
functioning in Mexico.

The second way a receiver can withdraw funds is to connect the
vX balance in their local fiat currency of their VIVA wallet to a
Mastercard debit card.
We have already secured an agreement with a reliable
Mastercard provider that allows us to provide Mastercard debit
VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 31

cards that can be used anywhere Mastercard is accepted.
This means that the receiver can use his or her funds in millions of online and offline
merchants at no additional costs!
Clearly, the VIVA ATM and Remittance network will be hugely disruptive for companies in
the financial sector that have basically been scamming the most vulnerable populations
in our society for decades.

VIVA Blockchain Technology
The technological underpinnings of the VIVAconomy are, by
necessity, far more complex than those of a traditional
cryptocurrency.
Not only does the ecosystem include three interrelated
currencies, “VIVA Crowns” (VC), vX (vUSD, vEUR, etc) and “VIVA
Coins” (VIVA).
The economy's prime mover is TradeQwik - a fully functional
multi-currency online exchange. An entire software suite
engineered to provide seamless functioning of the VIVAconomy
via effortless on/off ramping, and exchanging between the
ecash world and the “real world”.

UltraLedger is a fork of
the Hyperledger Fabric
codebase.

To accomplish this the VIVA team has built our base from a
foundation utilizing some of the world's most innovative
blockchain technologies, then raising the bar by an entire order
of magnitude.
Core functionality of the VIVAconomy is derived from the open
source “Hyperledger Fabric”, we have innovated significantly
over their architecture to the point where it is effectively it's
own project.
UltraLedger, began with a fork of the Hyperledger Fabric
codebase, and incorporates the ability to perform seamless ndimensional, on-chain graphing. In fact, using the term
blockchain doesn't accurately reflect the VIVA architecture at
this point. It's more akin to an infinitely expandable graph
database with the same cryptographic guarantees provided by
more traditional blockchains, we just got rid of the drawbacks,
by rethinking problems such as Byzantine Fault Tolerance.

UltraLedger is a data
graph of immutable
timestamped records.

With UltraLedger, there isn't a single canonical blockchain.
Instead, there is a mutual agreement of summaries. Simply put,
VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

PAGE 33

the order of transactions isn't held in as high a regard as the fact
that all balances work out correctly in the end.
Unlike every other blockchain technology out there, so called
forking isn't considered a bad thing. In fact, forks under
UltraLedger are not only normal, but expected. Forks are just
the blockchain evolving in different places at different times.
UltraLedger is actually a data graph of immutable timestamped
records. This is important to keep in mind. It's an ndimensional graph, not a chain and not a directed acyclical
graph (DAG).
Our graph is capable of efficiently searching across an arbitrary
number of dimensions, because each data point is considered an
atom of information in and of itself located within an n
dimensional matrix. Attributes can be added and removed
arbitrarily according to business needs, thereby providing
arbitrary soft links between datapoints.

Our graph is capable
of efficiently searching
across an arbitrary
number of dimensions.

In this regard a complete blockchain can be thought of as a
large molecule like DNA or RNA whereas UltraLedger itself may
be thought of as a complex organism made up of many different
cells each with their own DNA.
To better understand this we first need to establish some
terminology:
1.

Channel: an isolated channel of communications. Each
channel has its own rules and and can form its own
blockchain.

2.

Stream: a stream of data generated by the mixing of
channels.

3.

Fault Tolerance: the ability for the network to compensate
when there is a lack of consensus. In the VIVAconomy the
penalty for polluting the primary VIVA consensus stream
with non-consensus data is severe enough to prevent it, but
it's always majority consensus and the only players in that
stream are the mints themselves.

Within the
VIVAconomy there is a
single channel per coin.

For all other streams, consensus is a by product of business
logic of the stream creator and it is up to the players in those
channels to determine for themselves if consensus is important
and even what constitutes consensus on a given stream.
The default block rate is 1 second per block and all messages are
valid if signed by someone who has submitted a public key to
the PKI stream. To compress this, only non-empty blocks are
ever stored in a channel.
Within the VIVAconomy there is a single channel "per coin", and
a complementary channel "per pair". Orders are placed in the "per

pair" channel, and gateways (such as the TradeQwik
Exchange) deal in the "per coin" channels.
Each of these channels is its own blockchain with its own
rules. Gateways make the interaction between channels
simple and seamless.
UltraLedger does not
require huge computing
resources to maintain
itself.

TradeQwik is the first gateway, and its exchange logic is
being ported to UltraLedger and will thus be utilizable by
anyone wishing to develop a new gateway into the
VIVAconomy.
One of the primary handicaps that other cryptocurrencies
like bitcoin have suffered under is the enormous computing
resources necessary to maintain themselves.
The multi-dimensional architecture of the VIVAconomy
together with the power of a true graph database, resolve
this fundamental problem. Worker nodes are able to
assume small atomic work transactions that don't require
knowledge of the entire universe of work.
This allows us to offload these atomic units of work into
partitioned workspaces of individual computers / miners.
Thus, everyone in the economy benefits without the need
to purchase, manage and administer huge server farms and
complex installations.

Direct access to our
developers is open to all
VIVA Crown Holders.

Our technological architecture is an engine that provides
the power for our primary goals in society - providing a
stable economy to all, a solid infrastructure for businesses
to build on and a lifetime “living income” to all Vivos (people
who utilize VIVA in their daily lives).
If you are interested in a more in depth look into the
technological underpinnings of the VIVAconomy, direct
access to our team of developers is open to all VIVA Crown
Holders.

VIVA Business Applications
In order for the VIVAconomy to become a viable mainstream
parallel economy, it is essential that it be closely coupled with the
traditional financial system.
To achieve this, our plan is to leverage the power of our blockchain
technology applying it to provide real world business solutions.
While many of these projects are still in their infancy, the plan is to
create multiple scalable points of entry into the VIVAconomy for
businesses of all types and sizes.
From simple payment processing to complex enterprise level
document processing systems, the power of the VIVA blockchain
technology will drive on-boarding into the VIVAconomy.
For example, by implementing a globally transparent system for
registering and tracking university course credits, we would be
providing a unique and powerful solution to institutions of higher
education around the world. We would also naturally be onboarding millions of students into the VIVAconomy at the same
time.

VIVA Business
Applications will drive
transactions and user
acquisition.

In a similar fashion, if we were to develop a system that facilitates
processing online payments for e-commerce providers at a lower
rate than is currently available, we would not only lower costs for
businesses but increase the number of people transacting directly
in VIVAcoins.
These types of applications are what we have named VIVA
Business Applications. We currently have a roadmap of seventeen
groundbreaking applications that would benefit from the use of
our technology while simultaneously growth hacking our path
towards mainstream acceptance.
One of these applications, MedicAxess, is already in its testing
phase and is scheduled to go live in the fourth quarter of 2017.
VIVA White Paper - April 3, 2017

Real World Case Study - MedicAxess
At this time there are already several businesses who have signed up to
utilize the VIVA network.
A real world example of this is MedicAxess, a HIPAA compliant Electronic
Health Records (EHR) and remote tele-medicine system.
MedicAxess sells EHR software and services to medical providers such as
Doctors and Hospitals. EHR is a hugely lucrative business, and this
software would be out of reach for most small providers. MedicAxess sells
their services on a consumption based model that has fees far lower than
would otherwise be possible.
Nevertheless, providers MUST pay for access, and when they do, they
must pay in either VIVAcoin or fiat.
As a value added service, MedicAxess has set up a gateway that
allows the providers to accept payment from patients in either
VIVAcoin or fiat. Patients can earn VIVAcoin simply by running a
small piece of software that connects their home computer to the
“MedicAxess network”, a task specific subset of the VIVA network
(every mint operates on their own specific network subset).

MedicAxess is the first
VIVA Business
Application.

Once they are connected, users can provide services to their hospital or
doctor. In this way, patients can offset their real world medical bills by
using their spare computing resources to earn VIVAcoin.
This is just a single business application for the VIVAconomy, it’s real and
it’s being built right now and it will be a billion dollar organization.
MedicAxess is an existing Crown Holder and their mint is slated to come
online in the fourth quarter of 2017.

How we will use the funds
VIVA is a lifetime project for all of us. We genuinely believe that
we can have a significant positive impact on millions of lives
around the globe. This is how we commit ourselves to using the
funds we raise.

Core VIVAconomy Development
Obviously the first order of business is to bring to bear the
necessary resources for building out the remaining infrastructure
that is needed to make the VIVAconomy fully functional.

Outreach and Mainstreaming
In parallel as we release new functionalities, we will be launching
ongoing outreach campaigns to help drive the on-boarding of
Vivos and businesses that will accept VIVAcoin.

VIVA Business Application Development Grants
With over half a century of real-world experience under our belts,
we fully understand the danger of becoming overextended.
For this reason, we have decided to implement a series of VIVA
Business Application Grants that will help finance talented groups
of blockchain developers all over the world to develop
commercially viable business applications that extend the reach
of the VIVAconomy.
These independent teams of engineers will not only gain direct
access to the experience and wisdom of the core VIVA architects,
but we will also collaborate in their promotion and rollout as the
applications go live.
These grants are one way that we wish to show gratitude to the
amazing cryptocurrency community that we are so proud to be a
part of.

The VIVA Team
A project as serious and ambitious as VIVA requires a solid team in
order to succeed. While primarily a technological endeavor, we
understand that we can only achieve our goal of providing longterm
recurring income to millions of Vivos through a concerted effort on
all fronts.
For this reason, we have assembled a world class team of four
founders supported by an extensive community of VIVA enthusiasts.
After the ICO we will be expanding the team to assure the longterm
viability of the VIVAconomy.
Below is a summary of our core leadership team:
Dawn Parker Waites is our CEO and mama bear of the team. She has
a long background in business including the property management,
mortgage, and sustainability industries. She has been involved in
political and technology think tanks since the late 90s and has
taught at San Diego State University in the Green Energy
Management program. She published a respected online news
portal, San Diego Loves Green, that was bought by a public company
in 2012. Dawn has been a thought leader and political activist in
Southern California, and was an organizer in the Occupy Wall Street
movement in California.
Alec Hahn is our COO and oversees our Mexican and European
operations. Alec is the spirit of the team and since early 2010, has
been involved with Bitcoin. He has worked with several Blockchain
technologies including Bitcoin42 and BitHalo. His work as a media
designer has been commissioned and displayed at the Museum of
London, Deutsches Museum in Munich and Cineteca Nacional in
Mexico City. Alec has written, directed, produced, photographed and
edited various short films that took him to film festivals around the
world. As a freelancer he worked for the Rachel Carson Center in
Munich. Alec also is a co-founder of Earthivism, a non-profit

organization that produces Imperfectu: International Film and
Gender Studies Festival in Tijuana with his wife Josephina.
Dennis H. Lewis is our CMO and is a serial entrepreneur and
self-proclaimed digital storyteller. An author of three books, he
has an uncanny knack of being able to distill complex
technologies and explain them in ways that are fun and
approachable. Over his extensive career he has lead startups
both in Europe and the United States and currently runs a
successful digital marketing firm in Orlando, FL. He has been
featured on mainstream media outlets like The New York Times,
Good Morning America and the BBC.
William Banks is our CTO and mastermind / architect. Mr Banks
has an MBA with an emphasis on IT Management as well as a
Bachelor's in Computer Science. He's been heavily involved in
infotech in general and fin-tech in particular for the past two
decades. William began his professional career with the US Navy
where he worked with cryptography and security extensively.
Since his time in the Navy, William has worked as an IT
consultant and systems architect for several of the top Fortune
500 companies. Eventually leaving corporate America to take
the lead on several open source projects including this one.
We believe that the injustices and inequalities in our society are
largely the fruit of a powerful cartel of greedy financiers
determined to protect the archaic structures of a financial
system implemented largely in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries. The time has come for a new paradigm. The time has
come for VIVA.

VIVA ICO Terms & Conditions
The token to be sold as part of the ICO will be 6,500 VIVA
Crowns.
VIVA Crowns are the drivers of the VIVAconomy. Unlike
other tokens and coins, VIVA Crowns are incredibly scarce
and hold great power that cannot be usurped. There will
only be a maximum of 42,000 VIVA Crowns in circulation
after the ICO, and this target will take hundreds of years to
reach since only one Crown is created each week.
Each VIVA Crown holds a Treasury Right to mint a set
supply of VIVAcoins each week that is determined by the
consensus of all Crown Holders. So, by purchasing a VIVA
Crown, you are purchasing the ability to create a Treasury
Right, basically a license to print an allocated amount of
VIVAcoins each week. This Treasury Right can be assigned,
rented or sold to a mint of your choice.

Each VIVA Crown will
be available for purchase
at 188.679 VIVAcoins.

Every mint is required to be connected to a business
activity, which will leverage the VIVA network by using and
paying for it’s competitively priced infrastructure. The
Treasury Right can also be leased out to businesses for an
interest payment if the Crown Holder chooses not to run
their own business.
The ICO will commence at 12.00 EST on May 1st and run
until May 20th, or when all of the available tokens have
been sold, whichever comes first.
Each VIVA Crown coin will be available for purchase
through the TradeQwik Exchange.

1.0 Abstract
Wagerr is a decentralized sportsbook that brings trustless sportsbetting to the entire world.
Due to its strict use of Application Specific Smart Contracts (ASSC) and 2nd layer network
controlled by Oracle Masternodes, Wagerr solves the security, scaling and incentive issues
that have plagued smart contracts since their inception. Additionally, Wagerr combines
leaps in technical design with an economic linkage that creates a deflationary, and self
regulating economy. Through decentralized governance and contract fees, structural
mechanisms balance Wagerr’s token value by dynamically adjusting supply based on the
current exchange rate and betting volume within the Wagerr network.
Wagerr does this all while avoiding single points of failure and implementing a network and
system that is fully decentralized.

2.0 Manifesto
Bit by bit: a manifesto for modern freedom through decentralization
Wagerr celebrates the freedoms and new possibilities opened by the internet and
especially those opened by bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology.
The internet delivered a decentralized network, that was everywhere yet nowhere. The
internet was and is a radical and disruptive experiment that propagated new ways of living,
new forms of relationships, and new discoveries of the nature of social practices we have
taken for granted. We have made new discoveries about inherent unconditional rights and
freedoms previously unimaginable. The context has shifted. New pleasures are possible.
And the freedom to pursue happiness takes on new meanings, new implications, for
individual and collective behavior, indeed even for ​network behavior​.
The creation of secure, self-regulating networks that behave in mechanically predictable
ways, offload the perceived need to control human behavior. Fairness is built in.
However, these new freedoms face daily peril as the Internet gets re-centralized in the form
of applications, websites, corporate conglomerates, and creeping regulatory action. The
proper burden of freedom is constant vigilance.
It is not that Google, Apple, and Microsoft are inherently bad. Concern arises when people’s
identities become products for a corporate resale. These same people are led to mistake
the web for the internet, as if the current state of the web corresponds with the aspirations
of the decentralized internet. Concern grows deeper when profiteers mistake utility for

1

power, and people regard their own consumer behavior as mere consumerism when,
simultaneously, their identities are being harvested and auctioned to the highest bidder.
A corporate model that commercializes and exploits the things that are most personal and
most private about individual lives and identities only to repackage those identities for
targeted advertising, or worse, extortion or blackmailing — all while perpetuating
predatory targeting and exploitation of non transparent policies. This has become the
modern antithesis of freedom.
Wagerr believes that sports betting persists throughout societies despite efforts to curtail it
because it is ​fundamentally fun​ and it is intrinsic to human nature to exercise free choice.
Wagerr believes that self-regulating, open source systems can produce better, more
reliable and fair outcomes because they are not subject to human vagaries. People can
design and control machines, systems and networks more precisely and more reasonably
than they could ever control other people — even themselves.
To the extent that government limits people's capacity to exercise free choice and blocks
the pursuit of happiness by means of regulation of a simple entertainment industry, it
curtails our capacity to be truly human, truly free.
Wagerr believes the internet is the greatest invention of modern time. Access to this
freedom must always be free of fear and legal repercussions. Instead of having to invest
trust into unknown individuals or entities who may or may not be there tomorrow, players
can rely on a trustless and decentralized system.
Services should be decentralized.
Systems should protect users.
Access should be free and open.
No more platforms. No more websites. No more apps.
No more paternalism. No more systemic corruption.
No more arbitrary restrictions and self-serving barriers.

Bit by bit, we shall decentralize.

3.0 Problem Overview
What is the problem with sports betting?
●

Excessive risks for sports bettors
○ Exploitation of identity/information
○ Regulatory repercussions
○ Total irrecoverable loss of funds
○ Vulnerability to manipulation

●

Unpredictable risks for corporate and private bookkeepers
○
○
○
○

Regulatory repercussions
Government confiscation of funds
Frozen assets
Security vulnerabilities

Sports betting has a bad rap. Simple analysis traces the industry’s clouded reputation to
the regulatory practices that drive sports betting underground, and the inevitable problems
that result from systems of trust enforced only by greed and fear of violence. The
reputation of bookkeeping (and gambling in general) and problematic efforts at regulation
are mutually reinforcing. When government impose regulations they inadvertently drive
betting underground. When underground markets become violent or result in tragic
economic losses, the justification for regulatory control of a purportedly dangerous
industry becomes self-fulfilling.
Some governments, knowing that betting activity will continue — even if it is declared a
crime — allow licensed betting. Governments charge fees for licensure and regulation and
tax the industry and any winnings. A so-called "sin tax" justifies excessive government
confiscation and control premised on the notion that extragovernmental sports betting is
inherently dangerous and constitutes a moral vice.
The first irony is that this political competition for control over gambling income — the
question of "who will be the house" — inevitably corrupts the politicians and government
officials who benefit from the "vice" that they purport to regulate. The industry becomes
“pay to play” for entities to participate and compete, leading to oligarchy.

3

A second irony is that regulation is inevitably ineffective, resulting in legal loopholes that
are used to bring products and services to market anyway, often at a high cost to efficiency.
This waste of resources would better serve economies, and ultimately, communities, in
other areas of production.
The third irony is that the regulation itself produces a combination of corrupt and
dangerous markets: the legally regulated one and the underground one regulated by
vigilante practices.
The result is moral hypocrisy on the part of regulators, an arbitrary and unpredictable
mishmash of inefficient local regulatory practices and the flourishing of underground
markets which are, indeed, more risky both because sports bettors and bookkeepers risk
criminal prosecution and because they have no recourse to the law when one party fails to
deliver what they owe.
Government regulation is a protection racket
In short, government regulation of sports betting is a racket. Government regulators make
money by providing "protection" to citizens, sports bettors, and legitimate bookkeepers.
But the protection offered is only necessary because the underground markets are defined
by the government itself​ as illegal, the participants defined as criminals, and their everyday
practices require participants to rely upon a delicate balance of "trust," on one hand, and
the threat, and potential reality, of severe violence on the other. Even when government
regulation of sports betting is a well intended effort at protection; it is a racket,
nonetheless. Worse yet, governments are not only confiscating winnings to pay for
“protecting” citizens from dangers and corruption — the government officials, themselves,
are corrupted by their incentives to collect taxes and maintain power, thus facilitating the
dangers that perpetuate the narrative and their role as protection.
Centralization as the core problem
●
●
●

Trust requirements
Centralization of power, control
Non-distributed systems

Wagerr agrees: the current state of sports betting is terribly risky, expensive, corrupt, and
dangerous. But it doesn't have to be this way. Wagerr has identified the elements crucial to
a safer, more secure way to practice sports betting. Wagerr, furthermore, has designed a
system that brings this better way to the whole world without borders. This is a big deal.
Illegal sports betting in the US and China combined totals a trillion Dollars in illegal bets.
Despite efforts at heavy regulation, people are betting anyhow. And they are doing so in an
insecure and unsafe manner. Wagerr provides a global solution to a vast array of localized
problems in sports betting markets.

4

4.0 Criteria for a solution
Distributed, decentralized, trustless, stable, private
Any solution to the problems of the ​status quo​ for the sports betting industry must serve
the interests of sports bettors and also satisfy the needs of the contributors who maintain
the security and functionality of the network. To this end, we believe that any solution
must:
●
●
●
●
●

Be fairly and widely distributed to speed up adoption and reduce market risk.
Be fully decentralized to remove single points of failure and individual control.
Function in a trustless manner, so one party’s dishonesty does not jeopardize the
fairness of the entire system’s performance.
Include mechanisms that stabilize the value of the network’s underlying token of
exchange, whether adoption dramatically rises or falls.
Guarantee user privacy.

Wagerr satisfies all the above requirements:
●
●
●
●
●

Its ICO and the related marketing efforts draw interested investors and bettors.
A fully open source codebase attracts diverse technical interest and allows for
anyone to have say in its development and future.
Rigidly programmed contract rules and subroutines enforce trustless operation of
the network.
The destruction of 48% of total contract fees ties betting activity to Wagerr’s market
value and reduces volatility.
And finally, no personal information is required or stored to usage Wagerr. The
network is available from any internet connection and is not subject to regulatory
oversight. Wagerr’s open network does not reinforce centralized identities, freeing
participants from any stigma associated with sports betting.

5.0 Features and functions of Wagerr
Transaction functions
Wagerr is a two tiered network comprised of standard wallets and Oracle Masternodes.
Standard Proof of Stake wallets
● The first layer is the standard transactional layer in which basic wallets earn rewards
for block formation.
● Provide network security and confirm blocks of transactions that constitute the
blockchain, the ledger of immutable transactions.
● Maintain a full copy of the blockchain.
Oracle Masternode intranet
● Oracle Masternodes, a second layer of the Wagerr network, function as consensus
agents, forging betting contracts, retrieving sporting events outcomes data, and
consensually validating results that trigger contractual payouts.
● Oracle Masternodes also mediate decentralized governance of the Wagerr network,
as discussed in greater detail in section 7.10
Betting functions
The Wagerr system facilitates three modalities of sports betting:
1. Peer to peer betting
Peer to peer betting (or “head to head” betting) requires two partners to take
opposite sides of a betting contract. The players agree on the betting line and the
total amount at stake. One player initiates the bet by posting it to the blockchain
from their wallet. When the partner sends coins for the complementary side of the
bet, the blockchain tags them as transactions with dispositions contingent upon the
outcome of the specified event. Once the event is completed, the Oracle
Masternode network records the performance result on the blockchain, triggering a
payout to the winner. If the event never happens, the coins, minus fees, are
returned to the original transactors.
This feature is great for casual players, friends who live apart, colleagues, etc. They
can make a plan, forge a contract on the blockchain, and leave the rest to the
Wagerr network.
2. Multi user betting
Multi User betting is like peer to peer betting, but in this case multiple users can
take the complementary position against a larger bet until the total value of the bet
is met. Since this mode of betting requires less specificity about the size of the bet,
the blockchain can perform the work of matching multiple bets until an equally
weighted or minimum contract is achieved.

6

3. Peerless direct chain betting
Peerless betting does not require a complementary transaction to forge a contract.
Any bettor can initiate a contract on chain, which the Wagerr network is
programmed to pay out if the bettor wins. Peerless betting maximizes flexibility for
bettors.
How does Wagerr balance the risks of peerless betting?
The blockchain pays out winning bets that are confirmed by the Oracle Masternode
network, by minting coins for the payout. This means that the blockchain does
accrue some risk of coin supply expansion though forging such contracts, but the
risk is balanced by several factors.
Losing bets systematically destroy coins, creating a balance over time. That’s
because 48% of all betting fees are destroyed, tipping that balance in favor of net
coin destruction from direct chain betting.
In fact, because losing bets destroy more coins than winning bets generate coins on
the network, an intrinsic advantage is created for all WGR holders in terms of coin
supply. Specifically, on a losing bet of 100 WGR, 96.88 WGR would be destroyed; by
contrast, on a winning bet of 100 WGR, only 94 WGR would be generated. This
imbalance constitutes the house edge of approximately 3%.
The final technological balance is a development called, “dynamic odds balancing.”
When peerless betting creates an imbalance in risk, where the payout liability is
higher for winning than for losing, the network dynamically adjusts odds to
encourage complementary betting that will balance the network liability.
Peerless betting is by far the simplest solution for sports bettors because it requires
no planning, and eliminates the risk of finding complementary partners.
Peerless betting also attracts traditional sports betting operations that routinely
manage their own payout liability by placing bets with peer organizations. Now,
instead of relying on their peers to take the other side, major sports betting outfits
can enjoy low fee betting on the trustless Wagerr system instead of entrusting
assets to competitors.
That’s important because regulated competitors are subject to regulatory insecurity
and unregulated competitors have no legal obligation to honor agreements. Wagerr,
a decentralized technological system, does not require sports bettors or sports
betting organizations to trust any one party whose trustworthiness cannot be
verified. Users instead entrust verifiable open source code that they can inspect for
themselves.

6.0 Economics: Structural dynamics of Wagerr’s economic system
Sports betting market context:
The estimated scale of the traditional sports betting market (including both legal and illegal
bets, internationally) is in the trillions of USD. An estimated $400 billion dollars illegal bets
are placed annually in the United States alone. China’s illegal betting market is even more
extensive. Traditional sports betting in many locales is driven underground, leading to
corruption, unfairness, and violence. Wagerr offers this untapped market the opportunity
to choose a safe, private, and accessible way to bet through decentralized blockchain
technology.
Because Wagerr is (better) decentralized, private, and lower-fee with a compelling value
proposition, Wagerr has the potential to win substantial market share in the long run.
However, even if Wagerr only captures a fraction of the trillion dollar market, the world will
be a little safer and the mechanisms built into the Wagerr model will have a powerful and
overwhelmingly positive effect on the Wagerr economy, and long term token value.
“Value coupling,” in particular, creates an extraordinary value proposition for sports
bettors, the sports betting industry, and for investors at every scale.

6.1 Value coupling: Price tied to usage
●

Value coupling: price tied to usage
○ Basic: supply and demand; burning vs minting
○ Advanced: Price dynamically affects burn rate
■ High priced WGR = declining burn rate (market stabilization)
● Stable price helps bettors predict potential winnings
● Higher prices are always a win
■ Low priced WGR = accelerating burn rate (mitigates inflation)
● Self-balancing system
● Price declines are temporary

“Value coupling” defined:
The value of the Wagerr token (WGR) is systematically tied to the use of the sports
betting blockchain.
The Wagerr network reduces the risk to value and protects holders of WGR tokens by
linking betting volume to coin supply. This “value coupling” between usage and supply is a

8

built-in deflationary mechanism that destroys 48% of the fee from every bet. With fees of
2%-6%, the net result is nearly 1-3% of every bet permanently removed from the network.
For example, if price falls dramatically, significantly more outstanding supply is destroyed
with every bet, because bets now require more WGR. Conversely, if price rises dramatically,
significantly less supply is destroyed. Over time, this leads to less market volatility and an
asset value that more accurately reflects both adoption and usage.
Wagerr’s systematic destruction of fees thus creates supply scarcity over time. As the
average volume of betting activity over the Wagerr network rises, the value of Wagerr rises
with it, enabling all investors to participate in its strong growth potential simply by holding
WGR tokens.

At any point in time the price of Wagerr combined with the volume of bets defines how
much deflation takes place on the Wagerr blockchain. See for yourself how these three
variables interact with the ​Interactive Value Calculator​ on wagerr.com.
Wagerr is designed to be more than a blockchain, it is designed to be a responsive and
price linked economy. For users to feel safe holding the token and to bet with it, they need
to have confidence in the value backing the coin. In Wagerr’s case the method of ensuring
that the value grows over time is by creating a deflationary economy.
Why not make Wagerr an asset backed coin?
Asset backed coins are powerful and have proven to be valuable in the crypto space.
Wagerr, however, was designed to be fully decentralized. Since ownership and control by a
central authority are required to back the value of an asset, the requirements are
incompatible with the function of the Wagerr network.

6.2 Value proposition for sports bettors
●

Lower fees
○ Wagerr incentivizes bettors to use the network and to acquire, use, and hold
WGR
○ Use: lower fees inherently better
○ Better margins for players: higher probabilities through lower fees
○ Potential to win bigger value
○ Potential to win just by holding

Wagerr is custom built for sports bettors and the sports betting industry. For a low fee,
players can place their bets in secure escrow. Winners get automatic payouts after the
event outcome is confirmed on the blockchain through consensual validation.
The Wagerr network confirms real world gaming results accurately because of strict
enforcement of the requirements for Oracle Masternodes participation. The penalties for
Oracles that attempt to feed bad data to the network are prohibitive. Supermajority (75%)
consensus among the Oracle Masternode network is required in order to post game results
on the blockchain, making result security extraordinarily robust.
There's no risk of overleveraged betting in the Wagerr system because no one can bet
more WGR than they have. Loan sharks and associated violence are excluded from the
Wagerr network.
Higher probability play through lower fees
Since Wagerr’s fees are lower than traditional sportsbooks, the probabilities of success over
time improve because the bettor doesn’t need to win as often to make their sports betting
practice profitable long term.
Buy low, use high
Sports bettors who buy Wagerr when its price is low may choose to use it for betting when
the value is high to get even more value per token. By buying low and spending high,
bettors leverage Wagerr’s advantageous ecodynamics to amplify their betting power
because they can place larger bets with smaller amounts of initial capital.
Bet high, win higher
Since returns on betting is a matter of probabilities, buying low and spending high
increases the likelihood of profit, by first reducing the initial investment and, second,
increasing the value of the payout.
Win higher, bet higher still

10

Actually, if the price continues to rise, successful bettors can repeat the process: waiting
until the winnings increase in value again before placing a new bet would mean that the
initial capital at stake remains nominal while the reward potential continues to grow.
6.3 Value proposition for holders of WGR
You don’t have to be a bettor or an investor or even a trader for a high probability chance
to win simply by obtaining and holding Wagerr. Wagerr is optimized for growth. The
mechanisms for controlled scarcity of the coin supply mean that as Wagerr adoption rises,
systematic destruction of fees puts upward pressure on the price of the coin. Those who
hold WGR and operate a standard staking wallet will accrue newly minted WGR as the
wallets contribute to network security. The probabilities of winning stake rewards increase
with the amount of WGR held in the wallet.

6.4 Value proposition for the sports betting industry
Arbitrage through peerless direct on chain betting
Traditional sportsbooks frequently find that they have taken on too much payout liability
when their customers’ bets are unbalanced, strongly favoring one side. If the overweighted
team wins, the sportsbook has to carry that cost against their bottom line. They typically
manage their liability by placing bets, themselves, with competing sportsbooks. Wagerr
offers lower fees, automated payouts, and strong security against manipulation. Even
though Wagerr will function as a competitor to traditional sportsbooks, the blockchain also
offers a potent solution at a competitive price.
For additional information on mechanisms that safeguard the network for arbitrage
functions, please see discussion of “dynamic odds balancing,” under, “​Peerless direct chain
betting​.”
6.5 Value to investors
●
●

Market share + value coupling = [burn rate > mint rate] = deflationary economy
Rewards for contributions that increase and maintain Wagerr network value
○ Oracle Masternodes
■ Forge smart contract with multiphase transactions
● Phase 1: Initiate conditional contract
● Phase 2: Validated conditions trigger payouts
■ Retrieve and validate data
■ Collect, distribute, escrow, and burn fees
■ Be the house

11

Because of value coupling, betting volume drives WGR token value. The enormity of the
existing sports betting industry suggests that when the disruptive technology of Wagerr
wins even a fraction of the sports betting market share, the betting volume would be
enough to drive a deflationary economy, one in which the rate of coin destruction exceeds
the rate of coin generation.
Investors have three key options for investing in WGR. Buying and holding WGR, staking
WGR in standard staking wallets, or acquiring enough WGR to operate an Oracle
Masternode. The last option, Oracle Masternodes, offer the most to investors because they
win ongoing staking awards, and they also earn fees for forging betting contracts and
updating real life event outcomes on the blockchain. While all who hold WGR can benefit
from the house advantage described under Peerless direct chain betting (Section 5.3), the
Oracle Masternodes’ function is analogous to the house: 50% of fees players pay for betting
services go directly to Oracle Masternodes
Smart incentives
Oracle Masternode rewards are strategically designed to promote behaviors that add value
to the Wagerr network. To recap the rewards: Oracle Masternode operators win in three
ways:
●
●
●

Earn a percentage of block rewards (direct, static reward)
Earn sports betting fees (direct usage-based reward)
WGR value improved by network ecodynamics (indirect, usage-based rewards)

The system of rewards incentivizes Oracles’ crucial role as consensus agents, retrieving and
consensually validating sporting event outcomes, a crucial role in the sports betting
blockchain. Static block rewards incentivize node operators to hold WGR and operate
wallets with 24/7 connectivity. Failure to consistently retrieve and post data that aligns with
consensus results in deactivation.
Because the rewards for operating Oracle Masternodes is predictably far greater in the
long run than liquidating them, investors will be loath to give up the residual income they
generate. Masternode and staking rewards keeps coins in active use in the network, and
keeps their holders from adding sell pressure to the market.
Oracle Masternodes are also vehicles of blockchain governance. Since no one has more
invested in the wellbeing of the Wagerr network that drive the value of the WGR token,
Oracle operators exercise governance through the distributed network of Oracle
Masternodes.

6.6 Value to the field of digital currency
Standing on the shoulders of giants
Wagerr integrates core technology developed by brilliant teams. The Wagerr team stands
on the shoulders of giants. That’s partly possible because open source technology
facilitates asynchronous collaborations that can advance technological capacities. Even
before the idea of Wagerr, the core technology that Wagerr has been using to build its
sports betting network already existed. The existence of the core technology should
reassure potential investors of the feasibility of fully achieving the Wagerr network vision.
So, what does Wagerr bring to the table that’s relevant to the field of digital currencies?
While the components, like “smart contracts,” are familiar to those who stay current with
blockchain technology, it is what Wagerr does with the components that contributes to the
field.
Crafting a coin to cultivate an economy
The Wagerr team didn’t set out to make a “currency.” Instead, the Wagerr team has
engineered an economy​. The key to the model’s design has been the structuring of
incentives to reward and maintain behaviors that add value to the Wagerr network, and
devising subsystems that translate the Wagerr network value to the WGR token value.
ICO structure incentivizes maximal distribution
From the beginning, the ICO structure gamifies participation by rewarding early investors
with the prospect of progressive bonuses contingent upon the ICO’s incremental success.
Early investors thus are not only invested in the wellbeing of the coin, but also in the
optimal success of the ICO. As the ICO approaches sale of the maximum number of coins,
the Wagerr network becomes increasingly distributed, meaning that more and more
people are invested in Wagerr. The very structure of the ICO promotes a basic goal of
decentralization which makes the network more robust. Secondarily, this gamification of
the ICO makes it more fun, aligning with Wagerr’s commitment to the freedom to pursue
happiness.
Value coupling creates incentives for participants to contribute network value
Value coupling mechanisms incentivize all who hold Wagerr to contribute to the value of
the Wagerr network, with greater rewards incentivizing greater investments in Oracle
Masternodes which perform the security operations, consensus agent functions, and
contract management roles at the heart of the sports betting blockchain.
Price stabilization enables currencies to function as a store of value
Since the key value coupling mechanism involves destroying a percentage of all betting
fees, increased betting volume augments the network value by means of a self-regulating
coin supply. Because this mechanisms adjusts dynamically with the price of the WGR token,
the system favors balanced growth, mitigating price fluctuations in either direction. While
bitcoin, the first mover, remains king among digital currencies, its unmoored value

13

prevents long term commercial adoption as a store of value beyond its momentary use in
value transactions. In other words, a coin that ranges in value from $200-$3000 in a year is
too volatile to serve all of the functions of a currency.
Bitcoin still clearly plays a vital role in international economics as a pressure valve in times
of crisis. Bitcoin’s volatility also makes for exciting opportunities for speculative trading.
Wagerr, however, hopes to see other developers designing digital currency economies that
solve real world problems and fit into the lives of people whose current everyday
economies depend primarily upon centralized currencies.

7.0 Betting Engine & Technical Architecture
The innovation and technical leaps that Wagerr makes is contained in its simple but
powerful Smart Contracts and powerful 2nd layered consensus agents known as Oracle
Masternodes
The Wagerr network has two layers. The first layer is the standard Proof of Stake (POS)
blockchain that allows users to send coins from one standard address to another. The
second layer of the network is comprised of Oracle masternodes. This layer allows players
to place bets on events that the Oracle masternodes confirm and post as real world
matches.
There are three types of betting transactions on the Wagerr network.
● Head to Head
● Multi User
● Peerless Direct on Chain

7.1 Head to Head Betting Process
The blockchain mediates bets between two players taking opposite sides on upcoming
sporting events. The fee for an executed contract is 2% of the payout. 1% goes to the
processing Oracle and 1% gets burned. Here is the flow of a head to head bet from start to
finish.

14

Wagerr System Allows
1. Step 1​ Oracles actively searching for new events inside supported leagues, always
trying to build consensus for upcoming events. Consensus for a new event requires
a supermajority; Of the 2000 possible Oracle Masternodes, 1500 need to report the
same event defined by the Event’s UTC Time, and their unique identifying codes.
2. Step 2​ User are able to view the posted events and place bets against existing
posted bets or set a new line and matched amount (for a taker or bet partner to fill).
Once betting pairs are determined to be complementary, a smart contract can be
created and initiated on the Wagerr blockchain
3. Step 3 ​Now that a smart contract is initiated, the development and burn portion of
the fees within that bet contract are distributed and burned. (48% destroyed, 2% to
Wagerr development fund) The Oracle Masternodes create transactions dependent
on the two opposing bets predicted outcome.

15

4. Step 4​ After the event concludes, the Oracle network relies again on supermajority
consensus to determine the outcome of the event. This posting allows the contract
to be signaled for resolution.
5. Step 5​ Once the bet has been signalled for resolution the winning bets are
processed and paid out accordingly. All non-resolved events in the issue of a tie or
event never occurring the contract is resolved via the Oracle masternode network
and both sides receive their bet back minus the fee. Once the smart contract is
resolved the oracle who processes the bet receives their portion of the fee.
7.2 Multi User betting
To make it easier to find and fulfill more bets on low volume events, the system allows
multiple players to be paired against a single bettor. This ensures that large bets do not
require an exact match to forge a contract. The fee for this transaction is 4 percent. 2% of
the fee goes to the Oracle processing the transaction and 2% gets burned. ​Here is the Flow
of a multiple user bet from start to finish.

16

7.3 Peerless Direct Chain betting
In the final phase of major development of the token, Wagerr gives the player the option to
forgo looking for a match and bet directly against the chain, using the chain itself to take
their bet automatically. The fee for this transaction is 6 percent. 3% of the fee goes to the
Oracle that processes the request and 3% is automatically burned. ​Here is the Flow of a
multiple user bet from start to finish.

17

7.4 Creating and Resolving events
Once the event is completed, the Oracle Masternode network can begin to post the
outcome data. An event outcome is confirmed only after 75% of all Oracle Masternodes
achieve consensus on the outcome. Once the outcome is finalized and posted, the Wagerr
network recognizes completion of the contract, and the winning user is paid out
accordingly.

Creating events is dependent on The Oracle Masternodes posting data that can be
consensually verified. Wagerr achieves this through creating a unique means of structuring
events and bets. Below you can see exactly how the bets will be posted and how unique
events are distinguished as single events.

18

7.5 Time Related Conditions (Atomic Pairing)
Betting closes 10 blocks before the event is scheduled to begin.
Most contractual conditions surrounding bets are related to real-world time. Block times
are dynamic, not static, while events are coded in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Block
time closing in on bets being accepted is no later than 10 blocks before the event happens.
(10 Blocks = 10:40:00) (target/approx)
When a user posts a bet on the cusp of approximately the 10 minute mark, one of two
events will occur on the blockchain, resulting either in contract formation (match and
confirm), or transaction failure (in which case, the transaction would not be accepted, and
the pre-bid coin locations remain unaltered).
In order for the transaction to confirm, two conditions must be met: first, there must be a
match between the amount of the initiating bet and the amounts of the complementary
bets taking the other side. Second, the official time that the block containing this
transaction is first confirmed on the chain (encoded in UTC time) must be prior to the
T-minus-10 minute mark for the sporting event.
In technical terms, “atomic pairing” is the synchronization of two conditions (the two sides
of the betting contract) occurring at the same time.
and the bet is taken, the bet is an atomic transaction (meaning that the transactions
happen at the same time or in the same block) This ensures that the bets that are taken
they get accepted and processed in time. It also ensures that users do not have to pay fees
on bets that are never matched.
The timeframe for a payout to take place will be a target time of 1 hour after the event
outcome is resolved. Oracle Masternodes post data for all supported leagues every hour as
long as Oracles are in agreement of the outcome the payout should take place no longer
than 90 minutes after the event ends.
In the event of a tie, push, or the event not taking place, the Oracle Masternode network
will resolve the and confirm and initiate the return of the wagered amount back to the
bettors original wallet addresses minus the betting fee. This process can take up to 24
hours to ensure the Oracle Masternode network has time to achieve consensus.
7.6 Activating an Oracle Masternode
Activating an Oracle Masternode is the process by which an individual chooses to promote
their node, engage in a 30 day contract of service and become a consensus agent. This
contract ensures that owners have to maintain a level of service and agree to lock the
collateralized coins in a simple smart contract that initiates a timed release.

19

Oracle Masternode requirements:
●
●
●
●
●

25000 WGR collateralized over a 30 day service contract
Uptime 99%+ (measured weekly)
Retrieve and input sporting event outcomes data
Public IP with a forced network port number
Bandwidth to accommodate the total volume of API calls

7.7 Promotion queue
In order to balance opportunities to operate Oracle Masternodes against the efficiencies of
the two-tier network and the need to have WGR tokens available for betting, the network
will cap the total number of Oracle Masternodes operating on the network.
Once the network has reached its maximum designated Oracle count, all wallets that apply
for promotion to Oracle Masternode status enter a queue awaiting an opening (either
voluntary withdrawal or involuntary demotion of an acting node). Promotion is on a first
come, first served basis, i.e., the nodes that have spent the longest time in the queue get
promoted first.
Oracles that are promoted must submit and synchronize match data every hour. This
allows for quick payouts of resolved events. When events cannot be resolved due to the
match not being played or other extenuating circumstances, the bets are refunded after 48
hours without a resolution.
7.8 Demotion
Non-Participating or underperforming Oracle Masternodes can be demoted from (or
promoted to) the network depending on a combination of several factors:
●
●
●
●

Network connectivity uptime
Less than 50% participation on submission in all leagues
Results submission accuracy
Non-renewal of 30 day collateral contract

7.9 Governance
Once the distributed network is established and stable, the original Wagerr development
team will fully relinquish control of the github and distribute the role of governance to the
network. The Wagerr network achieves decentralized governance through a voting system
in which each Oracle Masternode holds the franchise. This second tier of the network

20

extends the principles of proof of stake to the most heavily invested Oracle Masternodes
which perform the essential functions of the sports betting blockchain.
Funds have been allocated for continuous investment of ongoing development to
contribute growing value to the network and to fund adaptations to any unanticipated
phenomena not accounted for in the original design. The Oracle intranet collectively has
the power to vote on network rules, development targets, and the allocation of dedicated
development funds.
7.9.1 Payout dispute
In the event that a user or node believes they did not receive a proper payout, there are
measures users can take to signal and petition the Oracle Masternode network to request
a review of the resolution to their bet. Signaling for a review is as simple as submitting a
contract. Supermajority consensus (75%) of the Oracle Masternodes must be obtained to
overturn or invalidate betting contracts.
7.9.2 Penalized nodes
If a node continues to submit match data that falls out of consensus after they have been
demoted in the past, the Oracle network can vote to penalize the node of any of the fees
collected since its promotion. The network recovers these coins via the collateralized coins
via 90% supermajority vote in the terms of the smart contract.
7.9.3 Oracle Masternode voting
A decentralized voting mechanism within the Wagerr wallet allows network and protocol
changes to be proposed. From there, the Oracle Masternodes as a whole vote on the
proposal. Each change or modification passed with two thirds majority is deployed to the
main network automatically.
Example: An Oracle operator would vote on a protocol or core change simply by using the
command “masternode vote yay” or “masternode vote nay,” votes would then propagate
across the network, be tallied, and the instructions would be followed by the network itself.
Operators have the option to abstain by simply not voting. Abstaining Oracle Masternodes
are not counted in the voting tally.

21

7.9.4 Potential network threats
The structure of the Wagerr network anticipates that some bad actors, given the
opportunity, might attempt to feed bad sporting events outcome data to the network.
Consequences for bad actors: See 7.9.2 Penalized nodes.
The Oracle Masternode network requires multiple checks on contracts to safeguard
against false winners.
The rigid language of the smart contract structure leaves no vulnerable surface for attack.
Supermajority (75% ) vs. simple majority (51%)
Oracle Masternode operators have a deeply vested interest in the security and integrity of
the blockchain, event results, core protocols, and coin code.
Events require 75% network consensus, ensuring that the posted data is highly reliable.
Consider this 75% requirement in contrast with almost all digital currencies which require a
simple majority (over 50%) to be considered “consensus.” Wagerr governance and security
protocols are far more secure.
Major protocol changes require two thirds (66.67%) consensus among Oracle Masternodes.
The ability to acquire this much of the network would be either cost prohibitive, or
logistically impossible due to the anonymity of the system.
Furthermore, even if attackers attained 66.67% of the network, they would have the most
to lose by attempting to manipulate the network in their favor. If they were to change the
rules to produce unfair outcomes, their bad actions would drive the value of the Wagerr
network and WGR token to zero. The more any Wagerr network participant owns, the more
incentive they have to enhance network value — and the more disincentive they have to
harm the network. Again, the transparency of open source code means that any hostile
change would be flagged. The sustained buying pressure necessary to achieve
disproportionate network control would drive up the price of WGR, requiring a huge
investment, such than any attempt to abuse the system would result in catastrophic losses
for the bad actor.
Wagerr eliminates the possibility of low cost network attacks by charging higher fees for
activities that consume resources, but detract, rather than add, value to the network. For
instance:
●
●

The network restricts high volume/small value bets by requiring minimum bet
amounts.
The network also imposes increased fees for small value bets.

22

7.10 Sports data Feeds
Wagerr is dependent on the Oracle masternodes to successfully report real match data
correctly to allow for bets to be posted and resolved correctly. There are multiple ways the
Oracle Masternodes can gather sports fee information. No matter where the source of
information is coming from the requirement of the oracles is to format the data correctly to
ensure the post can fall in consensus with the other Oracle Masternodes on the network.
●
●
●

Sport betting API’s (mostly paid services)
Sport Site scrapes (espn,yahoo,etc)
Manual entry

Sport betting API’s are the easiest and most consistent way to ensure that each Oracle
Masternode reports as accurately as possible and participates in reinforcing the network.
Sport site scrapes are the most complex way for Oracle Masternodes to collect data. They
require the most work but also are the cheapest method. This requires a script to pull data
off of news sites such as Yahoo, ESPN, and CBS Sports.
Manual entry allows the users to directly insert outcomes of unique events. If the operators
watch the game or just want to input the day’s data themselves they can do so manually
through the RPC and virtual interface.
To ensure not all oracles are pulling data from the same source, Wagerr requires the oracle
to report to the network its data source, and, if necessary, the network will force a limit on
each source.
7.11 Network Add-ons & Enhancements
The Wagerr network will contain an ever expanding list of improvements and add-ons far
into the future. The roadmap outlines 3 primary enhancements that are paramount to
Wagerr’s Success.

Rematch Function/friend challenge
Dynamic Odd Balancing
Moneyline betting
Season winner/champions bets
Fantasy Sports Betting

23

7.12 Scalability
Wagerr is a single service blockchain. The smart contracts and the entire network are
designed to accommodate only a limited number of betting and transaction types.
Application Specific Smart Contracts (ASSC) are a rigid class of contracts that allow Wagerr
to know the exact structure of every contract that is proposed and initiated on the Wagerr
blockchain. This allows all parties to have access to contracts that are proven to be safe,
secure, and resolvable.
Wagerr also relies on the contracts to function as phased transactions. When the bets are
made and initiated, the transaction created for contract resolution is already waiting for the
result to be posted, then keying off of that result for the disposition. Once the Oracle
Masternodes come to consensus on an unique event and post the outcome, the contracts
can be completed and paid out in the same block. This allows the network to scale and
process large amounts of bets at the same time without causing a delay in resolution.
IP and hardcoded port requirements ensure that every Oracle Masternode is being
operated on a dedicated hardware server or virtual private server (VPS). In other words,
Oracle Masternode operators are not able to run multiple nodes on a single server. These
requirements ensure the second tier network is both as decentralized as possible, and that
each Oracle Masternode server is adequately powered to handle the Wagerr network load
at any scale.
7.13 Fee Structure
Network fees are imperative for the Wagerr network to succeed long term. Where the fees
go and how they are distributed to the network depends on the types of transactions and
protections in place.
Bet & General Network fees
●
●
●
●
●

Head to Head betting 2% winning side
Multi-User betting 4% winning side
Peerless Direct chain betting 6% winning side
Network transaction fee 0.0001
Bet Minimum of below 1 Wagerr bet fees triple

The fees on the 1st layer are standard 0.0001 WGR to transfer WGR from wallet to wallet to
prevent a DDoS attack of low cost.

8.0 Competitive Analysis
The digital currency space is quickly becoming saturated with projects that create new
tokens and ecosystems. Wagerr stands out more than most of these projects due to the
fact that the network is dedicated to a large single use function: Sports betting. The market
for this single purpose is overwhelming and the demands that it puts on the network and
chain are significant.
Scalability and security are therefore paramount. The only way to achieve this kind of scale
is to be a single purpose blockchain — very good at one thing. For Wagerr to ensure that it
can process and payout thousands of bets on thousands of events a day, Wagerr has to be
efficient and powerful, and not overloaded with functions and features.
In this comparison chart you can see two projects that also use Ethereum technology —
Gnosis, and Augur. Both of these projects differ dramatically from Wagerr in that they rely
exclusively on complex peer to peer (P2P) prediction markets, whereas Wagerr offers
simple and efficient P2P contracts while taking it to the next level with peerless Direct Chain
betting.

The fundamental differences are as follows:
●
●
●
●
●

Designed as a single industry solution
Linking usage to Price (value coupling)
A self correcting deflationary economy
2nd tier network properly incentivized
Rigid smart contracts ensure effective scaling

26

Wagerr accounts for the scaling issues by targeting only one industry and limiting what can
be implemented on the blockchain. Combining that with the rigid contracts of ASSC,
Wagerr can ensure that contracts are not open ended and protect users on all levels.
9.0 Developmental Roadmap
The Wagerr team has been hard at work since September of 2016. Large portions of the
betting engine are complete as well as the ASSC contract system. The Oracle Masternode
posting mechanisms for how they collect and post data is also near completion.
The development of Wagerr is critical to the project's future success. Even though Wagerr is
an open source project and anyone can assist or help build it in the future, the launch team
is committed to the long term vision of the project and will deliver on launch commitments.
●

Late Q3 2017 ​-Testnet released. The Wagerr testnet deploys, allowing players to
preview Head to Head bet matching and general wallet functions. Oracle
Masternode owners can become familiar with their operation and test different
configurations for best results.

●

Q4 2017​ - Head to Head Betting is deployed and the chain goes live. ​The blockchain
mediates bets between two players taking opposite sides on upcoming sporting
events. The fee for an executed contract is 2% of the payout. 1% goes to the
processing Oracle and 1% gets burned.

●

Q4 2017​ - Event Chat Add-on. Every event will have its own chat room that will allow
those who are betting on the event to communicate with one another. Users can get
to know who they are betting against and talk about the event live while it happens.

●

Q1 2018​ - Multi User Betting. ​To make it easier to find and fulfill more bets on low
volume events, the system allows multiple players to be paired against a single
bettor. This ensures that large bets do not require an exact match to forge a
contract. The fee for this transaction is 4 percent. 2% of the fee goes to the Oracle
processing the transaction and 2% gets burned.

●

Late Q1 2018​ - Challenge/ Rematch Add-on. The Challenge and Rematch system
allows the player to message previous betting partners and issue challenges or ask
for rematches. This expands on the concept of an address book by allowing users to
see, track, and rematch past players and easily invite friends to use Wagerr to bet
against one another.

●

Q2 2018​ - Peerless Direct Chain Betting. ​Wagerr gives the player the option to forgo
looking for a match and bet directly against the chain, which takes the other side of

27

the bet automatically. The fee for this transaction is 6 percent. 3% of the fee goes to
the Oracle that processes the request and 3% is automatically burned.
●

Q2 2018​ - Dynamic Odds Balancing. For Direct on Chain betting, Wagerr incentivizes
betting on the other side when one side gets overweighted. This feature allows the
Wagerr chain to ensure that it exposes the network to the smallest amount of
payout liability.

10.0 ICO Details
The Wagerr ICO starts June 1st 2017 and runs until June 25th. The primary goals for the ICO
are to introduce Wagerr to the world in a way that promotes fair, effective, and global
distribution, cultivating rhizomatic decentralization.
10.1 ICO Bonus Structure
Wagerr’s ICO bonuses are structured very differently than the average offerings. Wagerr
designed the bonus structure to incentivize participants that buy in to continue promoting
the offering even after they buy. Wagerr achieves this through having the bonuses be
dependent on the later rounds success.
With up to 20 rounds of sales, a progressive bonus system rewards early adopters while
encouraging word of mouth marketing and the complete sale of each round. Participants in
each round win a 1% bonus at the completion of subsequent rounds. For example, Round
1 participants win a total 4% bonus at the completion of Round 5.. Participants in Rounds
6-10 also have a chance to win Golden Tickets. 150,000 coins are allocated for this special
random bonus.
Example 1
The ICO fully sells out, round one participants would receive a 9% bonus and round two
participants would receive a 8% bonus and so on.
Example 2
The ICO only sells out 5 rounds and ends, participants in round one would receive a
bonus of 4%, participants in round two would receive a 3% bonus and so on.
10.2 ICO Milestones
Funding milestones secure the development of major features on the Wagerr road map.
With the completion of Round 1, Wagerr pledges to issue tokens, and build a Head to Head

28

bet matching system. Completion of Round 3 funds Multi User Betting; completion of
Round 5 secures Direct On Chain Betting.
10.3 ICO Contingencies
If Round 1 is not fully funded by the end of the ICO, the ICO will extend or restart. If Round
10 successfully completes on or before June 14th 2017, the ICO will expand to maximize
distribution and capitalization for development. The ICO will extend by no more than 10
Rounds. The hard cap for maximum token issuance is 200 million tokens.
10.4 ICO Distribution
The amount of coins that are created for the Wagerr chain are all dependent on how many
coins sell during the ICO. Because we do not know the total that will be sold, the ICO
operates based off of percentages to ensure fairness for all. The ICO percentages are as
follows.
●
●
●
●

85% of Available coins are for sale open to the public
4% of Available coins are reserved for bonuses
8% of Available coins are escrowed for the Developers
3% of Available coins are allocated for marketing

11.0 ICO Fund Allocation & Future Development
●

●

●
●

●

Development - Fund continued development of Wagerr, which is vital to the ability
to continue adding new leagues, maintain API advancement, integrate more
accurate results and deeper source pools, and implement new betting types. This is
the largest reserve of ICO funds, ensuring that talent can be attracted.
Marketing - Continue advertising to encourage adoption and usage of Wagerr,
develop positive public relations, pursue partnerships with entities that advance
toward these goals, and promote the advantages of decentralized sports betting.
Legal - Assist with navigating regulations where needed. The main focus will be on
advocacy and lobbying to promote open access worldwide.
Consulting - Hire industry experts from a wide spectrum of sectors including:
Gaming, Business Strategy, Blockchain technology, and Marketing and
Communications to advise Wagerr development, messaging, and overall goals.
Accounting - Ensure responsible management, allow for resources to improve
transparency and accountability, improve overall sustainability, and work with Legal
and Consulting to advance the project.

The funds that Wagerr raises during the crowdsale for the WGR token will be used
according to the chart shown below. Wagerr will be open and transparent about all fund
movements and sales to fund any portion of the plan.

This diagram shows the allocation of funds that are raised via selling WGR in the ICO.
11.1 Developer portion of ICO coins
8% of the coins minted for the ICO will be allocated to the Wagerr developers. 75% of these
coins will be escrowed for the first year and if moved all movements will be shared and
communicated fairly and openly. The remaining coins will be released and split among the
team members and advisors.
11.2 Development Fees
Wagerr was designed to be completely decentralized, and to ensure continuous
development in this tradition, developer fees were built into every single bet. The coins
earned off of these fees will go into a network address that the Oracle Masternodes control
via voting. By having the Oracle Masternode network control these fees ensures that the
Wagerr network will always be able to grow and expand far into the future.
11.3 Future Development
Wagerr is and always will be a fully decentralized open source project. The Oracle
Masternodes governance will allow the network to vote on proposed changes and
improvements. All the development funds collected by its portion of the betting fees (2% of
all the betting fees) are controlled by the Oracle Masternode network. This reality ensures
that Wagerr will always be able to reward ongoing development for generations to come.

12.0 Conclusion
Wagerr is more than just a coin. It’s a technology poised to disrupt the entire sports betting
industry — and a revolution in the design of digital currency economies.
Wagerr pairs cutting edge blockchain technology with a new take on an industry
desperately in need of decentralization.
Traditional sports betting requires participants to entrust valuable assets to untrustworthy
individuals and organizations constrained by unpredictable regulations, often in
jurisdictions that criminalize the core practice. The risks of sports betting are absurdly
compounded. The pure fun of sports betting lies in trying to predict an uncertain future.
But legacy betting models multiply what bettors put at risk, regardless of the outcome of
the sporting event — their assets, their freedom, their lives are all in jeopardy from crooked
bookies, law enforcement, and predatory loan sharks. Centralized systems are excessively
risky, excessively costly, unpredictable, and unfair to bettors, and often even unfair to
licensed participants in the regulated betting industry. When power is centralized in
governments, corporate or private books, the bettor is so dependent on the reliability of
unreliable elements that sports betting is actually a bit crazy. It doesn’t have to be that way.
Wagerr offers not only a decentralized sports betting blockchain, but also a sustainable
economy that produces, perhaps for the first time, a digital asset in a decentralized
economy with the full functions of a currency. Wagerr is:
●
●
●

a ledger,
a medium of exchange, and
a decentralized store of value.

A match made in blockchain heaven.
Putting these two achievements together — disrupting the sports betting industry and
revolutionizing digital currency — what we get is a decentralized sports betting network
that dramatically improves the conditions of sports betting. And as long as a modest
fraction of the trillion dollar sports betting industry adopts the Wagerr network for betting,
the value of the central token, WGR, will systematically be sustained in a relatively stable
growth trajectory with dynamically moderated volatility. Sports betting and the blockchain
were meant to be.
Wagerr is the future of sports betting. The future of sports betting belongs on the blockchain.

1. Ecosystem of digital
currency exchanges
1.1 Overview of digital currencies
and exchanges
By 26 June 2017, 941 kinds of digital currencies were
recorded on Coinmarketcap and the total market
capitalization exceeded $100 billion, which is 50
times larger than 5 years ago. Since 2017, growth
rates of market capitalization and volume traded
for the top 20 cryptocurrencies has been 383% and
985% respectively.

Currently, East Asia, North America and Europe
are the biggest markets of crypto currencies. The
percentage of trading volume for the three markets
is about 63%, 25% and 11% respectively. The price
of coins differs among these markets. In East Asia,
Bitcoin and Ethereum are often sold at a premium
of 3-5%. Early in July, Ethereum in South Korea was
nearly 10% more expensive than the global average.
By contrast, the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum in
Europe and North America are lower than the global
average.

The secondary market has witnessed the growth
in value of digital currencies. There are around 98
digital currency exchanges and tens of millions of
active investors worldwide.
According to Coinmarketcap, 24h trading volume
was over $4 billion on 26 June 2017.

1.2 Industry pain point: the isolation
of exchanges
For regional reasons, fiat currency, language and
the investment environment, digital currency
exchanges tend to be localized and isolated. Not
all digital currencies are available to customers in
every region and the prices vary quite substantially.
In addition, services provided by exchanges differ
and not all trading information can be found on
the open market. This becomes an obstacle to
cross-country or cross-region trading, clearing,
deposit and withdrawal – a major inconvenience for
investors.
Furthermore, this could affect global digital currency
liquidity, market-oriented distribution and best
price discovery, limiting the nature and advantage of
digital currencies.

2. Overview of
Exchange Union
2.1 Vision and mission
To bridge digital currency exchanges around the
world and realize investors’ cross-exchange trading,
cross-exchange clearing, deposits and withdrawals
among different digital currencies and assets.
Improve trading efficiency and performance
of exchanges and realize the market-oriented
distribution of digital currencies’ liquidity and best
price offers.
First, bridge exchanges in terms of trading, deposits,
withdrawals and clearing through agreements
among digital currency exchanges and offer
discounts on transaction fees ; provide deals
on credit and margin trading. Soon afterwards,
build Exchange Union Chain and realize the full
interconnection among digital currency exchanges
through blockchain technique. Meanwhile, we will
sustain the ecosystem and branding of Exchange
Union Chain. As the mandatory, we will help
manage the Exchange Union Chain; assets and team
for the holders of XUC.

2.2.3 Technical process
• First step
i. Invest in digital currency exchanges around the
world
We will make strategic investments in digital
currency exchanges in order to build the Union.
ii. Synergies will be developed amongst members of
the Union (on a contractual basis).
XUC will be traded on exchanges in the Union.
On the backend, the Union will have a unified
system which contains, for example, order
books; customers’ portfolios; KYC information,
etc.
Intra-union communication and information
sharing will be executed by HTTPS/ WSS/ FIX.
Clearing within the Union will be done through
XUC.
User Case scenario: Alice will pay the trading
fees with a cross-exchange transaction by
XUC. The trading fees will be shared between
Exchange A & Exchange C according to the
rules and agreements within the Union and
will make real time clearing.
iii. Why XUC?
No exchange has the complete list of different
digital currencies. XUC serves as a “universal coin”
among cross-exchange and multi-currency trading.
• Second step
i. The Union will build the Exchange Union Chain
and set its own consensus algorithm. To be
considered valid, transactions will need to be
approved by at least 80% of the Union. This process
should take less than 1 second.
