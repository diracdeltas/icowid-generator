the project progress

Preface | Heal the Internet Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web
(WWW) and recipient of the 2016 Turing Award, issued a statement in 2017,
indicating that the Internet is deviating from its original intention. Yes,
there has been something wrong with the Internet for years. At the time when Tim
Berners-Lee invented the Internet, the Internet was a fully decentralized
platform, in which anyone could create content, webpages, websites, and freely
interact with others. However, the Internet has developed from a simple
academically-researched sharing network into a stunner that governs business,
communication, entertainment, and information. The Internet's power structure is
also changing. Undoubtedly, the Internet belongs to large corporations, rather
than the public, t hat define the rules of the Internet. These corporations
include Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple, as well as Alibaba and Tencent in
China. Internet traffic, data, and content are becoming concentrated because of
corporate giants like Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Snapchat, while China
focuses on Apps, including Wechat, Toutiao.com, Taobao and QQ. These giants own
and benefit from the numerous data created by billions of users throughout the
world, and maintain the power to create what users read, gain, and desire.
Giants, other than users themselves, own the ability to control data. The data
no longer belongs to its creator. Due to the inappropriateness of an attempt to
retake data initiatives and the difficulty in building websites and Apps, we
have to adopt the rules of WeChat and Facebook and the distribution mechanisms
of Weibo and Twitter, thus 1 losing our own features. Although an App can be
self-made, Apple can easily withdraw it from its platform. However, it is never
easy to destroy a person, a thing or a cause. The Internet is no longer fully
decentralized, and it has even become more centralized than the old forces which
have been overturned by it, including newspapers, magazines, and records,
because newspapers may be collected, but micro blogs are not backed up. TRON is
an attempt to heal the Internet. We believe users should have ownership of and
control over the data they create, rather than have to cede that ownership and
control to the platform; users must freely own all digital information. We
believe users must have the final power to make a decision on whether to read
and access content, and information must be distributed on a free and volunteer
basis, at the user's choice. We believe users must be entitled to the incentives
of digital assets - using data on a free basis, which will no longer be bound by
any platform, and be protected by a decentralized Internet. All of these are
facilitated by the decentralized protocol called TRON. TRON is an action against
the centralized Internet, and while this endeavor will be difficult, we believe
the fight is worthwhile. Because a truly decentralized Internet is a laudable
goal.

1. What is TRON 

TRON protocol is the blockchain's entertainment system of free content, in which
TRX, TRON's coin, is circulated. Its native economic system enables an
unprecedented one-on-one interaction between providers of digital entertainment
content and ordinary users. Therefore, content providers will no longer need to
pay high channel fees to centralized platforms like Google Play and Apple's App
Store. Also, providers of content such as texts, pictures, videos, and
broadcasts, will break the curse that popularity and hits cannot create cash.
With the strengths of social network and value network, TRON is committed to
ecological prosperity. In relation to any community and free market economy, an
incentive system that fairly and reasonably reflects the contributions made by
participants is fundamental. TRON will attempt to accurately and transparently
measure and motivate relevant participants and contributors using digital assets
for the first time, thus enabling this content ecosystem.

2. Value of TRON 

In designing TRON, the following core values are: 1. Data creators (users) will
have the fundamental ownership of data, and the Internet should be
decentralized. This was proposed by Tim Berners-Lee at the time when the
Internet was born. 2. Those who make a contribution to the TRON ecosystem will
be entitled to proportional profits for their work, according to rules. A value
network that can digitally capitalize on anything in social and media networks
has the greatest potential. 3. All forms of contribution should be of equal
quantitative value. Substantially, the time invested by participants, excellent
content, and attention are as valuable as furnished capital. 4. The fundamental
objective of TRON is to provide services for the public. As an ecosystem
operated by a non-profit foundation, TRON is designed to serve the masses
throughout the world who enjoy content entertainment, rather than gaining
profits. 5. Content should derive from people rather than capitals, and content
should be used to reward people rather than to control people. Cultural and
creative industries should be driven by the pursuit of the quality of art and
content by content creators, artists and scriptwriters, rather than the
capitalists who do not consume the contents.

3. Infrastructures Provided by TRON

TRON seeks to provide relevant participants with the following
infrastructures: A High-quality content platform Social network that provides a
link among all people Digital currency as a bridge Payment network; and
Autonomous ecosystem

4. Characteristics of TRON 

As a decentralized content protocol, TRON subscribes to the following basic
characteristics compared, in contrast to the centralized Internet: 1. Data
liberation: on a free and uncontrolled basis, the contents including characters,
pictures, audio and video may be uploaded, stored and spread. 2.
Content-enabling: digital assets are obtained through provision and distribution
of content, thus economically stimulating the content ecosystem. 3.  Personal
ICO: an individual may freely distribute digital assets in the form of ICO,
while others may enjoy the benefits and services brought due to the continuous
development of contributors' data by purchasing digital assets. 4.
Infrastructure: distributed digital assets will be equipped with a complete set
of decentralized infrastructures, including distributed exchange, autonomous
gaming, forecast, and game system.

5. How to Achieve Economic Stimulation of Content Development Through TRON

Fundamentally, the TRON design requires the monetization of the content economy.
The TRON mechanism is based on economic stimulation of content development and
monetization of the content in an encrypted manner. Economic stimulation
achieved through cryptology may greatly contribute of a content platform, and it
is believed to the growth that cryptocurrency could unprecedentedly stimulate
the content development ecosystem. TRON will propose a set of improved mechanism
to evaluate an individual's ecological contribution. Most existing platforms
adhere to the principle of one-user one-vote, which easily cause repeated voting
and the request for control of junks and attacks. Existing content platforms
have been controlled by profit demands and centralized mechanisms, and the
content we read is that which the centralized platform wishes us to read, rather
than what we wish to read. Due to the unfair algorithm of information flow,
Weibo, Toutiao.com, WeChat, and Facebook are gradually becoming controlled
tools. Advertising platforms are the first profit-gaining mode, among which
Phoenix Nest, advertiser's recommendation algorithm of Toutiao.com, advertising
system of WeChat, promotion program of Weibo, and advertisement channel of
Taobao are typical profit-gaining modes and unable to enable the content which
attracts traffic. However, with TRON, the economic stimulation system is
expected to become a circulatory system in a decentralized manner, enabling
users to have a platform to enjoy demands. their favorite content without
conflicting with profit

TRON's autonomous system will also unprecedentedly enable ecosystem members,
thus forming an autonomous ecosystem rather than the current flat-user
mechanism. TRON only allows the users who involve themselves in the periodic
unfreezing of TRX to cast a vote on the platform's ecological management and
decision-making. The TRON Platform is currently operating. We believe that under
this model, over time, community members will be encouraged to hold TRX for the
long term, which will maximize the TRON Platform's long-term value. 

6. Realization Path of TRON

While the initial TRON platform is currently up and running, it is expected to
take 8-10 years to implement the entire TRON system, a large program involving
six steps. Specifically, the realization path is as follows: 1. Exodus, Data
Liberation A mechanism of upload, storage, and distribution which is based on
peer-to-peer and distributed content. In the Exodus phase, on the basis of the
distributed storage technology represented by IPFS, TRON will provide users with
a completely free and reliable platform for data publication, storage and
dissemination. 2. Odyssey, Content Empowerment Economic incentives, empowerment,
content ecology and blockchain technology will create a fully competitive
economic mechanism with fair returns for content creation, distribution and
dissemination. Therefore, individuals can be encouraged and contents can be
empowered, thus constantly expanding the boundary of the system. In the
centralized Internet system and in the vast majority of cases, content producers
earn cash through advertising models. But the efficiency of obtaining cash has
been extremely low because the user experience is seriously dampened by the
annoyingly strong advertising push mode. Other content has also confronted
trouble. Despite cash being gained through tipping and gifting for other
content, content producers' profits are deducted by 30%-90% due to a lack of a
paying system. What's worse, because they are hindered by the randomness of the
tipping model, most content providers cannot break even. Content creators are in
urgent need of a content protocol with a self-paying system. Access to content
can be measured by payment, and the payment and purchase are based on the
transparent records of a blockchain. 

TRON protocol is the blockchain's entertainment system of free content, in which
TRX, TRON's coin, is circulated. Its native economic system enables an
unprecedented one-on-one interaction between providers of digital entertainment
content and ordinary users. Therefore, content providers will no longer need to
pay high channel fees to centralized platforms like Google Play and Apple's AppA
Store. Also, providers of content such as texts, pictures, videos, and
broadcasts, will break the curse that popularity and hits cannot create cash.
The tipping model focuses on the popularity, and popularity increases as the
tipping increases. The distributed clearing and storage mode will also enable
developers and content providers full freedom of creation, without being
restricted by centralized managers. In the TRON system, content producers can
have direct access to TRX, the TRON coin paid by fan users for premium content.
They can also obtain influence and power by creating high-quality contents, thus
directly gaining TRX rewards given by the system. An example of a value score of
user operation that heavily weights content distribution: Calculation formula of
weights of operations such as hit (1), like (2), comment (3), tipping (4), and
forward (5)  = user's energy value during the jth operation. User's energy value
will
constantly decrease when the user frequently operates specific interactions over
a certain period; the value will slowly increase when the user stops the
operation, thus limiting the click farming dynamically on the basis of the
user's credit among the community as a whole. A user's credit score will be
downgraded if he or she is repeatedly reported against or receives complaints.
= user's available TRX balance during the Jth operation. User's current
 = user's credit score during the jth operation. The score is calculated
available TRX balance is obtained by his or her current TRX balance deducting
the amount locked by the system. The larger the available TRX balance is, the
higher the value score of the user's interactive operation. The purpose is to
prevent malicious users from registering multiple blank accounts for click
farming. 1 2 = Threshold value of operation
 = at the moment of t, times of the ith operation
 = the total number of user's various operations during the jth operation
For creators of live-show-like instant contents, the block chain technology can also
display the anchor's popularity in a transparent and fair manner and obtain
real-time and rapid income through intelligent contract. The technology can
avoid problems triggered by the centralized platforms, such as the black box
operation, account delay and block for no reason. The problems damage the
interests of the anchor and the audience. An example of an anchor's
sharecropping of the intelligent contract on the live platform: pragma solidity
^0.4.11;
contract TRONAnchorPay { // 
address platform; function TRONAnchorPay() { platform = msg.sender; }
function deposit(address anchor) public payable{ uint for_anchor = msg.value * 9
/ 10; uint for_platform = msg.value - for_anchor; anchor.transfer(for_anchor);
platform.transfer(for_platform); } //  90% function withdraw() public{
assert(msg.sender == platform); msg.sender.transfer(this.balance); } function()
payable{} } With TRON's structure of bottom blockchain, TRON can issue their own
tokens freely, and thus is equipped with a native economic system. Through
TRON's official token, TRX, users can easily achieve value distribution,
payment, and settlement of content. The system can also motivate users to
produce content with clearer 9 copyrights and high quality, which enables the
content output system's fine self-operation. 3. Apollo, Free Movement of
Value--Decentralized Token Trading Exclusively for Individuals To reach the goal
that each content producer in the TRON system can issue their own tokens, the
system must have a complete solution for de-centralized tradings,thus realizing
the values. The platform will face the following challenges: 1. As time passes,
the number of tokens issued on the platform will significantly increase, making
it difficult for traders to screen.  Traders may become easily confused or even
cheated. 2. Despite the very small amount paid by individual supporters, the
total number of supporters is huge, who have high requirements for the safety of
platform funds. However, the system will prevent phenomena like hacker attacks
and absconding with funds on the platform. 3. Because the logic of distribution
of interests varies from that of tokens, the platform needs to promptly complete
reminders and have quick delivery. 4. Transaction history needs to be open and
transparent, so that participants can understand the whole process and have
sufficient information, thus reducing transaction risks. The current centralized
exchange cannot respond to these challenges, especially in regard to the rapid
trading of mass-type tokens and risk management platform funds; therefore,
decentralized of trading platforms are needed to complete deals. Not all funds
are handled by centralized trading platforms, but instead, they are always
stored in traders' accounts, perfectly solving for third-party custodian risk -
problems like funds being stolen or money being absconded; on the other hand,
through the peer-to-peer content-addressable protocol decentralized and
distributed, traders can that is easily and accurately find mass and exclusive
tokens without confusion. 

Through the establishment of the decentralized trading platform, the system's
value, property rights, and risks can be freely traded and exchanged, thus
increasing the economic vitality of the entire system in geometric multiples. 4.
Star Trek, Traffic Monetizing--Gaming of De-centralization and Market Forecast
The size of the global gaming market in 2014 exceeded $450 billion. Traffic on
the TRON network will make it possible to build an online gaming platform for
de-centralization. Developers can freely build online gaming platforms through
TRON, providing fully autonomous games and predicting market functions. 5.
Eternity, Traffic Conversion--Decentralized Game In 2016, the global video game
market was to $ 9.66 billion, of which the scale of the phone game market was $
4.61 billion, accounting for 42%. TRON provides the possibility for establishing
an on-line game platform. Developers can freely set up game platforms through
TRON, achieve crowd funding for game development, and common investors can
contribute to game content creation..

7. Technical System of TRON

1. File Storage Protocol TRON's bottom layer consists of a group of multi-layer
protocol stacks with various implementation models for each layer and is
integrated in modules. Corresponding interface standards are defined between
layers, including the following five levels:      name layer: a self-certified
PKI namespace MerkleDAG layer: data structure format Exchange layer: block
transmission and copy Routing layer: locating peer nodes and objects Network
layer: establishing connection among peer nodes 



Node and identification 1) "TRON node" is the program that can locate, release
and copy MerleDAG. TRON network adopts node identification based on PKI (Public
Key Infrastructure); the node is shown as NodeId, which is the Ciphertext Hash
of Public Key. Node will store its public and private keys (private key will be
protected by password). Users can freely establish and initiate a "new" node in
every boot, which will deprive the network the profit achieved from former node
running. The system has an incentive mechanism to make users maintain the same
node. type NodeId Multihash type Multihash []byte // self-describing
cryptographic hash digest type PublicKey []byte type PrivateKey []byte //
self-describing keys Type Node struct { NodeId NodeID PubKey PublicKey PriKey
PrivateKey } The generation mechanism of NodeId is as follows: difficulty =
<integer parameter> n = Node{} do { 12 n.PubKey, n.PrivKey = PKI.genKeyPair()
n.NodeId = hash(n.PubKey) p = count_preceding_zero_bits(hash(n.NodeId)) } while
(p < difficulty) When the connection is established, the nodes will exchange
public keys among each other and, check if the hash of node public key is equal
to the NodeId hash(other.PublicKey) equals other.NodeId of peer node, if not,
the connection will be terminated. 2) Multihash and updatable hash All hashes in
TRON will be encoded with multihash, which is a self-describing hash format. The
hash function should be used in accordance with specific security requirements.
The encryption system is updatable, which means the system can switch to a
stronger hash algorithm when a current hash function cannot meet more strict
security requirements. But there is indeed a price to be paid, the object needs
to be rehashed and the connection needs to be rebuilt. This way of not defining
the length of a hash digest in advance allows for the tool used today can to
work normally even if it is switched to a longer hash function tomorrow. The
hash digest value is stored in multihash format, including a short header,
specified hash function and byte length of digest, For instance: <function
code><digest length><digest bytes> The current TRON node must support the
following hash algorithm: sha2-256, sha2-512 and sha3. 3) Network layer Provide
point-to-point reliable and unreliable transmission between two TRON nodes, and
process:  NAT traversal--punching, port mapping and relaying 

  

Support various transport protocols--TCP, SCTP, UTP... Support encryption and
digital signature Multiplexing--multiplex connection, stream and protocol...

4) The routing layer: locating peer nodes and data Routing layer serves for two
purposes:   Node-routing--searching for other nodes Content routing--searching
for data released to TRON.

Routing layer defines an interface, and all implementations meet or realize the
interface can be linked to TRON, for instance: DHTs, mdns, snr, dns. The
corresponding interface definition is as follows:

5) Block swap: transmitting content-addressable data TRON's block swap layer is
responsible for data transmission coordination. Once the nodes are aware of each
other and establish connection, content-addressable blocks can be transmitted
through swap agreement. Note that the term "swap" in this context does not refer
to a swap in the sense of a finaical market transaction as defined in the US
Commodity Exchange Act. It is a technical term of art dealing with the TRON
platform code's distribution of content. The block swap layer is the interface
definition, and all implementations meet or realize the interface can achieve
seamless access, for instance:  Bitswap: current implementation, which is the
generalization implementation of BitTorrent, supports the swap of any DAG; HTTP:
simple HTTP implementations can be used between HTTP clients and servers.
BitSwap is a block transmission agreement similar to BitTorrent--where nodes
represent the expected block set with want_list, and represent the data block
set they can provide with have_list. Unlike BitTorrent, block swapped by BitSwap
is not limited to a single torrent. BitSwap serves as a persistent market, nodes
exchange blocks through BitSwap market, the node can obtain their favored block
sets, and these block sets may be completely unrelated files from the file
system. Sometimes, in exchange, a node may have no blocks needed by other nodes,
and it will help find blocks it needs ­ these get the needed block from each
other, and such incentives can help the cache and distribution of rare blocks.
BitSwap credit The agreement must urge the nodes to be the seed because they
might not have the blocks needed by other nodes. Therefore, BitSwap nodes will
actively deliver blocks to other peer nodes, and the agreement must prevent the
existence of greedy nodes that load little and never share their blocks. A
simple system similar to credits can solve these problems. (1) An node track its
number of bytes exchanged with other nodes. (2) Nodes transmit blocks to
indebted nodes in form of probability, the higher the debt of indebted node is,
the lower probability of block transmission will be. It should be noticed that
if the node decides not to transmit a block to the opposite end, then it cannot
transmit a block to the ignored correspondent node within the following
ignore_cooldown time. This prevents the submitter from escaping from repeatedly
sending blocks. BitSwap strategy The node's strategy to send blocks directly
influences the performance of block swapping. It should meet the following
objectives: (1) Maximize the node and the overall transaction performance; (2)
Prevent greedy nodes from taking advantage of or reducing the swapping
performance; (3) Efficient and exclusive to other strategies; (4) Be friendly to
the credit node. A practical strategy selection is Sigmoid function, the defined
debt ratio r is:

At a given r, the probability of sending to indebted node will be calculated as:

The sending probability drops dramatically with the rising of debt ratio. Debt
ratio is the measurement of credit, which is friendly to previous nodes that
have swapped many blocks and unfriendly to unknown or untrusted nodes. BitSwap
accounts The BitSwap node will keep accounts of block swaps, which helps node
track history and avoid being cheated. When connection is established, the 
BitSwap nodes will exchange account information. If the information is not
matched exactly, the accounts will be deleted and reinitialized, and all profits
and debts will be lost. This method seems to have a loophole for malicious nodes
to delete debts by way of intentionally "losing" accounts, but that is
impossible because nodes cannot accumulate enough debts. Furthermore, it will
lose all the previously-accumulated debt, and other nodes will consider it
abnormal behavior and refuse to swap.

The account information history will not influence the normal operation, and
only recent account items are useful. The node can also choose store or not to
store historical information. 2. Self-operation of Storage Network TRON is a
centerless storage network, which turns the storage from cloud model to market
model based on algorithms and rules. The market is based on blockchain and trade
in virtual currency: the miner earns TRX by providing storage for clients; on
the contrary, the clients spends TRX to hire miner to store and dispatch data.
Similar to Bitcoin, offered by miners, which provides a useful client-side
service (unlike Bitcoin, the miners' work is only useful for blockchain
consensus) and is a strong incentive to drive miners to contribute as much
storage space as possible to client-side rent. The agreement will integrate
these resources into a self-healing storage network for external use, and the
network will realize its robustness by copying and dispersing stored content and
automatically detect and repair replication errors. The client side can choose
different replication parameters to protect data according to different
threat degrees and levels. The storage network also provides other security
guarantees for clients such as end-to-end encryption of content, and the storage
provider cannot obtain the decryption key.

1) Proof-of-Replication (PoRep) algorithm The server (prover, P) convinces the
user (verifier, V) that its data D is replicated and stored in multiple physical
storage locations. Seal operation Seal operations include: (1) getting the
public key of verifier's stored data through asking verifier to prove the
pseudorandom and force the data copies to be correctly stored in independent
physical storage; and (2) force the time required by copying the process to be
longer than the expected time required by responding to a Challenge. PoRep
algorithm flow Create a copy: create a copy in Setup algorithm through the Seal
operation and provide the proof of successful execution.

Storage verification: The Prove algorithm produces storage verification for the
replica. The prover receives a random challenge c and determines one leaf Rc of
Merkle Tree R (root is rt), the prover produces the proof of Rc and the Merkle
path to rt.

Verification proof: Verify algorithm checks the validity of the storage
verification based on the data copy of the Markel tree root and the hash of the
original data. 

The verification is publicly verifiable: any distributed system node interested
in this data can check the validity of the storage verification.

1) PoSt algorithm flow The Setup of PoSt is similar to Verify algorithm and
PoRep. The Prove algorithm produces Proof-of-Spacetime for data copy.

The prover receives random challenge from verifier and orderly generates
Proofs-of-Replication, then uses one proof output as the next output until t
times of loop iteration, as is shown in the following picture:

PoSt. Prove mechanism displays an iterative proof that is effectively stored for
a period of time. 

3. Network Implementation of TRON Contents Through the use of many existing
mature technologies, wave field (TRON), as a new content platform, provides
security, scalability, and privacy, and simultaneously allows the participants
to actively contribute to the processing capacity of their machine to build a
user registration network. It also gives positive contributors the privilege to
send advertisements to the whole network to incentivize (of course this group
text messaging will be limited in number). 1) The user registers P2P network
Centerless, through but secure user registration, is implemented the blockchain
mechanism, and the same mechanism has been applied in Bitcoin without the need
for central authorization, which avoids double spend difficulties. The
blockchain ensures no duplicate registration, and the newly-registered users
must obtain the confirmation of multiple blocks before taking effect, i.e.
notarization. Each block is defined as:

H (Blocki) provides proof-of-Work to prove that the user received satisfying
Nonce value in Noncei space through violent solving; meanwhile occasional hash
collision is avoided through verification. The difficulty of solving is
determined by the difficulty value, and the number of blocks generated per hour
is automatically set by the system, which is similar to the Bitcoin network.

New user j must broadcast UserRegj when registering online, and after receiving
the broadcast message, other nodes must prove the proof-of-Work of H (UserRegj),
which will prevent denial of service attacks by false registration. This
workload is much smaller than the workload of the blockchain; t yp i c a l l y,
a few minutes of computation can solve the problem. 

The blockchain provides a mapping from the user name Usernamej to the user
public key PUBKj, a dictionary that can be publicly queried. The node must
verify the uniqueness of Username j before adding Usernamej to the new block,
but there is an exception : if the newly- registered key is signed by the
previously known public and private keys, then it may be replaced. In addition,
the IDj uniqueness and the proof-of-Work of UserRegj should be also proved when
receiving the new block. Usernamej also has the maximum size and the allowable
character limit to protect the ID space from the hash attacks. SpamMsgj is a
broadcast message (called "Promoted" message) that sends the Promoted message as
a reward to nodes that actively participate in block generation. 2) Routable DHT
overlay network The second network is a P2P overlay network similar to Kademlia,
which is mainly used for resource storage and searching content, and also for
direct delivery of notifications between users. Using the user's ID as the
network node ID seems like a good choice, but this leads to the exposure of the
user's identity and location, breaking the system's privacy. Therefore, hashing
the IP address and the node's port number to identify the node and taking it as
the node's name in the DHT network can also avoid the sybil attack:

The package delivered from IDsrc to IDdst in DHT network is defined as follows:

The payload is signed through user IDj, the IDj may be different from other
users of IDsrc during package retransmission/refresh. 

These functions constitute the third layer function of the concept model of the
DHT overlay network. The above layer is the "application layer", which provides
the data storage primitive to PUT and GET, PUT is defined as follows:

Before accepting the storage request, the destination node needs to do the
following rule checking:     IDdst = Htarget ensure the correct calculation of
the destination address; IDdst is the neighbor of IDnode that actually receives
the request; IDj = Howner: verify when restype is "single"; seq is larger than
stored old value seqold, which is also verified when restype is "single".  time
is a valid time (i.e. not a future time value).

Restype defines resource types. There are two possible values, "single" and
"multi." Single represents resources that can only key owners can update; mult i
represents responses from different users (i.e., replies to a post). For a
single type, the node stores only a single value, and for the multi type, the
new PUT request appends the value to the list. Both types of storage can set the
expiration time, and the corresponding storage will be deleted from the system
after the setting time, so that the expired data will be automatically cleared.
Primitive data retrieval GET can also operate on two types of storage resources,
other non-storage resources related to the dynamic content also can achieve
similar access operations, so as to share the same API interface. 3) User
contents The k-th message of user j is defined as: 

MSGk is content, k is a monotone increasing number, possible values of type
include: the new posts, replies, retransmission (RT), direct messages (DM),
REPLYk is an optional domain, which provides reference of the original message
in response /retransmission and is defined as:

representing the original message is the k'-th message of the user j'. The
contents are simultaneously shared in two overlay networks: (1) stored in DHT as
a short-term storage value; and (2) archived like files in BitTorrent network.
When the new content is created, the client-side must send a PUT request to the
following addresses:

IDUserPost_jk is the destination storage node's address in the second DHT
network, providing the retrieval capability of any content. IDswarm_j is the
gateway address of torrent swarm group related to the content of the user
Usernamej in the third network, and this torrent contains all the content of a
given user j, which provides quick distribution and sharing of content based
BitTorrent protocol and is independent of the second DHT network. The neighbor
node of IDswarm_j needs to join the swarm cluster of user j to help the storage
and distribution of content, provide data reliability and better data
distribution performance; similarly, the neighbor node of IDUserPost_jk also
needs to store the same values stored by IDUserPost_jk. The swarm group
mechanism solves the problem of fast and efficient notifications and
distribution of new content, so that the user's followers don't have to always
poll the DHT network address to determine whether new content is generated.
Direct message (DM) 

Users posting content can also be delivered by direct message, but only if the
message receiver is a follower of user k.

Except the for the content difference(now is [PUBKl(DMk ) H(DMk)]) , there is no
difference from regular posts. DM will only be received by user l who has
successfully decrypted. Although other followers can also receive the message,
they cannot decrypt the message, nor can they perceive who is the final
receiver. Encryption is based on the ECIS elliptic curve encryption algorithm.
User content torrent/tracker rule  In hashing space, the online neighbor nodes
within a certain distance from IDswarm_j need to join the corresponding Swarm;
When IDswarm_j's neighbor receives new content from the DHT network, it must
work as a gateway for BitTorrent network to incorporate content into a file-like
archive structure;  BitTorrent tracker is read-only multi-value list storage.
Its hash address is calculated as:

The follower of user j should join in the corresponding swarm to receive
real-time content update, so as to obtain the address of the initial Peer
through the primitive GET query of IDtracker_j;

IDtracker_j is different from other storage values because it is read-only,
which prevents the tracker attack and contains the swarm members' privacy. The
list of IP addresses is obtained through the swarm protocol, which requires the
online neighbor node of IDtracker_j to join the swarm.

Swarm members can only know each other through IP address, and BitTorrent does
not provide any information about the user name. 

There is no need for the hash of all user contents, because the contents
(including DM) have been signed to verify the integrity of the content;

The added value k when generating new content is broadcasted directly through flooding in the Swarm;

Members of the Swarm will exchange the content lists, where members can choose
to save or request only the most recent content;

The seed node is the node selected to archive the content; A content publishers
(user j) can choose not to be member of the swarm group (to protect privacy and
hide IP address);

If the publisher chooses to be a swarm member, it does not have to follow the
IDswarm_j gateway mechanism, which will22 expose its own IP address;

Even if the publisher becomes a swarm member, it may not have to act as a seed node;

The new block generation rate will impact the user's posting speed, and if a new
block is generated every 10 minutes, on average, 288 contents blocks can be
released daily. 4) User mention mechanism If the new content refers to user j,
the client-side also has to send a notification to IDj, including the entire
message content, to be routed through the DHT network. The mention mechanism is
the only function in the system that needs to be addressed by user IDj instead
of IDnodej, which may expose users' privacy information. An alternative
implementation mechanism is as follows:

The user name is hidden hash and a new address for receiving and accumulating
all mention is calculated, IDmention_j neighbor nodes will also 25

participate in the storage of mention, providing maximum reliability and storage
performance. A bad thing about this approach is that the user needs to poll this
address periodically to determine if any new mention is received. The mention
mechanism requires the collaboration of the client-side, and if it does not send
notification messages to the network, the user will not perceive that he has
been mentioned. 5) Explicit message request User l can request a specific
explicit message from user j without joining Swarm group through directly
retrieving the corresponding contents from IDUserPost_jk address of the second
DHT network, it supports functions of "message upstream". 6) Message downstream
A downstream trace of the message (such as a reply/RT query for a specific
content query) is relatively difficult to resolve, and a possible solution is to
send a notification to a storage address of a multi-valued list

The stored value is the copy of all responses, which also requires the client
sides to work together. 7) Hash tag Like the mention mechanism, the hash tag
detects in the context of the new message, and the copy of the message is sent
to a specific multi-value list storage address:

This is similar to a message downstream mechanism, but the difference is: the
hash tag creates a new Swarm group; and IDhashtagt neighbors must also join this
virtual Swarm. It is called virtual because the Swarm group does not share any
file content and is only used to realize the broadcast function for users who
want to monitor the hash tag. 8) Content search A search for any content that
appears can be realized by extending the implementation of the hash tag to build
a similar mechanism for the content that appears. In order to reduce overhead
and network transmission, corresponding restrictions must be attached, such as
restricting content size and excluding prepositions. In addition, it can
significantly reduce the storage overhead and the system implementation
complexity if the unified storage of content containing the same content is
stored in a temporary multi-valued list address. The address calculation is as
follows:

TRON content provides the following security, extensibility and privacy
features:  The architecture itself provides elastic extensions, and no single
company, government or organization can close it;  The distributed user
registration mechanism is as secure as Bitcoin transactions, providing
non-centralized content authentication;  Users are more eager to register early
so they can select their favorite user name,.  The common user naming method and
discarding the long encryption hash allow users to have a better use experience.
Public key substitution mechanism allows users to change their key pair when
security is threatened;  The main functions of other blogging systems are
included, such as user name search, message tracing, mention, encrypted message,
hash tag and content search. 

The ability to send notifications to and request resources from specific user
via DHT routing, whether the user is online or not;

The architecture provides incentives for participating nodes to have the
privilege of sending broadcast messages;

Users' public content and hashtags can be accessed through read-only web
interface, which does not break the security of the system;

Resource-constrained client sides can be optimized, for example, by not storing
all blockchains but only the hash values of the blocks. In order to search for a
particular user, they can inquire network which block contains the user's
registration, and the client-side only have to download the desired block
without reducing security and verify data integrity through some branches of the
Merkle Tree.

8. TRX--Official Token of TRON

TRON's official currency is TRONIX. TRON will own the following categories of
assets extended from TRONIX: (1) TRONIX TRONIX is the basic unit of accounts in
TRON's blockchain. The value of all other tokens is derived from the value of
TRON. Those who wish to enter or exit TRON must buy or sell TRONIX. TRONIX's
total distribution is 100 billion. (2) TRON Power (TP) TP is locked TRON. Users
can acquire TP by locking their TRONIX. TP, in nature, is TRONIX with voting
rights, which means TP holders have more privileges in the ecosystem. In the
world of cryptocurrency, we see speculators constantly seeking fast-appreciating
currencies for investment. TRON tries to build an ecology under the full control
of TRON holders who are optimistic about TRON on a long-term basis, and we hope
TRON could be controlled by those whose values are consistent with TRON's over
the long term. As time passes, we'll give TP holders more TPs as a reward, and
the reward will be dynamically allocated. This means that those who hold and
lock TP for the long term will be rewarded. TRON POWER's balance cannot be
transferred nor sold, which TRON POWER is not tradable.  Long-term investment in
TRON's direction is critical for the ecosystem to make long-term plan and not
give up the pursuit of its ideal for short-term interests. Meanwhile,
stakeholders enjoy the sustainable growth. Long-term holders can be the
benchmark in the ecosystem and better lead the ecology's development. (3) TRON
20 TOKEN Content owner ICO: Content owners (IPs, individuals, and groups) can
freely issue their digital assets, using TRON 20 standards, while others can buy
these digital assets and enjoy the benefits and services brought by the constant
growth of data contributions. Tokenization is a way of defining value in
blockchain and is used to benchmark financial or digital assets. On TRON, we
suggest all tokens use the same standards, TRON 20, which will make it easier
for the token exchanges and DAPP suppor means

On the basis of TRON's blockchain, the community will also support some
development of DAPP, the decentralized exchange, market forecasts, random
digital sources, and other ecological projects.

9. Transaction Confirmation and Community Governance

The blockchain transaction confirmation mechanism is critical to the system's
self-upgrading. When the protocol layer changes, the ecosystem will decide to
follow the longest chain. Existing voting mechanisms are inefficient and
sometimes fail to make most nodes vote, leading to stagnant decision-making.
TRON is the first to propose a mixed-voting mechanism and set a two-tier voting
system, 1. Poll 2. Follow vote TRON's nodes communicate with each other, but
they can confirm the transaction at different times. Blockchain requires the
uniformity of sequences, which means every transaction's time sequence must be
uniform. To ensure the uniformity of every broadcast round, TRON's voting system
needs to take three steps: 1. Preliminary Preparation When a user sends an
application for transaction, the host node will send a message to all
verification nodes and wait for a reply. 2. Preparation A verification node will
check this message. If consensus is reached with a two thirds affirmative votes
or more, the host node will broadcast that the transaction enters the next
stage.  30

The verification node will have three response options 1) The node approves the
transaction 2) The node rejects the transaction 3) The node doesn't reply within
the required time 4) Nodes that do not respond often will be eliminated 3.
Confirmation

A verification node officially promises that information is correct. Then, if a
consensus is reached with a two-thirds affirmative vote or more, the transaction
will be completed, and the blockchain will link with co-chain and broadcast it
to all nodes in the network.

12.Compliance

Operator

As followers of Tim Berners-Lee, the TRON team firmly believes that the Internet
belongs to all humankind since the day the protocol was born, instead of a
profitable tool for a fraction of people. Therefore, TRON established Tron
Foundation in Singapore, with the primary task to operate the TRON network
publicly, fairly, transparently, and not for profit, and offer support to TRON's
development team. Tron Foundation's establishment was approved by Singapore's
Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and is supervised by
Singapore's corporate law. This Foundation is independently managed and run by a
fiduciary board or management committee and is independent of the government.
The Foundation does not have any commercial interests to support or participate
in public interest or private interest activities. The "profit" earned by the
Foundation is deemed surplus and will be kept as outlays for other activities
instead of being distributed among its members. 2. Governance structure and
voting

The Foundation has set up a three-tier organization structure to ensure the
reasonable use of funds and resources to promote openness, justice, and
transparency; to constantly advance the rapid growth of TRON protocol; to extend
the application scenarios of TRON protocol; and to attract more institutions,
companies, and organizations to enter the open-source TRON ecosystem:

Decision Committee

CEO

R&D

Product Design & Production

Ecosystem Operation

Marketing

Financial Audit



Decision Committee

Decision Committee is the supreme decision-making body of the TRON Foundation
and assumes the final decision. There is no seniority among the Committee
members. The Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving the
Foundation's major affairs, such as strategic planning, annual plan and
budgeting, and vote on major issues in the T R O N p r o t o co l ecosystem on
behalf of the Foundation.  CEO

The CEO is elected by the Decision Committee and is responsible for the
Commission. The CEO will comprehensively organize and implement the decisions
and regulations of the Decision Commission and is responsible for TRON's daily
operation, reaching all targets assigned by the Commission, and reporting their
implementation to the

Commission/Committee on a regular basis. Moreover, the CEO has the right to
establish functional departments when necessary and organize and employ
managers. The CEO is responsible for the business of five departments, including
R&D, product design and production, ecosystem operation, marketing and financial
audit, forming a CEO-centered organizational, and management system.  R&D
Department

The R&D Department audit is responsible for the development and of underlying
technology and is the Foundation's basic department.

To ensure that team members exchange information and act in concert, R&D should
exchange information with other departments (particularly the product design and
production department) and timely adjust and communicate project details and
decide the direction of future research.  Department of Product Design and
Production

The Department of Product Design and Production is responsible for enriching and
perfecting product frameworks, provided by the technical department, making
specific sustainable development strategies, including conducting market
research and planning product functions, and TRON's UI design and graphic
design, and other works. The Department staff needs to follow trends, hotspots,
community feedback, and proactively communicate with token holders and hold
activities like occasional technical seminars.  Ecosystem Operation Department

Based on what technical and product departments provide, the Ecosystem Operation
Department is responsible for "the external and the internal." The Department
will extend the depth of work, actively develop partners, and closely link TRON
with end-users and partners, thus building an open, distributive, and
privacy-protection global entertainment ecosystem. The Department will also
build an ecosystem within the user community with benign interaction, free flow
of information, and information symmetry.  Marketing Department The Marketing
core are Department i s products responsible and for marketing TRON's and
derivative not limit services.

Its duties include, but designing user interaction, and other tasks. The
Department works closely with Ecosystem Operation Department to formulate a
publicity programe, based on the requirements of partners and end-users.
Finance Department to, contacting and cooperating with media, advertising,

The Finance Department is responsible for the company's financial affairs,
including funds management, financial accounting, and cost control. Because
digital assets feature high risks, this Department is also in charge of risk
management and control and will coordiante with other Departments to analyze and
evaluate pro ject s' operational and financial risks. Because of the
particularity of digital assets and tokens, it is difficult for existing
institutions to supervise them in an effective way; therefore, the Decisio n
Committee will engage professional auditors to ensure open and transparent use
of TRX.

14. Risk

Systematic risks: They refer to possible changes caused by common factors of
overall importance, which will impact the success of all blockchain companies in
the same way. A policy risk: at present, the government has not formulated an
explicit policy about blockchain projects and ICO financing, so participants may
suffer from losses caused by future policies. . At the same time, systematic
risks also include a series of force majeure factors, which include, but are not
limited to, natural disasters, large-scale breakdowns of global computer
networks, and political unrest.  Supervision absence risk: Digital asset
transactions, including TRX, have extremely high uncertainty. Due to lack of
forceful supervision in digital asset transactions, electronic tokens are
subject to sharp rises and falls.  Risks after supervisory regulations are
formed: It cannot be denied that in the near future, supervisory regulations
will be formed to restrain the fields of blockchain and electronic tokens. If
supervisory and regulatory bodies perform a standard management over these
fields, the electronic tokens purchased during the ICO period may be affected.
The impacts include, but are not limited to, price and stability fluctuations
and restraints.  Inter-team risks: At present, there are numerous teams and
projects in the blockchain technology field, so the competition is very fierce.
There is strong market competition, so whether the TRON project can stand out
among many excellent projects and be widely recognized will not only depend on
the capacity and vision/planning of its own team, but it will also be determined
by numerous competitors in the market. There is a likelihood of competition.
Risks within the team: TRON has gathered a talented team full of vitality and
strength experienced and attracted senior practitioners and technical developers
in the blockchain field. Because we playa leading role in the Chinese ICO field,
team stability and cohesion is of vital importance to TRON's overall
development. In the future, there is a possibility that TRON will be negatively
impacted by resignations of core personnel or conflicts within the team.  Risks
about project coordination and marketing: The TRON founding team will spare no
efforts to realize the development goal proposed in the white paper and expand
the growth space of the project. At present, TRON has a relatively mature
commercial model analysis. However, due to unpredictable factors occurring in
the overall development trend of the industry, existing commercial models and
coordinating thought are not well compatible with market demands, thus
considerably decreasing the profits. At the same time, this white paper may be
revised with updated project details. If the ICO participants fail to obtain
details after project updates in time or if the public fails to fully understand
the project due to information asymmetry, the subsequent development of the
project will be impacted.  Risks about project technologies: First, this project
is based on a cryptographic algorithm. The rapid development of cryptology will
inevitably lead to risks of system cracks. Second, cryptology's core businesses
are supported by technologies like blockchain, distributed ledger,
decentralization, and. The TRON team cannot fully guarantee technological
fulfillment. Third, loopholes may be found during project upgrading, which can
be remedied through a patches release. However, the degree of being impacted by
loopholes cannot be determined.  Risks about hacker attacks and crimes: In
regard to safety, one individual is very small, but the overall number of people
is great. This has placed a high priority upon the project's security assurance.
Because they have characteristics like anonymity and immutability, tokens may be
used by criminals and/or hackers for criminal activity.  Other risks unknown at
present: With continuous development of blockchain technology and the overall
industry, TRON may face some risks that cannot be predicted at present.
Participants should fully understand the team background, know about the overall
framework, and the project's concept before making a decision. They should
manage their expectations and participate in token distribution reasonably.
