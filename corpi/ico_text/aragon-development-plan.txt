  IntroductionAragon is everything you need to run organizations (companies, NGOs, foundations, open source projects...) on the Ethereum blockchain. It implements features like a cap table, token transfers, voting, roles, fundraising and accounting. Aragon organizations are easily customizable, and they are also extensible by installing third party modules.Aragon organizations will be able to opt-in into the Aragon Network, which will provide services like upgradeability and a decentralized court arbitration system for Aragon organizations.For more information, please refer to our website our dapp white paper and our Networkwhitepaper.This document describes how Aragon Dev plans to develop the Aragon dapp, the AragonNetwork and how Aragon Dev is positioned in the larger context of the Aragon project. aragon.one Page2  of1 5Development Plan      
 History & VisionLuis and Jorge have been dreaming of a decentralized world for years. They met via Twitter when they were only 15 years old, and immediately started building products together.At the age of 17, they prototyped a fully decentralized Internet replacement by using mesh networks, blockchain technology and protocols like Bluetooth LE and WiFi Direct.Stampery—Luis’ latest company—made blockchain timestamping accessible, and hasworked with institutions like the Estonian government, Microsoft and Telefonica. It participated in TechCrunch Disrupt and was backed by billionaire Tim Draper.Luis has also been recognized as a 30 Under 30 by Forbes and Innovator Under 35 by the MIT.Before building Aragon, Luis and Jorge were in Silicon Valley working on solving the problem of patent trolls with Unpatent. After figuring out how broken the underlying infrastructure of innovation is—patent trolls thriving, Donald Trump winning the elections, bureaucracy eating entrepreneurship—they decided to focus all of their time in building the infrastructure that new companies and organizations will run on top of. aragon.one Page3  of1 5          
    When talking about Aragon, taking a step back and thinking about the why of organizational structures like companies is a sane move.Firms or companies exist in order to create value by using resources to create products or provide services.However, intermediaries and third parties such as governments decrease the output of those organizations by imposing restrictions and creating complex regulatory frameworks. Aragon was born to disintermediate the creation and maintenance of companies and other organizational structures.Luis and Jorge were very inspired by Nobel prize Ronald Coase and his amazing paper TheNature of the Firm and Yochai Benkler's Linux and the Nature of the Firm. Both explore the concept of company.At Aragon Dev, we believe that the blockchain and the Internet are changing the incentives for companies to exist, and we are building tools for the next generation of companies that will take advantage of these changes.However, for decentralized organizations to be widespread, we need to make sure that they are easy to use, upgradeable/durable and able to resolve human disputes.We want to solve—either us or partnering with others—those points in order to make decentralized organizations widespread.And, thanks to the Aragon dapp and the Aragon Network, we can solve those points.aragon.one Page4  of1 5       
 Organizational Structure   Aragon CommunityAragon MTU Aragon Dev  Aragon Community, defining the community members contributing to the dapp and Network and the Aragon Network Token holders.Aragon MTU, from now on, the Foundation, a non-profit organization based in Estonia, will serve as the umbrella organization responsible for allocating resources to other bodies for future cryptocurrency research and development going forward. The board of the Foundation consists of Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo. The Foundation will focus on overarching the mission and will enable operating organizations to accomplish the day-to- day work.The Foundation will also serve as a governance entity that will listen the Community until the Aragon Network is fully operational, from where the full governance of the Network will be transferred to the ANT holders.Aragon Dev, a for-profit corporation that will be founded after the token sale is finished, and will serve the Foundation and employ a team that will work on the Aragon platform. It will also serve as a service provider for the Aragon Network.Funding Priorities It is intended that the Foundation will deploy the revenue from the token sale as depicted in the Intended Use of Revenue document, but it reserves the right to make changes if it deems them necessary. aragon.one Page5  of1 5   
 Development MilestonesWe will divide development milestones in the form of releases.Each release may have multiple deployment stages, from being in alpha stage—running on the test network—to begin in the production stage—running on the main network—going through multiple testing, security and QA stages.0.1 — The Initial Release This the first release on macOS after months of work and weeks of privately-conducted community testing. Featured all the basic functionality that an organization needs to operate. It was not made public.Release Calendar• Private Alpha: February 2017aragon.one Page6  of1 5     
 0.2 — The Public Release This was the first public release. Working in both macOS, Linux and Windows. Introduced a new UI styling and Kovan testnet support.For more information, read the launch post.Release Calendar• Private Alpha: February 2017• Public Alpha: March 2017aragon.one      Page  7 of  15
 0.3 — The Governance Release This version added the Bring your own token functionality, that allows using Aragon with any ERC20 token as a governance token—ERC20 is a token standard allows everyone to interface with a variety of tokens in a common way. It also added two new bylaws, specific address only and ask oracle contract for confirmation—stepping stone for more dynamic bylaws.It introduced delegate voting and creation of custom, complex stock classes.It featured new iconography, notable startup time improvements and web browser support for using it with Ethereum browsers/clients like Mist, Parity, MetaMask, Status etc.Release Calendar• Alpha: April 2017aragon.one Page8  of1 5     
 0.4 — The Money ReleaseThis release will focus on adding:Economic abstractionCompanies will be able to hold and interact with any standard value-holding tokenImproved budgeting and accountingOrganizations will be in itself the organization's bank account. DividendsDividend sharing with shareholders, if desired.Fundraising tokensCompany will be able to raise funds in the form of tokens, not necessarily ether. More flexible founding routes.Funds vaultFinal funds vault API, the only part of the company that is not expected to change. This will make upgradeability easier, being able to redeploy significant parts of the organization while maintaining its access to the funds.Release Calendar• Alpha: June 2017• Bug bounty (mainnet): From July to September 2017• Private Beta (mainnet): October 2017This will be the first release that gets deployed to the mainnet.After 3 months of public bug bounties in the mainnet, we will start allowing the firstcompanies to be created using Aragon in the mainnet. aragon.one Page9  of1 5     
 0.5 — The Modular ReleaseBlockchain projects that have already manifested interestThis release will focus on adding:Organization-wide encrypted datastoresUsing a connector for IPFS/Swarm, we will provide a second layer that will give storage capabilities to the dapp. This way, new features and UX sugar will be able to be added to the organizations. Example: setting a company’s logo, or implementing an organization-wide identity system, instead of public ones.Front-end modules APIThis will let developers build modules for Aragon that extend its functionality.Core modules APIThe API will let the developer trigger actions inside the organization itself, and access more low-level capabilities.Module developer incentives planWe will provide a module store and incorporate an incentives system for developers to be rewarded.Release Calendar• Alpha: September 2017• Private Beta (mainnet): December 2017 aragon.one         Page  10 of  15
 0.6 — The Upgradeable Release This release will focus on adding:Full upgradeabilityOrganizations that will be able to run as long as the Ethereum blockchain runs. No matter if big chunks of functionality are swapped.Different upgrade tracksWe will provide different upgrade options. This is what we are targeting:• Automatic upgrades: The network will automatically upgrade the organization.• Delegated upgrades: A representative appointed by the org will upgrade it.• Upgrades by voting: A majority of voting power will approve upgrades.Release Calendar• Alpha: December 2017• Bug bounty (mainnet): January 2018• Private Beta (mainnet): February 2018 aragon.one Page1 1of 15     
 0.7 — The Network Release This release will focus on adding:Basic network-wide governanceWhich power the network will have over organizations, governance votings to decide on service providers, payouts functionality.ANT token mintingThe network will be responsible for the minting policy of ANT, it will be decided through the governance of the network. Some of its responsibilities will be to decide the issueing rate, the price and how companies pay for the subscription to the network.Initial Aragon Dev proposalFirst proposal by Aragon Dev to Aragon Network for funding and further development milestones.Integrate upgradeabilityProvide upgradeability as a network service for all Aragon Network organizations.Release Calendar• Alpha: March 2018• Bug bounty (mainnet): April 2018• Production deploy (mainnet) : May 2018 aragon.one     Page  12 of  15
 0.9 — The Unknown Release This is a wildcard release. The ecosystem is evolving very quickly and we don't know what interesting features we may want to add that will make the 1.0 release more appealing.Some ideas of what we might work on here:Privacy-focused companieszkSnarks could provide companies with way more privacy. Private voting and ownership are very interesting concepts we are researching about.Different governance mechanismsUntil now Aragon companies and the Network will be simple liquid democracy based entities.We are closely following research and experimentation on other governance mechanisms such as Futarchy.aragon.one Page 14of1 5    
 1.0 — The Release We expect to start marketing Aragon to the mainstream with this release. To achieve that mission, we will have to place an important focus on design and user experience. aragon.one Page  15 of  15
