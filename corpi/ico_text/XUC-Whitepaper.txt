 1. Ecosystem of digital currency exchanges1.1 Overview of digital currencies and exchangesBy 26 June 2017, 941 kinds of digital currencies were recorded on Coinmarketcap and the total market capitalization exceeded $100 billion, which is 50 times larger than 5 years ago.

 1.2 Industry pain point: the isolation of exchangesFor regional reasons,  at currency, language and the investment environment, digital currency exchanges tend to be localized and isolated. Notall digital currencies are available to customers in every region and the prices vary quite substantially. In addition, services provided by exchanges di er and not all trading information can be found onthe open market. This becomes an obstacle to cross-country or cross-region trading, clearing, deposit and withdrawal – a major inconvenience for investors.Furthermore, this could a ect global digital currency liquidity, market-oriented distribution and best price discovery, limiting the nature and advantage of digital currencies.2. Overview of Exchange Union2.1 Vision and missionTo bridge digital currency exchanges around the world and realize investors’ cross-exchange trading, cross-exchange clearing, deposits and withdrawals among di erent digital currencies and assets.Improve trading e ciency and performanceof exchanges and realize the market-oriented distribution of digital currencies’ liquidity and best price o ers.First, bridge exchanges in terms of trading, deposits, withdrawals and clearing through agreements among digital currency exchanges and o er discounts on transaction fees ; provide dealson credit and margin trading. Soon afterwards, build Exchange Union Chain and realize the full interconnection among digital currency exchanges through blockchain technique. Meanwhile, we will sustain the ecosystem and branding of Exchange Union Chain. As the mandatory, we will help manage the Exchange Union Chain; assets and team for the holders of XUC.  4

 2.2.3 Technical process• First stepi. Invest in digital currency exchanges around the worldWe will make strategic investments in digital currency exchanges in order to build the Union.ii. Synergies will be developed amongst members of the Union (on a contractual basis).XUC will be traded on exchanges in the Union.On the backend, the Union will have a uni ed system which contains, for example, order books; customers’ portfolios; KYC information, etc.Intra-union communication and information sharing will be executed by HTTPS/ WSS/ FIX.Clearing within the Union will be done through XUC.User Case scenario: Alice will pay the trading fees with a cross-exchange transaction by XUC. The trading fees will be shared between Exchange A & Exchange C according to the rules and agreements within the Union and will make real time clearing.iii. Why XUC?No exchange has the complete list of di erent digital currencies. XUC serves as a “universal coin” among cross-exchange and multi-currency trading.• Second stepi. The Union will build the Exchange Union Chain and set its own consensus algorithm. To be considered valid, transactions will need to be approved by at least 80% of the Union. This process should take less than 1 second.     7
  Benefits of the Exchange Union ChainMore secureBuild by leading digital currency exchanges, consensus algorithm is secure and credible.SCheaperNo transaction fees on Exchange Union Chain.                   FasterQuick transaction con rmation on Exchange Union Chain.ii.
