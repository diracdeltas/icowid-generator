Its main goal is to integrate cryptocurrencies into the traditional  nancial world and to create a single gateway to the market for common users, traders, investors and  nancial institutions. This is the cryptocurrency liquidity center featuring a whole range of add-on services meant to improve users’ experience. All Exscudo services are connected to the liquidity center via the company’s own blockchain EON - this measure makes them more secure and transparent than existing cryptocurrency exchanges. The EON blockchain platform enables the whole system to be transparent without disclosing bank secrecy.We are building a new  nancial ecosystem, that’s why we do not want to attract venture capital to  nance our product. We are going for an ICO instead, attracting the crypto community to be our stockholders. Every EON coin holder can start his or her own node, deposit the coins and get the commission from the transactions processed by the node.Exscudo strives to make operations with cryptocurrencies legally compliant both for individuals and  nancial institutions, making it easy for them to enter the cryptocurrency market. 4
 INTRODUCTION. THE CHALLENGES OF TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETSTraditional Financial MarketThe traditional market has a complex structure, it is archaic and overly regulated. Here is an outline of how it looks like today:The access to it is rather complicated for an individual. Besides, it involves a long chain of intermediaries, where everybody charges commissions, making the access to the market for those who would like to trade quite pricy. Such a structure prevents small individual capitals from entering the market.Everybody has faced this problem if he or she tried to transfer money from one country to another or any other kind of international transaction - sometimes commissions are as high as 10% or more!With cryptocurrencies the commissions are minimaland are equal to some fractions of a percent, and there is no threshold. The system makes microtransactions possible, which are quite problematic on the traditional market. Thus, what is left for the majority of small market5
 INTRODUCTION. THE CHALLENGES OF TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETSparticipants are high commissions, high spreads and exchange di erences.Nowadays capital markets tend to be simpler, direct access to capital for market participants, eradication of intermediaries and lower commissions.Once the suitable technologies for the realization ofthese needs emerged, the market began to actively implement them. Thanks to blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies it becomes possible to renew the market entirely.Appeal of Cryptocurrencies for the Traditional Finance MarketInvestment protection in times of crisis is one of the most important investment skills. Whenever some kind of natural, political or  nancial crisis breaks out, gold remains one of the best investment of your capital. Traditionally, gold and other precious metals are considered one of the best ways to hedge risks. However, cryptocurrency has recently become attractive from6
INTRODUCTION. THE CHALLENGES OF TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETSinvestment point of view as an alternative to hedge against local political, economic and market risks. In addition, the growth potential of cryptocurrency is huge. High market volatility is attractive for traders. These assets have earned the reputation of an attractive object of high- risk and high-yield investments.Low Penetrationof the Traditional Banking SystemAnother problem of the traditional  nancial system is low penetration of banking systems around the world.According to recent studies of McKinsey&Company, about 2.5 billion of adult population all over the world do not have access to banks and micro nance institutions.However according to the International Telecommunication Union, 47% of the world’s population, or 3.4 billion people have internet access. Thus, for a great number of people, more than 2 billion around the world, the best tool to be involved in the global economy is to make online cryptocurrency transactions.Challenges of the Cryptocurrency MarketSince 2009 the cryptocurrency market has gone from the very beginning to the formation of the basic structure. Despite the fact that the market has evolved, its members continue to face a number of di culties at both technical, legal and product levels.States endeavor to monitor the  nancial system and prevent the economy from growing in the gray zone. Due to the fact that many cryptocurrency projects operate in an unregulated area, states refuse to consider cryptocurrency as a means of payment at the national level. This is the reason for all the major legal di culties of the cryptocurrency market. For this particular reason institutional investors can not enter the market because of concerns regarding client due diligence, the lawson anti-money laundering and other issues that arise in connection with the cryptocurrency pseudonymous nature. 7
INTRODUCTION. THE CHALLENGES OF TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETSTechnical issues are associated with the complexity of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies for everyday users. There are few convenient integrated products on the market, which could become a single point of access to the market for everyone.It is di cult for an average user to create a cryptocurrency wallet to keep his assets safe.Some other technical issues are related to scalabilityof existing blockchain technologies, bandwidth, thesize of blockchain and vulnerability to SPAM attacks. Besides, a number of modern cryptocurrency exchanges were created by enthusiasts, which were not pro cient in the sphere of IT-security which results in possible vulnerabilities of the exchanges.Some technical di culties are also connected with the consensus algorithm: PoW (proof-of-work) leads to the mining centralization; and existing PoS (proof-of-stake) consensus algorithms allow use of various types of attacks.One cannot deny the issue of hyper-volatility of markets in conditions of limited supply. With high regional fragmentation of markets, isolation of funds of the exchange order books (with separate margin trading and separate exchange operations) and the absence of a large and single center of liquidity, market makers can easily manipulate cryptocurrency prices.In addition, the fragmentation of the market a ects the issue of the optimal price choice. Traders need to gather information from dozens of websites, web forums and other sources to make a simple choice concerning the price.Another urgent problem of cryptocurrency markets lays within the lack of high-tech solutions with a high degree of technical security and legal protection of assets, high- performance architecture platforms and professional tools for trading. This is another reason why institutional investors still cannot enter the cryptocurrency market.Because of all the problems mentioned above the spread of cryptocurrencies on the traditional  nancial marketis rather low. These challenges limit the involvement of 8
INTRODUCTION. THE CHALLENGES OF TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETSnew user segments, which slows down the penetration of cryptocurrency into new regions.According to the latest Juniper Research, by 2019, the number of active Bitcoin users can get closer to 5 million. However, now the blockchain network has reached its capacity limit of 350 thousand con rmed transactions per day - if we compare it with the traditional  nancial market, then PayPal at the same stage of development had more than 100 million active accounts, all this despite the fact that it worked with a less developed IT infrastructureand besides required passport data of the user for authentication.investment point of view as an alternative to hedge against local political, economic and market risks. In addition, the growth potential of cryptocurrency is huge. High market volatility is attractive for traders. These assets have earned the reputation of an attractive object of high-risk and high-yield investments.There is a large number of start-ups, but the market is still undergoing its infancy. There is a lack of professional and user-friendly, scalable infrastructure products for the propagation of cryptocurrency to the mass market and involvement of users from the classical market. 9
EXSCUDO PROJECT MISSION DESCRIPTIONThe main goal of the project is the integration of cryptocurrencies with the world of equity and  nancial markets. We strive to let every person who has access to the Internet into the cryptocurrency market simply, quickly, legally and securely. Exscudo solves almostall of the aforementioned problems found on the cryptocurrency market:Trading and InvestmentA long chain of intermediaries on  at exchanges may ruin your trading experience. 2.5 bn people worldwide are unbanked and do not have access to any  nancial system.Exscudo provides an opportunity to trade in the open market with minimal commissions from any device connected to the Internet. Users can invest, trade, purchase and manage funds from one single account.Versatile Trading ToolsMany cryptocurrency exchanges are limited only to buying and selling currencies and o er the same trading interfaces for beginners and experts.The Exscudo exchange features web, mobile clients and a professional trading terminal. The interfaces are both user-friendly, adaptable to the needs of experienced traders and include all the necessary graphs and indices.Data SecurityThe majority of wallets and exchanges are susceptible to hacks. Data transmission and storage becomes even more challenging.Exscudo solves the problem of security. EON,our proprietary blockchain platform, provides for independence, decentralized data access and transaction encryption. Exscudo Channels is a safe way of messaging and transferring money. 10
EXSCUDO PROJECT MISSION DESCRIPTIONLegal ComplianceInstitutional investors do not enter the cryptocurrency market due to legal restrictions. This is also one of the reasons why retail companies do not accept payments in cryptocurrencies.Exscudo grants  nancial institutions legal access to cryptocurrencies. Our Merchant Platform lets stores accept cryptos. To comply with international and national legislation, Exscudo is getting all necessary licences in the country of residence in the EU.Our task is to provide users with professional tools for legitimate trading, ensuring a reliable technical and legal protection of their  nancial assets.We are creating a center of cryptocurrency liquidity -a market in which people without access to banking ecosystem can just buy and sell digital assets as easily as institutional investors.Exscudo’s main task is to provide an ultimate trading and exchange functionality for di erent client groups:Simple operations and one-click services for those who only need a simple way to buy or sell cryptocurrencies;Advanced functionality with automatic trading and unique strategy development tools for professional traders;Simple gates and other features for stores and cryptocurrency ATM networks.Another one of Exscudo’s priority is to grant private and institutional investors access to operations on both crypto and  at currency markets that are fully compliant withthe corresponding rules and regulations. This means that we are integrating our payment system with the banking system. The underlying technology is EON, a blockchain network developed specially for  nancial applications. EON has the functionality of smart transactions that handle the interaction of the elements of the Exscudo Ecosystem.    11
EXSCUDO PROJECT MISSION DESCRIPTIONEvery user can monitor the anonymized transaction history in the blockchain through the block explorer. This grants the transparency of capital  ow and eliminatesthe necessity of trust to  nancial reporting of the exchange, since any transaction can be viewed in the open blockchain. This innovation makes for transactions transparent and prevents any possible fraudulent activities by the payment operators.                                                                                                                                                       The Exscudo ecosystem includes a number of services- tools for both private investors in crypto-currencies and for  nancial institutions.

The powerful trading system allows traders to opt for complicated strategies.EONTo gain independency from third-party developers, Exscudo uses its own distributed network called EON. This technology allows Exscudo to handle transactions between the Exscudo Stock exchange and international banks, as well as cryptocurrency wallet users and  at accounts holders. EON is the fuel that empowers the whole system. It uses smart transactions algorithm that is similar, but not equal to the smart contracts mechanism of the Ethereum network. For security reasons, only the Dev team will be able to add new smart transactions to the network at this stage.EON is not a fully open source project, but the parts that cover the rules of the consensus, emission and block con rmation will be published on Github. The part that deals with the Exscudo Stock Exchange is classi ed. You can learn more about EON on its website.Thanks to our EON blockchain, market participants have direct access to the capital market. Exscudo’s goal isto provide everyone, even unbanked people, with the opportunity to enter the market on an equal basis with institutional investors and professional traders.EON gives a number of advantages to the  nancial market:ecosystem simpli cation;fast clearing;low operating costs;low counterparty risk;transparency and veri ability;friendly software development environment.       21
DETAILED PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONExscudo Channels: Secure Chat-walletThis is one single application that unites the functions of a multi-currency wallet and an encrypted messenger. It allows for easy access to the personal account and  nancial services of Exscudo. The multicurrency wallet allows the user to manage cryptocurrency accounts at any place and time. It helps execute internal transfers between accounts with instant conversion on the exchange at market rate and to make payments through NFC on mobile clients (PayWave).The payment systems are integrated with the liquidity center which allows them to use the relevant exchange rate, a minimum commission for conversion, as well as to reduce the time for conversion and the time period required to transfer the funds to the account.Decentralized messenger for secure communication and the option to make  nancial transactions directly on the chats. You can communicate con dentially and transfer funds safely, simply by sending a message to your contact. Despite the usual private conversations, users can create and join free and paid public and private channels. This provides a wide range of opportunities not only for cryptocurrency users, but also for media, bloggers and public persons.How EON Blockchain Conducts Transactions of Exscudo Channels AppA user is sending a message.His or her contact is receiving the message.1. The user enters the message and hits ‘send’ button;2. The message is encoded with the public key of the contact;3. The encoded message is sent to a peer;4. The peer lists the message as ‘unveri able’ (which is not included in the blockchain);5. The message is transmitted to other peers;a. If the message contains text, ‘5-handshake’ rule works: 22
DETAILED PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONi. every peer chooses a random peer every second;ii. that random peer transmits all the messages to the current peer;iii. all the received messages are listed as ‘unveri able’.b. If the message contains a payment transaction, it will be included in the blockchain:i. the peer generates a block;ii. the transaction in the block becomes veri ed;iii. this blockchain spreads to other peers.6. The contact`s peer receives the message;7. The contact requests all the unreceived messages from the peer;8. The message is received by the contact`s device;9. The message is decoded and displayed in the chat.                                                                                                                                          23
DETAILED PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONDebit CardsDebit Cards are connected to the user account and provide the option to pay and exchange currencies in real time.This is the most simple connection for the user between the classical  nancial market and the cryptocurrency market. Simply deposit the  at or cryptocurrency on your account in the Exscudo wallet and the card is ready to be used. The currencies are exchanged for the price of the Exscudo Exchange at the moment of purchase. The card is accepted all over the world for online purchases and in brick-and-mortar stores with minimum commissions.Merchant ToolsIt is the fastest, safest and cheapest payment method for clients in terms of commission. the merchant features low commission, compared to  at currencies and a multitude of supported cryptocurrencies for payment.It has ability to generate reports for points of sale. This is a solution for business entities that are willing to accept cryptocurrencies and may or may not wish to deal with them directly.

EON NETWORK BRIEF DESCRIPTIONUnfortunately, existing blockchain systems could not give us enough  exibility, functionality and independence from third parties, which motivated us to develop our own blockchain platform - EON.EON is a decentralized blockchain-based platform that provides the infrastructure for the Exscudo services. This platform is not an alternative for Bitcoin, Ethereum and any other altcoin - it was created to solve speci c tasks within the Exscudo system. Some existing blockchains either do not have any long-term roadmaps, or have  aws in their architecture.EON is not superior to any leading blockchain-based platforms, but it enables Exscudo to be independent and launch new functions when it is needed.The architecture of EON is based on a simple core. The core calculates a math model and has a number of services connected to it. These services add more functionality to the Exscudo system.EON blockchain is not open source, 95% of the code is proprietary. However all the parts concerning consensus rules, coin emission and block con rmation will be published on GitHub. Open source code allows the community to audit these parts of the system, create their own coins based on EON and to integrate their projects into the Exscudo system.EON Blockchain Basic PrinciplesData ExchangeAll the nodes are passive. This means that the system does not use any broadcasting to spread information among the nodes. Data exchange is performed according to two principles:1. Storage of new user transactions;2. Requesting nodes to share new data.There is no node which ‘knows’ everything about the system. It just connects to random nodes.If the node which receives request behaves outside the framework de ned by the model, it is placed in the black 30
EON NETWORK BRIEF DESCRIPTIONlist. After some time the blacklisted node will go into ‘read only’ mode - it will not participate in the generation of new blocks. If there are several such nodes, then after a while they will be ‘sorted out’ from the main network.The algorithm of data distribution over the network provides for their random spread, i.e. no one can  nd out from which particular node the data came into the network. The node checks all incoming data: if the transaction does not have a valid signature, or does not pass the parameter check, it is rejected and not processed. Each transaction type is checked in accordance with its logic.TransactionsThe term “transaction” is used to denote a data packet signed by the sender, which contains a descriptionof some action - an atomic change in the state of the system. Any particular action of a user is sent to the system by means of a particular transaction.EON transactions, unlike Bitcoin transactions, do not have locking scripts. Instead, explicitly de ned user pro le links are used to identify the sender and the recipient.Each transaction contains the following data:its creation time;its lifespan time in case it is not included in the block;base transaction link, which is included in the blockchain earlier;recipient address;commission amount in EON coins; the data itself;sender address;sender signature.SignatureDigital signatures are based on the elliptic curves algorithm EdDSA, or rather its accelerated and enhanced         31
EON NETWORK BRIEF DESCRIPTIONversion - Ed25519. This algorithm was developed and implemented by Bernstein (https://cryptojedi.org/papers/ ed25519-20110926.pdf).For transactions performed on behalf of an aggregator pro le, a multi-signature is used. For example it can be a “settlement account”, the withdrawal of coins from which is carried out by voting of several managers.AccountsThe term ‘account’ is used to refer to a memberof a system that can act as a sender or recipient of transactions. Transactions sent on behalf of an unknown account are not accepted for processing.Each account has an address. This address is formedon the basis of a public key. The state of the accountat a particular time is determined as the result of the execution of a sequence of atomic actions described by transactions.To register a new account, the system uses a transaction of the appropriate type which allows you to transfer the data necessary to verify the transactions sent on behalfof this member to the network. In addition to saving the above data, this will eliminate the danger of sending coins to a non-existent account.The registration transaction does not contain a commission, this moment opens technical possibilitiesfor organizing a DDoS attack. Protection is ensured by the fact that registration transactions have a minimum priority and are included in the block last.ConsensusNew blocks are added in equal time intervals.Each node can o er its own variant of a new block,if it has synced its chain with at least one more node.To perform chain synchronization between nodes, a comparison between their cumulative complexity is made and the more complex variant is chosen.   32
EON NETWORK BRIEF DESCRIPTIONThe cumulative complexity of block B is calculated by the following rule:D=Dprev+bal(A’)*M/hash(hash(Bprev),A)1. It takes generation signature (hash Bprev) in the previous block.2. To verify the ownership of the address, it is signed using the user key of the generating block (A).3. The scope of the hash function (M) is divided by the value obtained from the  rst 8 bytes of the signature.4. To obtain a new cumulative complexity, multiplication of the value obtained at step 3 and the amount of deposited funds (balA ‘) is made.5. Complexity of the previous block (B prev) is added.In view of the fact that keys corresponding to users are publicly known, each participant can check the complexity himself.It is clear from the equation that there is a restrictionon the signature of blocks in the network. Blocks in the network can only be signed by delegates who must con rm their obligations by depositing funds through issuing the relevant transaction. The size of the deposit must exceed the minimum value in XXXX coins (the exact value will be announced at the o cial launch of the network).A delegate can withdraw the deposited funds through a reverse transaction. The delay in withdrawal of funds from the deposit (the duration of the guarantee period) exceeds the maximum depth of branching.Half of the fee for the released block, which is equal to the amount of commissions for all block transactions, is sent to the account that issued the block for its generation. The other half is distributed according to the algorithm.You can  nd more details about the rules of the EON network in the o cial whitepaper on the website http://eontechnology.org  33
EON NETWORK BRIEF DESCRIPTIONExscudo IntegrationThe majority of the code of the Exscudo ecosystem is proprietary because of our security policy. However we try to make the ecosystem as transparent as possible to the community and open to integration with other services and platforms.We will publish the source code concerning consensus rules, coin emission and block con rmation on GitHub. The description of the mathematical model is available in the EON whitepaper on the site eontechnology.org.For more information on building additional services and applications on EON, integrating new smart transactions (smart contracts) into the blockchain platform third- party devs should contact our team for additional information.In the future we will release API for merchant services and API for exchange trading, which will allow many services to be integrated into our ecosystem.Security and AuditIn the second quarter of 2017 we are conductingan external independent security audit of the EON blockchain. During 2017 we are conducting an external security audit of all components of the exchange ecosystem.In addition, during 2017 we will conduct an external independent audit of the public part of the ecosystem and all innovations that we will use to work with banks and external services.We will publish the source code concerning consensus rules, coin emission and block con rmation on GitHub. The description of the mathematical model is available in the EON whitepaper on the site eontechnology.org.Our philosophy is based on three main principles:1. Creating a reliable technology platform with deep protection from external threats.2. Protection from human factor and human errors.3. Protection against unauthorized access to insider information. 34
EON NETWORK BRIEF DESCRIPTIONAn important component of our protection is the EON blockchain, which allows us to eliminate direct access to cryptocurrencies and store them in secure cold wallets, and to store  at currencies in a bank account.Due to the blockchain platform and Colored Coins technology, trading on the exchange is carried out through the exchange of colored coins, which are equivalent to and can be redeemed for the corresponding cryptocurrencies and  at currencies.In addition, due to the team’s high competence in building banking and exchange products, we use advanced architectures and security solutions in our products. 35
COINS AND ICOICO GoalsIn Exscudo, we are building a new architecture of the  nancial ecosystem and therefore do not want to follow the standard pattern, the beaten path of centralized venture  nancing, creating another tool of the old economy, as so we are holding an ICO. And we invite the community to become our shareholders.One of the main objectives of the ICO is the launch of the decentralized EON network, and the organization of the collective ownership of the EON network.Every EON coin holder can start his or her own node, deposit the coins and get the commission from the transactions processed by the node.In addition, due to the capitalization of the network,we plan to accelerate the launch of the products of the Exscudo ecosystem to the market. And also to ensure high liquidity of the Exscudo ecosystem, in order to provide the community with low fees for  nancial transactions in the ecosystem.ICO PlanThe ICO will be held in one stage, which will last 37 days, from April 25 to May 31, 2017.A few weeks before the ICO, coins pre-order will be launched. You can book some volume of EONs in your account before the ICO starts.Those who book the investment package in advance and buy them out within the  rst 48 hours during the ICO will receive a 10% bonus in the form of additional EONs to the account.All pre-orders will be listed in one common ‘book’ and will be closed upon the appropriate payment within 48 hours from the start of ICO in higher priority than other orders.Besides, those who buy non-reserved coins during the  rst week of ICO are awarded with 5% bonus coins. During the second week the bonus is 2.5%. There will be no bonuses during the third week and later. 36
COINS AND ICOIn addition, all those who participate in the ICO will receive a bonus for their personal account on the stock exchange. Everyone who participates in the ICO will get a zero commission for all operations on the exchange for a daily trading-exchange volume equal to the amount invested. This lifetime privilege is assigned to your account.All pre-sale coin orders will be listed in a single orderbook. The coins that have been reserved in advance can be redeemed within 48 hours of the start of the crowdsale. At the same time, payments received for the purchase of the coins in the  rst 48 hours will be closed according to the priority order from the orderbook.Payments received outside the presale campaign will be closed in the order in which the payments are received. 37

COINS AND ICO62.8%of all coins will be distributed to the community during the ICO.15%of all coins will be distributed as options among the members of the team and the supervisory board.20%of all coins will be allocated to the technical fund for the initial stabilization of the network. They will not enter the market in the next a few years as they will be deposited on corporate Exscudo nodes.
